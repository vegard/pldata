    <desc>This European seabass is no one to mess with. He has a dreadful temper and glares at everyone and everything around him. If this fish had teeth he wouldn't hesitate to cut everyone to shreds, thankfully he is tooth-less and doesn't commonly get over a foot long. He has a very sleek and slippery atramentous colour, turning a slight aurous on his back. His belly is the only part of him that is a ghostly colour, the rest is dark and forbidding.

`sAbout Us`X
 
We are Project Legilimensia, Mugglenet's game developers.  Legilimensia:Morsmordre is a RPIMUD (Roleplaying Intensive Multi-User Dimension) that allows you the freedom of interacting and expressing yourself with other players through roleplay (or RP for short).  Since there is no hard-coded magic system, you have the luxury of creating and describing your own spells.  Morsmordre features a moderated, freeform player vs. player combat system to simulate duels.  You are free to emote your own battles in private or request one of our game's judges to arbitrate and challenge your RP skills. You are encouraged to develop your character's history, personality, and decisions to enrich your experience on this game, as well as help create the numerous plotlines woven into the environment.
 
In addition to our RP system there are quests, objects, and non-player characters to interact with.  We are continually developing additional quests for those who feel adventurous.  For some time Project Legilimensia has had another enterprise underway, building a fully-integrated, next-generation MUD based on JKR's world.  For more information on Legilimensia:Morsmordre, as well as our main project, please visit our forum at: http://lumos.mugglenet.com/forums/index.php

`sThe Storyline`X
 
Little Hangleton is the rural community Lord Voldemort's parents inhabited before their untimely deaths.  As you probably have heard, many years later Lord Voldemort's powers vanished, as well as his body, when he attempted to kill the infant Harry Potter.  Thirteen years later, in the graveyard of Little Hangleton, Lord Voldemort magically formed a new body for himself, as if rising from the grave. The night he emerged, Voldemort failed, once again, in his vain attempt to finally vanquish Harry Potter. Enraged at the escape of this boy from Lord Voldemort's grasp, a band of rogue Death Eaters disrupted the peaceful life of Little Hangleton, terrorizing the inhabitants all in the name of revenge. Besides the frightened wizarding community, this heinous event left the hamlet full of petrified and mystified Muggles struggling with the horrific memories of the battle and adversaries they could not fight.                                                  
 
The Ministry of Magic (MoM for short), the administration who regulates the magical community in the United Kingdom, were appalled at the destruction wreaked upon the small hamlet by, what they believed in the beginning, a band of miscreant wizards instead of Death Eaters...though eventually that hypothesis changed. In order to keep their secret wizarding life intact and to facilitate what harmony the Muggles once had before the devastation, the MoM performed a spell upon the inhabitants. All Muggles, whether living in or visiting the village, have their memories and any mention of this disastrous event altered, making every wizard or magical being appear as ordinary citizens or animals.  
 
Several wizarding families already resided in Little Hangleton before this ghastly event occurred.  After the enchantment had been performed upon the locale, the MoM asked these families to keep a watchful eye on the village.

`sThe Main Families and Travellers in Little Hangleton`X
 
The benefit of being in a family is that you're guaranteed housing, money, and allies.  Those who decide to go it alone are just that, left to their own devices.  If you wish to become part of a family after you've enrolled simply send a &lt;note to admin&gt; to petition for a place.  
 
The Travellers are those who do not wish to belong to a family.  They are the lone wolves who prefer to travel light, and as they please.  To learn more detail about this choice, visit: http://lumos.mugglenet.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6155

`yExamining Your Surroundings`X
 
First off, if any instructions are given to you, by means of looking at the help list, or by other characters or an immortal, anything in &lt; &gt; is the word to type.  Do not type the &lt; or &gt; symbols.  
 
Next, to see what the room looks like, type: `ylook`X or try using `yL`X.  To look at a player (called a PC), type: `ylook &lt;name&gt;`X.  Next, if you're interested in what an object looks like, type: `ylook &lt;object&gt;`X.  To see a non-playing character (called a NPC) or an animal/creature, type: `ylook &lt;name&gt;`X.  Some items that are 'paper' related, like this Little Hangleton Handbook, can be explored by typing: `yread &lt;item&gt;`X.

`RAmbling About Little Hangleton`X
 
To move between rooms in this game you need to type the direction you would like to go.  The possible directions available in Little Hangleton are`R north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, up, and down`X.  You can abbreviate these directions with: `Rn, s, e, w, ne, nw, se, sw, u,`X and `Rd`X.
 
Following the room description is a mini-map that indicates where you are located and where you may go.  If you do not see the mini-map, it is most likely indicating that the room is dark from night or the type of room it is.  You will need to use a source of light to see within said room.  Closed doors will not be shown on the mini-map.  You will have to open the doors to see them displayed on the mini-map.
 
To ascertain what exits are available, type: `Rexits`X.  Not all existing exits may be labelled in the room or the exit list.  Some appear hidden, but simply have a closed door.  To exit the room you will have to first locate the door, either by information given in the room description, or by typing a direction to see if it states there is a closed door, etc. To open the door, type: `Ropen &lt;direction&gt;`X.  Once the door is opened, type the direction once more to walk through.  If you see a direction in `R( )`X, this indicates the exit has an opened door, meaning you can walk through and/or close it.  To close a door, type: `Rclose &lt;direction&gt;`X.  If you are unable to open a door it's a signal that you need a key or password to get through.  If you obtain a key, type: `Runlock &lt;direction&gt;`X and then proceed to open the door as normal.  
 
Even if there is no appearance of an exit, there can be a 'hidden' exit.  Exits that are concealed can lead you to something valuable or be the starting point of a quest.  To ascertain if there's a hidden exit, you need to pay special attention to the room descriptions, any possible items mentioned in the description that can be looked at, fleeting bits of information that flit through the room (called echoes), or conversations you have with NPCs.  At this point you must figure out how to open the exit (again, by keywords, keys, or passwords) or as if using a 'normal' exit.
 
In some inns and shops if you type: `Rlist`X you can view the service or items for purchase.

`BPlayer Repartee`X
 
To chat with someone in the same room with you, use: `Bsay &lt;message&gt;`X.  To direct an exchange to one particular person in the same room with you, type: `Bsayto &lt;name&gt; &lt;message&gt;`X.  As a shortcut you may use an apostrophe, `B'`X instead.
 
To send a person a private message, type: `Btell &lt;name&gt; &lt;message&gt;`X.
 
To send a personal communique to another person on or off the game, you can use our note system.  Type: `Bhelp note write`X to read more about how to write notes.
 
To send a global message for help, you may use: `Bnewbie &lt;message&gt;`X.
 
To communicate on a global channel for out of character exchanges (use sparingly), type: `Booc &lt;message&gt;`X.
 
To chat with someone in a private room, type: `Bgoooc`X.  To return type: `Brecall`x.

`YObtaining Objects`X
 
To take objects, type: `Ytake &lt;object&gt;`X.  Or, if you prefer, use `Yget &lt;object&gt;`X.  To wear an item, type: `Ywear &lt;object&gt;`X and to remove it, type: `Yremove &lt;item&gt;`X.
 
To give something to another person that you're either holding or that is in your inventory, type: `Ygive &lt;item&gt; to &lt;name&gt;`X.  You can also just `Ydrop &lt;object&gt;`X to rid yourself of any item you possess.  
 
To check what supplies you have on your person, type: `Yinventory`X. To see what items you are using, type: `Yequipment`X.  Additionally, you can use: `Yshow &lt;item&gt; &lt;name&gt;`X to show another player a certain item.  While you are wearing/holding an item or have it in your inventory, another player can't see the full detail of said object.  Showing the object allows others to see what you see.
 
If you are in a room without light, all you will see in your inventory is the light itself, until you type: `Yhold &lt;light source&gt;`X.  To rid yourself of all your articles, type: `Ydrop all`X.
 
If you try to `Ylook`X at an item, but see a different description than you should, you are probably holding an item that uses the same keywords as the item you wish to view.  For example, if you are holding a red rose and try to look at a red robe in the room you're occupying, it will most likely show you the rose instead.  If you are looking at an item and not receiving the description you should, please try to `Ylook &lt;different word&gt;`X.

`gPlayer Personification`X

For `g`X`groleplaying (RP)`X`X`X, socials allow you to perform actions in the game that make your stay with us seem more personal.  To see a list of socials you may perform, type: `gsocial`X.  Some socials can be directed to other players.  To do so, type: `g&lt;social&gt; &lt;target&gt;`X for example: `gsmile Harry`X.  `gsocshow &lt;social&gt;`X will give details on what action(s) the social does, but we'd advise you simply experiment and have fun. 
 
Emotes allow you to write your own personal interactions.  You do this by typing: `gemote &lt;your action&gt;`X.  For example, typing: `gemote thinks you are pretty`X would show up as: `g&lt;your name&gt; thinks you are pretty`X to everyone in the room.  You may use a comma `g,`X as a shortcut for 'emote'.  To learn about other 'motes' you can use, type: `ghelp pmote`X, `ghelp smote`X, and `ghelp amote`X.

`MMay We Be of Assistance?`X
 
To put items into receptacles, you type: `Mput &lt;object&gt; in &lt;object&gt;`X. 
 
To look into things, such as rucksacks, chests, wardrobes, etc., you can type: `Mlook in &lt;object&gt;`X.  If you wish to retrieve an item you find within, you must type: `Mtake &lt;object&gt; from &lt;receptacle&gt;`X. 
 
To get help on many of the things you will face in this game, use `Mhelp`X.  This will bring up a list of things you can get additional help on.  If you need additional aid, as some things are not on the help list, you can try one of a few ways.   Feel free to ask season veterans or ask on one of the global channels if an immortal is around to help you.  If you wish for private help feel free to send a `M&lt;note to immortal&gt;`X or, for even more privacy, send a `M&lt;note to admin&gt;`X which is seen by only three people on this game.
 
If you misplace an item please go to the Town Hall and talk to the secretary.

`RSafety Measures`X
 
Unfortunately, the internet is no different than 'real' life.  There will be people who are aggressive, and others that may try to make you uncomfortable.  There are steps you can take to ensure your feeling of safety and security on our game.
 
If someone is making you uncomfortable, but you don't feel in any immediate danger, please type: `cpray &lt;message&gt;`X.  If staff is on the game, we will come to your aid.  If a staff member is not on the game at that time, please send a `Ynote to Law`X detailing the situation -this note will be sent to the Judges, Immortals, and Admins.  If it is a judge who is harassing you, please send a `Bnote to Imm`X -this will reach both the Immortals and Administration.  If an immortal is harassing you, please send a `Gnote to Admin`X`X. We will try and deal with your complaint as promptly as we can.
 
If you are in immediate danger, or someone is persistently harassing you, there are several steps you can take:
 
1, type: `Rcrisis &lt;message&gt;`X -the message can be as simple as &quot;help&quot;.  If there is a staff member on the game, judge or immortal, we will immediately come to your aid.  As opposed to `cpray`X, this message broadcasts immediacy for staff to act without delay.
 
2, if there is no staff member in-game, and you feel comfortable using the out of character channel that every person playing the game sees, please type: `mooc &lt;message&gt;`X  - any staff available, and potentially any of the other players nearby will come to your aid.
 
3, if you are uncomfortable asking for help on any of the channels, but need sanctuary from an aggressor, there are a couple of things you can do:
 
A, type: `Mgoooc`X  -this will transfer you to a communal, out-of-character room.  From the common room go `Mnorthwest &lt;nw&gt;`X or `Mnortheast &lt;ne&gt;`X; these rooms are private.  No one will be able to get into those rooms except immortals.  This will allow you to escape the situation.  With this privacy you will be able to write a `Bnote to Imm`X or `Gnote to Admin`X in relative safety.
 
B, remember, if none of these options work, or you don't want to handle this in-game, you can ALWAYS type: `rquit`X and you will be immediately disconnected with all of your items saved.  Then you can go to our public forum http://lumos.mugglenet.com/forums/index.php and send a private message to Artemis, Calliope, or Darkly Marked.  The admin team will then handle it.

large, stone sign, stone sign, on which hands non-too-skilled with a chisel 
have carved: &quot;Verspetillio Turris&quot;.  The columns themselves sport detailed 
and gory engravings of various vampires and men with stakes.  A dusty 
chandelier illuminates the room with dozens of flickering candles.  The 
floor is made of black and white marble and looks very much like a 
chessboard.  A tiny door, with rusted hinges, stands to the side of the 
stairs.  A large, thick, wooden door is jammed shut on the east side, a 
thin, metal door with a small glass window is to the south, and to the west 
lies a pair of shiny, swinging, double doors with no handles.  Other than 
the four doors, the only way out is up.

    <desc>Rows and rows of racks, holding costumes, dresses, aprons and capes, line the walls of this damp, perfectly square room. Patches of moss and moist, green mold flourish between exhausted flagstones on the floor. Enormous, rusty, iron vats are placed across the room and a very large block of soap stands on the floor near one of the laundry vats. The sweet smell of soap, mingled with the sharp stench of decay, fills the room. Four lamps, hanging down from the ceiling, light the windowless space. There is a capacious, albeit empty, fireplace with a metal clothes rack hanging above it, suspended from the ceiling. Each wall has a single door, exiting either to the east, west, north or south.

    <name>Third Draft Desolare Corridor</name>
    <copyright>Copyright © 2005  Nicole &lt;nmhcat@hotmail.com&gt;</copyright>
    <desc>This stretch of corridor is damp, with an abundance of moss and algae 
invading the cracks between the stones that make up the walls.  The growth 
is more profuse towards the south, and from that direction wafts the odour 
of rot and soap.  In the flickering light shed by the torches lining the 
walls, it is evident that creatures which enjoy the damp conditions have 
made this section of corridor their home.  Oversized black beetles, 
centipedes and cockroaches can be glimpsed between the rank patches of 
vegetation.  There are exits in all four cardinal directions: north, south, 
east, and west.

    <desc>This large, untidy room shows signs that it is currently used as a staff 
break area.  Greasy tables sit at odd angles, with dilapidated, wooden 
chairs scattered about the space.  Old copies of the 'Daily Prophet' are 
littered about.  Lit by flickering torches set at regular intervals along 
the smooth, grey, stone walls, this room still holds shadows in the corners 
and in the upper reaches of the vaulted ceiling.  Corroded, metal rings are 
fastened between each pair of torches, positioned about seven feet off the 
floor.  There are five exits leading out of this well-travelled area.  Three 
- to the east, south, and southeast - lead to cells.  A stone archway to the 
west frames the entrance to another staff break room.  Through the northern 
exit, a stairway is visible.

Corroded, metal rings, bolted to the walls, would have served as places to 
chain captives before a cell was assigned.  One ring still holds a pair of 
shackles.  Most of the others have been pressed into service as places to 
hang damp cloaks.

    <desc>.   This section of the kitchen appears as though it was made to breed 
bacteria rather than have food made in it. The floor is covered in a thick 
layer of grime, on which small footprints can be seen. The seven-foot, metal 
ceiling is completely bare save for rust. There is a small fireplace from 
which a pathetic fire burns as though it, too, has had the joy sucked out of 
it. It serves as the only, gloomy, light source in the room. A stove sits 
off the wall as though it is uncomfortable, and a pot sits in the centre 
burner. On the northern, southern, western, and eastern walls there are claw 
marks three feet off the ground near each exit.

    <desc>With low ceilings and uneven, slate floors, this kitchen wouldn't be a 
chef's first choice of food preparation space.  Grease has built up between 
the slabs of slate on the floor.  Sticky grime, originally spattered from 
pots and grills, adheres to every surface and has picked up a layer of dust 
and dead insects over the years.  The lingering odour of scorched potatoes 
and stale grease fills the space.  In one corner is a heavy, antiquated 
stove with a smooth, cast-iron cook top.  Slapdash work surfaces, little 
more than planks bolted to sawhorses, complete the furnishings.  Blackened, 
begrimed pots hang from iron hooks on the walls.  Torches hung on the walls 
provide wavering light.  There are four exits to this room, to the north, 
south, east, and west.

burnt, solid fragments behind it.

    <desc>A dingy placard reading 'Visitors' hangs on the wall of this long, low, 
windowless room.  Designed neither to reassure nor welcome guests, it is 
intended to ensure that visits are as brief and infrequent as possible.  The 
torches hung at either end of the room fill the space with dim, ruddy light. 
 Shadows flicker and dart like malevolent birds.  The walls are coated with 
some sort of slick, greenish growth, and it is from this greasy fungus that 
the damp, musty smell issues.  The room contains a single, rickety table, 
placed in the precise centre of the slimy, stone floor, flanked by two, very 
uncomfortable, wooden chairs.  On the south wall a set of manacles and 
leg-irons is bolted securely to the stone, for those prisoners safe enough 
to leave their cells for a visitor, but not trustworthy enough to sit in a 
chair.  There are exits to the north, south, east, west, and northwest.

area with significant traffic.  The space is relatively bright, with torches 
every few feet along the east wall.  In the northeast corner, placed to take 
advantage of the light, is a workbench, the top cluttered with a variety of 
tools.  Shelves on the west wall hold a variety of cleaning equipment.  The 
slate floor is coated in dust.  Several of the thin flagstones are broken 
and footing is treacherous.  The walls are barely visible, covered by 
apparatus and supplies of every description hanging from hooks and hangers 
of all types.  A bucket sits in the southwest corner, half full of murky 
fluid.  There are exits to the north, south, east, and west.

    <desc>The stone walls are nearly hidden beneath a layer of slime. Green, bubbly 
gook oozes through the cracks on the floor, ceiling, and wall. The low 
ceiling and curvy walls entrap a putrid smell in the corridor. There are 
many torches lighting up the hall though mostly all that can be seen is 
grime. The corridor extends north, east, and south while leading west to a 
cell.

stones that make up the corridor. A greenish gray, the slime bubbles 
slightly as if it were being heated. Puddles of the vile substance are 
formed on the floor where a large quantity of it oozed through the same spot 
for a long time. Small bugs are trapped in the gook, unable to free 
themselves though seemingly alive. The substance lets off a horrible smell 
which hangs the air in the corridor.

    <desc>This dank corridor is lit by a pair of torches in rusty, iron holders.  The 
grey stone of the walls and floor is rough and unfinished, providing 
slightly-better footing than smooth, slick flagstones would have in this 
damp environment.  The passage is just wide enough to allow a prisoner 
flanked by guards to squeeze along.  The corridor stretches into the gloom

    <desc>This circular, stone room is lit by oil lamps, sitting on simple, 
wrought-iron brackets, upon the walls.  The warm light is not enough to add 
comfort to what is essentially a bleak space, but someone has been making an 
effort.  Obviously created to house the wide, spiral staircase that 
dominates the space, the rest of the room is an afterthought at best.  
Chiseled with some care into the grey, stone wall, next to the door, are the 
words Aelati Turris.  A poster of England's Quidditch team is pinned up near 
the stairs.  A parchment hangs next to it, bearing marks in black ink.  
Besides the stairwell leading up, there are exits to the north, south, east, 
west and southwest.

    <desc>The stench of mould overpowers this dank chamber and the monotonous drip 
from a leak in the ceiling plops rhythmically, splashing into a murky pool 
on the uneven stone floor.  Muculent, stone walls form four archaic and 
imposing archways in this chamber, facing the four compass directions.  The 
shadowy darkness is barely penetrated by the pitiful candlelight that 
flickers uncertainly in the northeastern corner.  The room itself is a vast 
emptiness, a mere passageway between rooms that no sane mortal could wish to 
inhabit.  A hollow echo reverberates around the room, seeking solace where 
there is none.  It is possible to travel east to a staff break room, south 
to a cell, west to a staircase, and north.

home in the large room. Torches litter the stone slabs which serve as walls 
and the perfectly-even ground is hidden beneath a red rug. A fire burns 
merrily against a wall, and atop the fireplace is a small sheet. A metal- 
barred door on the far wall leads south, to a cell. There are three other 
exits: north, to the infirmary; east, to another Staff Break Room; and west, 
to a corridor.

    <desc>The nauseating stench of raw meat overpowers the senses in this cold room.  
Chains clatter and clink against the forbidding, stone walls, attached to 
manacles that glow strangely.  A crude, bloodstained, wooden bed, a 
cupboard, and an open, wooden barrel form the only furniture in this 
scarcely-prepared infirmary.  The shadowy darkness flickers uncertainly in 
the flimsy light cast by a single torch.  The uncertain quality of the 
illumination must make it difficult for any medical staff to properly 
inspect a patient.  There are exits to the north, west, east, and south.

piece of thick plywood, with four legs nailed on haphazardly.  The lack of 
bed coverings ensures that the discomfort of the patient is not in any way 
lessened, but also ensures that the large, dried bloodstain in the centre of 
the bed is exposed for viewing.  The bed is much larger in size than would 
be considered normal in a Muggle hospital.  The strangest feature of the bed 
is a loop at its end, large enough to hook something hefty to and glowing 
strangely.

and containers, some bearing harmless-sounding labels, such as 'Rosemary 
Leaves', 'Wolf Hair', or 'Cabbage Leaves', while others carry the more 
menacing labels of 'Bubotuber Pus' or 'Acromantula Venom'.  The bottom shelf 
is different from all the others, containing a number of crude-wire racks, 
sitting on top of each other.  Strangely, they contain a range of Muggle 
instruments, including a pair of rusty forceps and a plastic box, filled 
with tiny sutures.

waste that are in varying states of decay.

    <desc>This room is relatively dust-free, though not truly clean, nor in good 
repair.  Chips have been knocked out of the grey, stone walls and there are 
dark smears marring the faces of the blocks.  There is an indentation in the 
north wall; the stone surface is bowed out slightly and the stones there are 
cracked.  A dark, brownish stain on the slate floor could be from blood.  
One of the torches lining the room is bent out of shape, its flame lopsided. 
 A stone, spiral staircase fills the centre of the room, offering exits both 
up and down.  A sign is carved into the stone column supporting the stairs.  
There are also exits to the north, south, east, and west.

      <desc>Web-patterned cracks radiate out from an indentation in the rough outline of 
a huddled, human form.  The hollow is an inch deep at the centre, the stone 
there crushed by the force of an impact.  Loose fragments of rock rest in 
the crevices.  The wall's surface is marked with dark, rust-brown smears and 
the floor below is stained.

    <desc>A landing of the stairwell stretches.  Its walls are made of grey stone.  
The floor is also stone and looks slightly worn from old traffic.  Though 
lit by two torches, a dark aura exudes through the room, as though the cell 
has seen death strike more than once within its walls.  To the north is a 
cell door, which gives off some slight heat.  The south also holds a cell 
door, yet that direction doesn't seem to emit the same heat.  The west holds 
another section of a landing and also a way to continue upward.  While there 
is a stairwell leading downwards from here.

    <desc>The walls in this corridor are riddled with haphazard cracks, some tiny, 
others large enough to insert a fist.  Despite the crumbling mortar, the 
massive blocks that make up the walls look immensely heavy.  An abundance of 
tiny tracks in the dust on the stone floor indicates that the prison's 
smaller inhabitants travel this way more frequently than the large ones.  A 
set of narrow, shadowy stairs lead down into the floor.  Some sort of 
inscription is carved into the top step, barely visible in the torchlight.  
Besides the stairs, there are exits to the north, south, east, and west.

    <desc>With a slick, slate floor and cobweb-decorated ceiling, this corridor 
contributes to the oppressive, maze-like aura of the prison.  Torches, hung 
on the unfinished, stone walls, provide what light there is, wavering in the 
endless draught.  Shadows flare and shrink in the uncertain light, 
alternately pouncing and retreating.  Home to the usual creeping insect 
life, the corners, piled high with gummy dust, crawl with motion that is 
only partially due to the flickering torchlight.  Exits to the north, south, 
east, and west offer escape.  A dark stairway leads down into the shadows.

    <desc>This corridor is fairly dry and feels almost warm, thanks to the abundance 
of torches hung head-high every few feet.  The ridged flagstones underfoot 
are coated with dust rather than mildew.  A number of creatures that enjoy 
the conditions in this corridor have settled in.  Where the rough stone of 
the walls meets the slapdash plaster on the ceiling, an abundance of spiders 
have evidently been hard at work: their webs hang, thick and heavy, all 
along the hallway.  There are exits to the north, south, east, and west.

    <desc>This wide, vaulted corridor generates echoes from every tiny sound.  It is 
difficult to guess where a noise originates or how loud it might have been.  
Every footfall bounces of the smooth, stone walls and the slick, slate 
floor, magnifying and reflecting into a multifaceted cacophony, crisp-edged 
and hollow.  Torches, mounted in pairs, light the area, throwing twinned 
shadows.  Bare of cobwebs and insects, the main feature of this space is a 
layer of gritty dust.  There are exits to the north, south, east, and west.

    <desc>This dark, windowless cell is lit only by patches of phosphorescent lichen, 
which grows on the unfinished stone of the ceiling.  The eerie, greenish 
light is barely sufficient to see the heap of musty straw at the south end 
of the cell and the ironbound, wooden door in the north wall.  The granular 
surface of the walls casts minute shadows in the gloom.  This mouldy, ten 
foot squared cell offers just enough room to pace.  It appears that a former 
prisoner did that very thing, for a channel has been worn into the slate 
floor on the east side of the room.

      <desc>A channel, roughly three steps long, has been worn into the floor.  
Apparently some poor soul trudged back and forth, back and forth long enough 
to wear the undressed stone into a smooth trough.  At one end, the blurred 
outline of a foot is just barely visible in the dim light.  That must be 
where the prisoner pivoted, twisting back to make the three-pace journey to 
the other end of his cell.

some sort of minute insects, possibly fleas.

    <desc>The never-ceasing lapping of water, prisoners screaming or crying 
unintelligibly, and the distant sounds of chains rattling and clanking fill 
the tiny, grey-stoned cell.  A thick, yellow, oozing substance that could 
almost be called a liquid obscures the floor, almost reaching the low, frail 
wooden frame that could be called a bed.  The cruel, empty darkness has 
almost defeated the tiny sliver of light that managed to invade its 
territory through a mere crack in the wall.  The grey stones that form the 
walls and ceiling of the cell are chilled and uninviting, darkened with 
moisture.  The only exit, for those with the freedom to take it, is through 
a solid, metal door to the northwest.

      <desc>The murky filth that covers the floor laps around the base of a small frame 
that has been made from untreated wood.  The bed like structure sits just a 
foot off the ground, and is bare of all comfort, consisting of several 
irregular planks that have been nailed loosely across it.  Being only about 
five feet in length, and about three feet wide, it would certainly be an 
uncomfortable fit for many of the prison's inmates.

    <desc>The smooth, dirty-grey walls and floor of this cell are almost completely 
covered with thousands of tiny runes, painstakingly scratched into the 
surface.  Even a stone slab, obviously intended to serve as a bed, is 
adorned with row after row of tiny symbols.  The heavy, iron door in the 
west wall and the bars on the window in the east wall also bear the 
carefully-applied signs.  The marks twist and flicker in the light of a 
torch hanging from the ceiling.  A powerful scent of mildew permeates the

    <desc>This cell is roughly 6 feet by 6 feet by 6 feet, a perfect cube.  There is a 
slit in the wall with a dismal view over the churning grey water which 
smashes against the wall and, at times during high tide, into the cell.  
Sunlight is scarce, except when the sun is very high in the sky, and even 
then it is still quite dull.  The walls, ceiling, and floor are made of grey 
stone covered in moss and mildew.  Thanks to the sea splashing in, the floor 
is perpetually slippery.  Spiders live in dry spots in the cracks above the 
window.  Occasionally they crawl down into the actual cell, but are 
typically drowned by the splashing waves.  There are sodden, dead spiders 
everywhere, adding to the despair of the cell.  The cell door is to the 
west.

    <desc>The walls of this cell are chilly, damp, and as smooth as glass, magnifying 
the incessant dripping noise of moving water.  The polished, granite 
surfaces are coated with condensation.  The tiny droplets slowly accumulate 
into larger beads, which slowly trickle down the wall.  A groove in the 
floor as wide and as deep as a thumbnail runs around the walls, collecting 
the moisture and draining it down a tiny pipe in the northeast corner of the 
room.  Despite this concession to prisoner comfort, the slate floor is 
perpetually slick with moisture.  A few wide, oak planks, softened to the 
touch by years in a damp environment, sit in the centre of the room, 
intended to allow the prisoner to sleep somewhere marginally warmer and 
drier than the floor.  The air smells strongly of rust and decaying wood.  
The only exit from this windowless chamber is an iron door to the west.  
Light is provided by a torch fixed high over the doorframe.

years in a moist environment.  Here and there are holes where a knot has

by, their pale bodies visible through the knotholes.

the holes.  The slimy collection of drowned insects and fragments of algae 
gathered there confirm it.

smell seems to have pervaded the very walls.  Condensation beads off the

coarse enough to rip unwary flesh.  The floor is no more than bare, jagged 
bedrock, still studded here and there with barnacles.  A sputtering torch 
over the door pushes back the gloom.  The entire cell smells of decomposing 
seaweed and dead fish.  The room boasts a barred window, just above the 
level of the waves outside; the adjacent area is wet from icy spray.  
Slightly-drier spots are crusted with salt.  Against the western wall, next 
to the only exit, is a pile of decaying rags.  Located on the highest, and, 
hence, driest, bit of floor, is, evidently, the bed.

    <desc>This windowless room is oppressively-warm and smells like a tropical midden. 
 The heat isn't from the single torch that lights the place.  The southwest 
wall, where the corroded, iron door is located, radiates heat.  The humidity 
and elevated temperature have made this tiny cell a haven for a plethora of 
crawling things that find the atmosphere congenial.  The cockroaches are the 
size of mice.  Armoured spiders, as big as an outstretched hand, lay in wait 
in the corners, protected by thick tunnels of matted webbing.  A narrow, oak 
plank, cantilevered out from the northeast wall and placed two feet off the 
uneven, slate floor, provides a slightly-drier place to sleep and a 
different class of insect companions.

provides a makeshift bed.  It is already occupied by creatures that prefer 
not to live in the steamy puddles on the floor.  Tiny, spindly-legged 
spiders clamber over the prominent grain with careful, deliberate steps.  
Minute, black ants rush here and there about their unfathomable business.  A 
single, brown inchworm moves determinedly from one end of the plank to the 
other, only to turn and repeat the process.

the north wall and a barred door on the south wall.  Salt-bearing wind 
sweeps unimpeded from the window out the door, sometimes bringing with it 
the lonely cries of the gulls or the sound of the waves.  In the southwest 
corner a thick slab of unfinished wood hangs from iron chains, evidently 
intended as a bed.  The granite walls are smooth and practically seamless, 
though the east wall is covered with tiny black marks.  The granite floor is

without mortar, they fit so closely together that not even a knife blade can 
be wedged in between.  Here and there darker stains of unknown origin taint 
the uniform surface.  Even the door, taking up the south side of the cell, 
is fitted stone, identifiable only by the tiny window no more than a hand 
span wide.  Thin grey light trickles weakly through the metal grille 
separating the room from the corridor beyond.

    <desc>This area smells strongly of dung and wet dog.  An oversized staircase, 
treads scored in a crosshatch pattern, leads to the floor above.  Carved 
into the floor in front of the steps are the words 'Bestia Turris'.  The 
smooth surfaces of walls and floors alike are covered in gouges and 
scratches, some as thick as a man's thumb, others fine as threads.  A heap 
of hippogriff droppings lies against the west wall.  High up on the walls, 
torches do an inadequate job of lighting the yawning space.  Apart from the 
stairs, there is a single exit to the south.

      <desc>Were one inclined to drive a team of horses up to the next floor, this 
staircase would be more than wide enough to allow it.  It's unlikely that a 
horse would readily consent to enter the echoing, cavernous darkness, but, 
from the look of the stains on the stair treads and the scent of fear, that 
wouldn't be a barrier, either.  In the deep grooves that crisscross each 
stair tread are embedded old manure, a variety of animal hairs, and drops of 
dried blood.

      <desc>The otherwise-smooth stone of the walls is marred by thousands of scratches 
and gouges.  Some are thicker than a man's thumb and bespeak terrible 
strength.  A spot near the floor, where a cluster of frantic, fine scratches 
imply that something tried to climb the slick, stone surface, bespeaks only 
terror.

    <desc>This dank, cramped cell is stark and severe.  The room is a dark 
blueish-grey and is only two paces wide and three paces long.  The ceiling 
has a deep slant, the thick door is made of an ancient metal and slants with 
the ceiling.  There is a thin slit near the top of the back wall permitting 
minimal light.  A dark, rectangular stain, shaped like a bed, lies on the 
floor.  The room smells of sweat and trepidation.  A smallish, odd, dark 
stain rests in the corner.  The metallic door lies to the southeast.

    <desc>A thick, red line of blood runs the sixteen-foot circumference of this 
cone-shaped cell. Every four feet along the towering, stone wall a torch 
glows dimly in its metal bracket. The shallow light radiates in a three-foot 
circle so that the centre of the cell is immersed in darkness. In the foot 
of darkness separating each circle of light is a makeshift pyramid of rocks, 
enclosed by four, vertical lines. The door is decorated with many, large, 
metal spikes, so that the dark wood underneath is barely visible. There is 
no handle to the door that it leads east to the Visitor's Area.

    <desc>The cell is a perfect cube with five-foot sides. A small pile of straw, 
presumably to serve as a bed, lies in the corner. The stone walls are very 
uneven. Jagged and sharp, one could easily injure oneself by falling onto 
the wall the wrong way. The floor is similar to the wall, though there 
appears to have been some attempt at evening it out. There is no window here 
and only a single torch glows faintly - threatening to extinguish at any 
moment - from the point where the ceiling meets the wall. There is but one 
exit, east, which is accessible through a metal-barred door.

Nine-foot walls tower over the cold, stone ground. A thick smell lingers in 
the air, radiating from a large patch of mould in a corner. White foam 
seethes through cracks in the stone-block walls, dripping slowly onto the 
floor. Five torches hang from their metal brackets and illuminate the area. 
A sturdy, wooden door leads east, to Desolare.

    <desc>A nauseating stench fills the air of this dank, humid cell. Remnants of a previous inmate remain in the form of blood-stained walls and lettering carved into the stone floor. A gleaming ray of light works its way through a crack in the thick facade, offering a tantilizing hint of the world outside the prison. Surrounding the small crevice are morbid images sketched onto the stone by a chalky substance. A large, wooden crate lay ominously in the corner of the room, with a thin, tattered blanket covering its lengthy surface. Next to the makeshift bed are two small, filthy pales, the contents of which are sprawled across the grimy floor.

their freedom seemingly mocking the shackles of the prisoners.

    <desc>Hemmed in by narrow entrances, topped with raised iron portcullises and 
shimmering fields of magic protection, this check-in point is neither 
welcoming nor inviting.  Protective runes are etched on every available 
surface, from the seamless, slate floor to the close-fitting, grey stone of 
the walls and ceiling.  In one corner huddles a cold fireplace.  A grubby, 
soot-smeared calendar hangs on the wall, within easy reach of the 
ash-covered hearth.  The opposite corner is dominated by a heavy, battered, 
oak desk.  Mounted beside it is a foe glass.  A row of perches, intended for 
message-carrying owls, is outside the barred windows on the western wall.  
Sputtering torches every few feet do little to dispel the gloom and the 
chill.  A corridor leads northeast, into the prison, and a southern archway 
leads out to the wall.

    <desc>A rank, overpowering scent fills this fifteen-foot triangular cell, 
obviously originating from the two dead bodies in the corners.  
Half-decayed, one lies sprawled on his stomach in the south corner with one 
hand reaching towards the door.  The rotting remains of the other body are 
huddled against the walls of the east corner, the skull split open.  Unlike 
the floors, these walls are not dirt.  They are made of muddy brown stones 
that crumble and flake to the touch, and the low ceiling is made of the 
same.  Sweet-smelling green flames burn in the torches mounted in each 
corner of the room, casting a sickly hue through the room and leaving piles 
of green ash on the floor beneath them.  The sweetness mixed with death 
creates a fetid and almost unbreathable odor.

is still some flesh and meat on him, the bones stick out in many places, and 
nothing but scraps of cloth remain of his clothing.

prisoners are drawn, carved, and painted upon this surface, some of them 
whitewashed while others are drawn impossibly high on the ceiling.  The 
ground is composed of broken, faded, paint tiles, many with the initials of 
inmates inscribed upon them.  A single window that leads to the outside is 
barred with vertical black poles, the smells of fish and the sounds of a 
breaking tide entering from the other side.  The single exit is to the 
north through the driftwood, oak door.

      <desc>Copious amounts of carved writing criss-cross and mash across the walls, the ceiling, and even upon the oak door. Tales of false imprisonment, death threats, and ethics on selling leaking cauldrons swirl upon the surface, forming various shapes like clouds on a stormy day. Several of the longer ones have been whitewashed, and in the particular case a list of grievances, only it's numbers are left.  The the rest of the surface is no more than a blackened blasted set of cracks and loose rocks.

    <desc>This tiny room is a near-perfect cube, with sides four feet long.  The 
walls, floor, and ceiling of this uncomfortably-cramped space are covered 
entirely in small, grey, ceramic tiles no more than a squared inch.  The 
chilly air smells strongly of disinfectant, apparently absorbed into the 
porous surface of the tiles.  Careful marks adorn some of these squares.  
The only other relief to the monotony is a squat, grey, metal door on the 
north wall.

recognizable words such as 'icy', 'claustrophobic', and 'confining', but 
some appear to be random.

    <editdraftcomments>Kyle, this is an impressive room.  Though I think if you tried hard enough 
you could think of some creepy echo to throw in.  Just a few, small, 
changes: The penultimate sentence: It is acceptable how it is, the entryway 
to Desolare is to the north, so you should make some mention of that in your 
desc, as it is relevant.  And instead of saying &quot;the exits are..&quot;  , try 
something along the lines of &quot;the wall extends further west and east..&quot;  , 
or something to that affect.  Last Sentence: While entirely true, it is not 
really relevant to the room and can not stay because not all the players 
will know who &quot;Jess&quot; is.  ;) Otherwise, a really excellent room!  Bring them 
on!  Xoxo Jess

    <desc>Wide enough for two guards to walk abreast, this stretch of the Azkaban wall 
provides a bleak, unsheltered path for patrols stretching far to the east; a 
much shorter distance west is the corner of the prison building.  The low 
crenellations bordering the grey, stone walkway do nothing to block the 
stinging winds that continuously whip the prison, flogging the dark-veined 
rock as a jailer might flog a captive.  The wall's surface is cracked and 
crazed here, and the very stonework hums with power, coiled and concealed, 
ready to strike.  The view to the south is little more than empty sky and 
icy sea; were one to look straight down, one might glimpse a narrow fringe 
of rock bordering the cliffs that dive to meet the waves.  The towers and 
roofs of Azkaban to the north may be less desolate, but are scarcely more 
welcoming.

      <desc>The uniform grey of the wall is riddled with dark, fused veins, the reminder 
of some long-ago battle.  Still faintly warm to the touch, these 
crookedly-branching streaks are smooth as glass, reflecting distorted 
fragments of their desolate environment.  Underfoot, the surface has been 
fractured in intricate webs of cracks, but, on close examination, these 
splits extend no deeper than an eighth of an inch into the massive slabs 
that hedge the prison.  Some chips of the stone beneath are, like the 
obsidian seams, vaguely reflective, throwing warped images in random 
directions.

    <desc>Running east and west along the southern side of Azkaban prison, the top of 
this windswept wall provides a chilly and isolated patrol route for luckless 
guards.  To the south, nothing of note breaks the monotony of grey sea and 
empty sky, nor offers relief from the unrelenting buffeting of the wind.  
Constructed of massive blocks of grey stone, the fortifications ignore the 
hostile environment as humans cannot.  The abrasive surface of the stone has 
yielded to neither weather nor the tread of countless feet; the rock 
underfoot is as rough as a rasp, providing good footing even slick with 
sea-spray, but promising painful injuries if one is so imprudent as to slip. 
 The west end of this section of walkway is fragmented by a shallow 
spider-web of cracks, but the rest of it is plain, undressed stone.

    <desc>Bitter winds scour this section of Azkaban Prison's wall, adding to the 
comfortless misery of the bleak walkway.  From this vantage point atop the 
bulwark, the prison to the north is represented by a stygian stretch of roof 
studded by stark towers.  Much of it is in ill-repair, with missing tiles 
and sagging surfaces.  To the south extends the seemingly-boundless sea, the 
waves mercilessly ridden by the hungry wind.  To the east and west, the 
catwalk extends atop the leaden, asperous stretch of stone.  Low, 
crenellated barriers of the same rock border the path, adding to the martial 
appearance of the fortress, if not to the safety of the guards on watch.

protrusions are more suitably sized to be stumbling-blocks than guardrails, 
and any suggestion that they might provide refuge from the howling gales is 
laughable.

    <desc>This flat, broad path ringing the top of the Azkaban Prison wall resembles a 
dismal parody of a widow's walk.  From the grotesquely useless crenellations 
to the unobstructed view of the desolate North Sea, it echoes the rooftop 
walks where a sailor's wife might pace, watching for a sail that would never 
again break the horizon.  There the resemblance ends.  The decrepit roof of 
the prison with its cheerless, stark, grey towers and the rising scent of 
human misery and unthinkable squalor break the illusion.  To the north 
stretches the festering fortress, to the west and east extends the walkway, 
and to the south is a vertigo-inducing plunge to an angry sea.

energy; the thrumming moan is too low to be audible, but disturbingly 
detectable through even the thickest footwear.  Beneath the coarse surface 
of the stone, long bulges reach and grasp like improbable, malevolent tree 
roots invading the dead rock.  The low battlements are not immune to the 
penetrating infection; the swelling wraps them in a tenacious grip.  The 
pulsating is more intense as the path leads to the east, where the veins are 
thickest; to the west, the wall leads away from the unsettling hum.  A 
weather-beaten bit of board is affixed to a crenellation, faded lettering

After this, a series of dates spanning two decades has been marked and the 
lines have been crossed out, one by one.  At the bottom, someone has simply 
scrawled 'Later'.  A protuberance in the stone has evidently grown since the 
sign was mounted; it has bulged out to cover the bottom left-hand corner of 
the sign.  Feathery splinters jut out from beneath the encroaching rock.

stops abruptly as the corner turns north.  Even grime is unable to survive

    <desc>Towards the south of this section of Azkaban Prison's wall, ropy veins of 
dark, slowly-pulsating rock twine through the slate-grey stone.  In a 
half-hearted effort to safeguard passers-by, a guardrail has been fastened 
to the top of the knee-high, notched walls that flank the walkway.  The 
corroded, iron straps holding the rail in place seem precariously thin.  The 
distended growths have invaded well past the rail's reach now, and the 
resulting, uneven footing is a hazard to anyone walking this way.  Anyone 
falling off the western side of the wall would face a mere ten-foot drop to 
the weather-beaten roof of the prison; on the east side, the sheer drop 
running the full height of the wall, is followed by a hundred feet of 
irregular cliff face and the rock-studded sea.  Despite the minor obstacles, 
it is infinitely safer to proceed north or south along the battlements.

Knee-high, crenellated walls flanking the walking surface do nothing to 
avert the worst of the weather.  The eastern side of the path is 
salt-crusted, the leaden grey of the stone lightened by the layer of grimy, 
crystallized sea-spray.  Far below, the waves crash unceasingly against the 
rocky base of the tiny island.  To the west lies the bulk of the fortress, 
shabby roofing and unadorned towers clearly visible.  The walk leads north

uninterrupted to the horizon.

    <desc>Uneven flagstones flanked by low, notched walls provide a bleak path atop 
Azkaban's wall.  A dank, shallow trough in the centre of the walkway, worn 
by centuries of roughshod feet, holds fusty water.  Running north and south, 
the rippled surface of the rough-dressed walk is damp and slippery, but 
passable.  To the east, beyond the knee-high wall, is a sheer, vertical drop 
to the ocean hundreds of feet below.  The western side offers a shorter 
drop, assuming the dilapidated prison roof would withstand the impact of a

      <desc>A brackish mixture of rain, dew, and salt spray fills the depression in the 
centre of the walkway.  The stale, bitter water is no deterrent to the 
abundant growth of pea-green algae that has taken up residence.  Glowing 
with an eerie, sickly, lime light when shadowed, the flourishing organism 
coats the damp rock with a slimy layer of green.  So abundant is the growth 
that it crowds out of its puddle, only to die on the drier surface of the 
flagstones.  A thick coat of desiccated, but still slippery, composted algae 
adheres to the shores of the tiny, fetid lake.

    <desc>This slim aisle of foliated stone tops the intimidating, grey wall of 
Azkaban Prison.  Running north and south, the slate track threads its way 
between a pair of squat crenellated walls.  Too short to prevent a tumble 
over the edge, the only discernable purpose of the stubby barriers is to add 
to the intimidating appearance of the edifice.  The clinging odour of 
sewage, blood, and fear rises from the sprawling prison roof to the west, 
while the tang of salt air tempered with the less-invigorating scent of 
rotting seaweed drifts in from the east.  Far below, the ocean stretches to 
the eastern horizon, unbroken by any comforting sign of safe harbour.

multicoloured splotch.  Like a five-foot-long puddle of shiny, polychrome 
coating, it covers the entire walking surface with splatters extending up 
and over the low, crenellated walls that stand guard on each side of the 
path.  To the east, vibrant drips extend a few inches towards the sea far 
below; to the west, a few scattered drops of gleaming colour mark the dull, 
grimy roof of the prison.  The way leads to the north and south, following 
the bulwark that rings the gloomy edifice.

    <desc>The buckled and rippled flagstones here host a variety of mosses and 
lichens; the slate-grey stone is leprous with blotches in colours ranging 
from ashy-green to sickly-yellow.  The narrow aisle of contaminated walkway 
is flanked by low, notched walls, their darker, coarser stone bearing the 
same wan patches of growth.  The way continues north and south, along the 
top of Azkaban's grim wall.  To the east, the tumbling waves of the North 
Sea are so far below that the tumultuous water looks like grey moire; the 
west holds the dismal bulk of the prison, roofs and towers clearly visible.

mustard-coloured threads, studded here and there with scabrous towers a 
half-inch tall, covers an area larger than a man's spread hand.  A

threateningly like a malevolent heartbeat.

    <desc>The low wall bordering the east side of this walkway is rather the worse for 
wear.  One crenellation is broken off completely, the remaining, jagged 
edges still fresh and dusty-looking.  The corners of the stones to either 
side of the gap are battered and cracked.  One is marred with a broad, damp, 
rust-coloured stain that spreads down to a small splatter on the flagstones. 
 Over the eastern edge, nothing can be seen but a long drop to a turbulent 
sea far below.  The view to the west, past the undamaged, notched guardrail 
there, showcases the decaying roof of Azkaban Prison and the towers that 
stand grim, sentry duty there.  The walk itself leads north and south, along 
the top of the prison's outer ramparts.

    <desc>Exposed to winds from the east and north, this narrow walkway perched atop 
the Azkaban Prison wall is perpetually cold and blustery.  Even on the 
warmest summer days, the north wind carries the bone-chilling cold of the 
ocean to this bleak corner.  Too low to provide shelter, or even to prevent 
a clumsy walker from taking a fall, the low, crenellated battlements 
bordering the path are little more than forbidding adornments to the 
already-cheerless place.  To the southwest stretches the austere landscape 
of Azkaban's roofs, broken here and there by graceless towers standing 
sentinel.  The walk itself extends west and south, through sea-spray and the 
cold, astringent odour of the North Sea; the tossing waves stretch 
uninterrupted to the northern and eastern horizons.

    <desc>Salt-encrusted cracks litter the wall as if they were brown, varicose veins 
spindling their way across the long stretch of rough cement.  Sea-spray does 
more damage to the sagging wall than merely filling erratic cracks with 
salt; the moisture-infused concrete bulges in the centre, leaving a sizable 
dip in the cracked walkway.  To prevent the poorly made structure from 
collapsing, any travelers are forced to walk on the dangerous outer edges of 
the wall.  The low ledge that trims the wall does little to protect any 
pedestrian from falling and is a better mechanism for tripping over for 
preventing sudden death.  The jagged rocks at the base of the wall ensure a 
quick and bloody goodbye.  The wall itself follows a path of two directions, 
east and west, where the high tide floods over the ledge and soaks into the 
concaved walk.

No one would dare use this salt at their table for fear of being poisoned.  Though the salt would cause no harm, the foreboding appearance is enough to convince anyone to not venture out and scrape some off.

The distinct bulge on either side of the wall displays this evidence.

    <editdraft>The grey stone of this narrow, wall-top walk is riddled with cracks and 
fissures; the largest gaps are filled with crumbling concrete.  This attempt 
to stop the deterioration was largely unsuccessful, as the patches are 
crumbling at a greater rate than the rock.  Stretching across the path like 
invading roots, every break in the rough surface contains a brown crust of 
salt from the endless drenching sea-spray.  The ocean to the north spews 
angry columns of foul-smelling water every time a wave rolls in far below, 
against the base of the cliff face.  A crenellated wall, no higher than a 
man's knees, offers scant security against a fall from the wet, slick path 
leading east and west.  To the south of the wall stretches the expanse of 
Azkaban Prison, the dilapidated roofs studded with bleak stone towers.  
Summer or winter, a sharp wind blows here, carrying the sharp odour of 
rotting fish when it comes from the north and the stronger scent of blood 
and despair when it comes from the south.

    <editdraft>Perched atop the impenetrable walls of Azkaban, this precarious, stone 
walkway, leading east and west, is barely an arm-span wide.  To the north, a 
knee-high, crenellated wall provides a token barrier between the path and a 
long drop.  At the base of the high prison walls clings a narrow strip of 
land; below the tenuous pathway, sheer cliffs reach down to meet the 
shifting, grey sea.  To the south, a similar squat wall marks the edge of 
the prison roof; the canted, slate surfaces are riddled with gaps and 
sagging spots.  Exposed to the wind, rain, sleet and sea-spray, the 
flagstones underfoot are cracked and uneven.  Where the rock is not crusted 
with salt, it harbours slippery colonies of algae.

    <editdraft>The grey, slimy paving stones of this slim walkway stretch out to the east 
and west atop the dark, forbidding, outer wall of Azkaban Prison.  Uneven 
and undulating, the walking surface gathers pools of stagnant water in every 
depression.  These stinking puddles are home to treacherously slippery 
proliferations of algae and lichen.  To the north, a crenellated wall 
eighteen inches tall makes a feeble attempt to ward walkers away from the 
vertigo-inducing drop to the seething ocean that lies beyond the safe path.  
South of the walkway, the shabby slate roof of the prison stretches out, 
spiked here and there with tall towers.  North winds bring in the bitter, 
fishy scent of the North Sea.  Winds from the south bathe the area in the 
stench of excrement, fear and rotting flesh.

Rough-hewn flagstones form a path to the east and west, flanked on the south 
by the roof of the prison itself and on the north by a long plunge to the 
restless ocean.  Briny spray hangs in the air, icy even in the heat of 
summer.  Grimy encrustations of pale salt splotch the stone like some 
leprous disease, leaching the colour from the stone below.  Underfoot, the 
salt crystals have been crushed to powder under the guards' boots.  On the 
low walls framing the walkway, the undisturbed crystalline structures form 
tortured spikes and lumps, tainted with seabird droppings, fragments of 
algae, and dirt.

    <editdraft>The sound of determined waves fills the air over this battered walkway.  The 
wind rises and falls, but the waves beat incessantly.  To the north there is 
a long fall to the ocean below.  The path stretches east and west along the 
top of Azkaban Prison's outer bulwark, barely wide enough for two men to 
walk abreast.  The edges are guarded by token barriers, crenellated for 
appearance, rather than functionality; not even a House-elf could take 
shelter behind the eighteen-inch-high wall.  They are the only concessions 
to decorative instinct.  The walkway is composed of plain, grey flagstones, 
their surfaces worn in a shallow trough where the guards on watch pace their 
lonely circuit.  The prison roof stretches out to the south, the slates 
dotted here and there with untidy bird nests.

skinny walkway widens to a curved platform ten feet in diameter where the 
two walls meet.  The stone pavers and the low, crenellated barrier that hems 
them in were once grey, but they are now almost completely whitewashed in 
the droppings of hundreds of gulls.  A dilapidated wooden chair sits near

    <editeds>Hi Juni
 
The echo's golden!
 
As for the ed, I've added prepositions and suggested small changes to avoid redundance. Also, be aware that in a serie of 3 or more, we use the Oxford comma, that is, a comma before the 'and' marking the last addition to the said serie. I have a hunch that your 'and ... and' was a figure of language and not a fault, but I think that in this particular instance, it hinders comprehension, so I've changed it. Last, don't forget to format the draft, desc, and ed! (the command is .w )
 
Also, I'd like you to 'add salty saline numbing prison cracks punctures' to the keywords.
 
See you soon

      <desc>. The sea has thrashed the rocks, cliff, and walls smooth in some parts, 
cracked and miserable in others.  The stones of the cliff have been whittled 
down to only the strongest, as small bits are ripped away by the elements.  
The wall is tried and tested for durability as wind and high tide beat 
against it with a venemous ferocity, and small cracks are widened slowly 
over the years by the malicious sea.

    <editeds>Hi again!
 
For the echo, please change 'high tide' to 'the tide': it's impossible for us to determine of the 4 to 9 will always be a high tide, as these circle.
 
For the ed, please add 'prison azkaban drizzles murky' in the keywords.
 
That's all! Thanks again for helping. :D

    <editfirstcomments>Hi Juni!
 
The desc is mostly golden, and I like the atmosphere you give these pathes! The changes fall in one of three categories:
- I'm suggesting a rewrite for the first two sentences, hopefully making the desc more fluid.
- mind the verb conjugation (though tat may only be typos, which happen... that's why we editors have work!:) )
- you had quite a number of occurrences of ?path?, so I suggested several synonyms or equivalent.
 
See you soon!

      <desc>The vicious sea abuses the sides of the slippery cliff and the imposing 
prison.  The sky is hardly visible through the dense, dark fog that seems to 
always surround the prison.  The deep grey prison wall looms solidly, 
imposing itself upon anyone daring to risk good balance by examining it.  
The drizzle from the ocean spray seem to perpetually stain the wall, and the 
murky water churns violently below.

    <editfirstcomments>Hi Juni, still the same ol' editor here ;)
The desc is mostly golden, with just a few adjustments to help the flow of the sentences. One thing that is bothering me though, is that in room 80067, north of this one, you said the path widens down south, whereas it doesn't seem the case here. Maybe simply the jutting rock is half-blocking an otherwise-large path?

Er, what does this portrait have to do here? O_o Maybe, it was a training thing of something, but I think it should be removed.
 
This'll leave the room without echo or ed, so please add one of the two.

is the cliff face, and below that, the crashing waves.  To the east rises a 
wall that surrounds the fortress commonly known as Azkaban.  The barrier

solid stone, the wall has no cracks and no seams.  There are no trees around 
it, nor bushes or vegetation at all.  The pathway between the cliff and the 
wall is narrow, rocky, and perilous.  The only exits are north and south, 
along the treacherous, narrow trail of slippery, naked cliff.

    <editfirstcomments>Dearest Maryam, well done on writing this room, and well done, Mira, on spotting some of the tiny problems that needed tweaking. I've also checked on the exits and the orientation and thus made a few extra checks. Also, as Carole noticed, you have the brackets that Mira uses for editing still standing in the text of your description, Maryam. The idea is that once you accept the criticism, you remove these brackets. 
 
Some small points you would need to pay a bit of attention to: 1) Do not use right or left, since you don't know from which side the person is coming, nor how he/she is standing in the room. Use cardinal directions instead. 2) Please make sure your directions are as you make them to be; here, for example, the wall and the sea were reversed from what you told us they would be. 3) We use here feet and inches, like in the HP books; so 4 m = 12 ft. also, please do not type numerals as numbers, but in letters: four, twelve. 4) You already had the eastern/western exits in the desc; no need to add them at the end. However, you COULD give us a small description of the path to the north and south. I put there a small example at the end; if you wish to change it, please do, but let us know so we can check it.
 
Awesome job though, and well done on the description of so many elements all at once! Hugs, Cristina

presence of the Azkaban prison's wall, this narrow path continues south 
before rounding of a corner to the east.  Past that, the horizon abruptly 
opens as a cliff face gives way to the North Sea.  The whole western vista 
offers the same, desolate sight of hard, sharp rocks and laden waters; no 
escape seems possible, except right into Death's awaiting arms.  
Incongruous, quaint daisies poke up from between the cracks in the stone.

turn to a northern path before coming to an abrupt stop.  As it is, the 
tall, sleek wall corner stretching to the north and east does not offer much 
escape, though a door can be scarcely made out in its face, farther to the

beyond the rocks, calling to any unfortunate soul weak or desperate enough 
to follow a barely-visible, almost-vertical path to the west.  Still, the 
merciless architects of this place seemed to have seen no reason to keep 
people away from the slippery stone; between the sea and the path there 
isn't even as much as a ledge.

    <editdraftcomments>Dearest Carole, I wasn't sure what you meant in the last sentence, and I found the second to last one a bit vague, so I gave a rephrase. Please feel free to reword any part that doesn't seem good to you. Thank you so much for the hard work, lovely girl! `-Cris

    <desc>This is the southwest corner of the desolate island housing Azkaban Prison.  
The narrow trail here skirts the massive building, perched on a thin ledge 
of unstable rock, between the charcoal-grey, man-made wall stretching up to 
the sky, and a sepia-brown, natural wall plunging down to the ocean.  To the 
east, the track stretches out, paralleling the prison.  To the north, a 
jumble of discarded building materials and cracked lumps of native stone 
allows access to the wall that rings the cheerless jail.

      <desc>This disorderly heap of debris has settled into a tightly-packed hill of 
trash.  A series of worn footholds hint that this is a common method of 
accessing the cliff-top trail.  Moss has taken root in the dirt-filled gaps 
between smashed porcelain fixtures, irregular, umber boulders, and crudely 
squared-off, grey blocks.

    <desc>This path runs east and west, following the stark, lead-grey wall of Azkaban 
Prison.  The grim, castle-like edifice, with its unglazed, barred 
window-slits, blocks the north.  To the south of the trail is a steep drop, 
the crumbling folds of the cliff reaching down to the swirling brine of the 
North Sea.  The salty scent of the water below hangs heavy in the air, 
combating the odour of rot and decay that pervades the prison.  A shelf of 
rough, brown rock carries the tenuous pathway.  Here and there, plants 
sprout optimistically, only to join the general blight.

      <desc>Along the base of the prison's stone wall are the remains of a handful of 
unfortunate plants.  A clump of faded, beige grass stems bristles out at the 
sky, the decayed leaves slumping in slimy tatters towards the ground.  
Silver-grey twigs, some still bearing skeletal leaves, mark the remains of a 
woody shrub.  The twisted, wiry stems of a long-dead vine maintain a 
death-grip on the rough blocks.

    <desc>The slate-grey wall of Azkaban Prison blocks passage to the north.  Stained 
with unidentifiable, dark splotches, the undressed, stone blocks of the wall 
are moist to the touch.  A slender path runs east and west, between the 
prison and a sharp drop-off to the south.  Far below, the North Sea laps 
eagerly against the base of the cliff, eating away at the sepia rock.  
Lichen clings to the folds of the vertical face, disfiguring it with pale 
blotches.

    <desc>This faint path has been eroded by the effects of high winds and harsh 
weather patterns.  It is barely-detectable, scuffed track, balanced on a 
rocky ledge.  With Azkaban Prison looming to the north and a steep cliff to 
the south, it is clear that east and west are the only exits from this spot, 
trail or no trail.  The sheer drop from the southern escarpment ends in the 
churning waters of the North Sea.  Dark-grey stonework, punctured by shadowy 
openings, makes up the high wall of the prison.

    <desc>Azkaban Prison towers to the north of this narrow path.  High above, narrow, 
barred openings in the prison wall mark those fortunate cells with windows.  
The path itself is merely a scuffed track running east and west.  Perched on 
a ledge between the stark, grey wall of the prison and a long drop to the 
ocean on the south, the trail clings to the only solid ground available.  
Tufts of wiry leaves poke stiffly out from the vertical face of the cliff, 
breaking up the drab sepia of the weathered rock.

Azkaban Prison and the brink of a high cliff overlooking the North Sea.  The 
footpath itself is little more than a worn track in the thin soil covering 
the rocks, running east and west.  To the south, the vertical face itself is 
the colour of raw umber, the stone as cracked and crazed as an old master's 
painting.  The prison wall, to the north, is as dull and dark as lead, 
stained, here and there, with patches of emerald-green slime.

    <desc>Narrowing towards the east, broader towards the west, a sill of sepia rock 
carries this erratic footpath.  The trail wavers from the north side of the 
ledge, tight against Azkaban Prison, to the very brink of the cliff on the 
south.  The prison wall is constructed of undressed, dark stone, and, where 
the path approaches it, the abrasive surface has snagged the occasional 
thread.  The cliff itself is the same, umber hue as the ledge, uneven, 
striated, and slightly undercut.  At the base of the drop, the sea scrabbles 
at the stone, its surface tufted with white-topped waves.

illusion of solidity.

    <desc>Sheltered from the north winds by the looming mass of Azkaban prison, this 
footpath runs east and west along a rocky projection that parallels the grim 
building's wall.  Though, farther to the east and west, a wide, stone ledge 
is visible, the trail here leaps from outcropping to outcropping, like 
stepping-stones jutting high above the restless sea.  The escarpment, 
stretching to the broken surface of the water, is studded with similar, 
jagged projections, like coat hooks for passing giants.  Soaring high to the 
north, Azkaban's wall is faced with irregular, stone blocks of charcoal 
grey.

      <desc>The highest of these umber outcroppings serve to hold the trail around the 
base of the prison.  Chiseled to an approximation of a flat surface, the 
tool marks on top of each stone provide secure footing for travelers.  The 
projections farther down the cliff have had no such modifications, and are 
craggy and jagged on all sides.  Bits of debris have lodged on some of these 
jutting, rock formations, captured in the fissures.  A bowler hat, wedged 
upside-down against the vertical face, has become home to a gull's nest.  A 
fluttering fragment of ragged parchment bears the still-legible words 
'Warrant For' in bold print.  A weathered knife-blade teeters precariously 
atop a rakishly-tilted, brown boulder.

    <desc>This disintegrating shelf of sepia rock skirts the southeast corner of 
Azkaban Prison, allowing passage to the north and west.  The ledge varies 
from two feet wide to just under a foot wide where it has weathered and 
broken away at the corner.  The massive cornerstone of the towering, grey 
wall protrudes slightly from the uneven facade.  At the lip of the shelf, 
the solid ground drops away and a grainy, undercut cliff face falls to the 
choppy surface of the sea.  Some sections of the escarpment have 
freshly-exposed surfaces and fractured masses of dark rock are periodically 
revealed by the shifting water at the base of the drop.

crevice, a human fingernail, ripped from its hand, is caught.

    <desc>This intermittent path is tucked tightly against the lead-grey wall of 
Azkaban Prison.  An uninviting stench wafts from the rough stones of the 
prison wall to the west of the trail.  The long vertical drop to the angry 
waters of the North Sea to the east is even less hospitable.  The cliff 
shows the ravages of years of erosion, and the grasping hunger of rain and 
wind are beginning to eat away at the stone shelf.  Running north and south, 
the trail dodges the worst of the crumbling fissures.

    <desc>This uneven shelf of terra-cotta-coloured stone juts out from the base of 
Azkaban Prison's soot-grey wall.  To the east, a cliff plunges into the sea, 
its sepia surface resembling a jumble of pottery shards inexpertly glued 
together.  The prison blocks the west, leaving travel possible only to the 
north and south.  Worn shallowly into the rock, a trail is faintly visible 
along the rocky ledge, skirting the dark wall as closely as possible.

    <desc>Tucked in beneath the dubious shelter of Azkaban Prison's high wall, this 
isolated path is barely wide enough to travel.  Between the somber bulk of 
the prison on the west and a sheer escarpment to the east, the trail perches 
on a narrow ledge running north and south.  The cliff face is as grainy and 
cracked as an old sepia-tone photograph and very nearly the same shade.  
The ledge, of the same, patchy, brown rock, is curled and crumbling at the 
edge.

    <desc>This thread of a footpath leads north and south along a ledge, barely two 
feet wide.  To the east, the ground falls away leaving a cliff that drops 
steeply to the surging waters of the ocean.  Splits and fissures riddle its 
vertical face.  A wad of dried vegetation sits loosely in one of the larger 
gaps.  Travel to the west is blocked by Azkaban Prison.  Though darker and 
in better condition than the cliff below, the prison wall is equally 
forbidding.

Azkaban prison, hanging over a sheer cliff.  The ominous bulk of the high 
wall, to the west, is interrupted by regular, inky shapes.  The stone shelf, 
that serves as a path, runs north and south, though the trail is punctuated 
by deep fissures that stretch crooked fingers to the prison itself.  The top 
of the cliff, to the east, is hidden by the protruding rim of rock.  The

to the hungry waves of the North Sea.

    <desc>This slender trail huddles close to the charcoal-grey, stone wall of Azkaban 
Prison.  Punctuated by dark windows, the inhospitable face of the grim 
edifice blocks any other view to the west.  To the east, a precipitous 
escarpment plummets to the restless waters of the North Sea far below.  
Webbed with cracks like ancient pottery, the cliff face is home to little 
more than some ashen-hued lichen.  The path itself runs north and south, 
hemmed in between the sheer drop and the towering wall.  Worn through 
accumulated dirt by the footsteps of the occasional traveler, the trail 
fades from view over rocky outcroppings, only to reappear where a thin 
coating of soil blankets the bedrock.

Only slightly less prominent is the sheer, vertical drop to the roiling 
waters of the North Sea, stretching out to the eastern horizon.  This trace 
of a footpath, squeezed between the ragged brink of the cliff and the high 
wall, follows the only traversable ground, a rocky shelf running north and 
south.  At its narrowest point the shelf is little more than a foot wide, a 
number of parallel grooves scored deeply into the stone.

a foot from the base of the prison wall to the lip of the precipice.  
Shallow and narrowing to a mere point at the wall, they are two inches deep 
and an inch wide at the cliff edge.  All but one cut through the edge, 
opening to empty space.  The southernmost grove ends half an inch short of 
the cliff.  Embedded in the bottom is a single, curved, ivory claw, the top 
raggedly snapped.

    <desc>This precarious pathway leads north and south, balanced between the high 
wall of Azkaban prison to the west and, to the east, a sheer cliff plunging 
down to the ocean.  The cliff face is uneven, a mass of rocky protrusions, 
deep crevices, and hairline cracks.  Much of the surface is crumbling, 
hinting at instability deeper in the rock.  The path itself reinforces the 
impression with a fractured surface: sunken in some places, slightly 
elevated in others.  Miniscule, moss-green plants have taken root in the 
cracks.

a slender footpath.  Running north and south, the rock-studded trail 
provides meager footing.  To the west, the ominous, dark weight of the

enough to shred flesh.  To the east, the ground stops abruptly at a sheer 
cliff, dropping far down to the waves of the ocean below.  A maze of cracks

north-east corner of Azkaban prison.  This dodgy footpath extends west and 
south, following the prison wall.  Mere feet from the grey solidity of the 
grim edifice, the rocky ground drops away at a cracked and jagged cliff 
edge.  Rimmed with crumbling, brown stone, the cliff face is weathered and 
eroded at the island's corner, as if hungry waves have torn massive bites 
from the rock to fill its emptiness.  The swirling waves below hint at the

Prison and a sheer drop to the North Sea, runs east and west.  The prison 
wall, to the south, is punctuated by barred window-slits and the occasional, 
ominous-looking stain.  To the north, the land falls away abruptly, a 
muddy-brown, vertical surface plunging to the churning waters below.  The 
path itself is uneven, a thread of hard ground worn bare by the passage of 
time and foot traffic.  With nothing to break the cold wind from the north, 
the trail and the wall behind it are battered, year-round, by stinging gusts 
that taste of brine.

    <desc>The path is nearly washed out by a constant trickle of foul-smelling water.  
Originating somewhere far up the forbidding, grey wall of Azkaban Prison, 
which lies to the south, the sluggish stream has discoloured the stone 
blocks around it, staining them dark-brown and slime-green.  The path itself 
is crossed by deep, water-carved furrows, choked with long, slick strands of 
green algae.  The brackish flow runs over the precipice to the north, 
splashing against the irregular cliff face on its journey to the sea far 
below.  To the east and west are drier sections of rocky path.

sheer escarpment and the forbidding, salt-crusted wall of Azkaban.  The 
prison, to the south, blocks any view from that direction, but the plunging 
cliff to the north allows a clear line of sight over the tossing sea to the

    <desc>Between the uneven cliff edge to the north and the dark bulk of Azkaban 
Prison to the south, there is barely enough room to walk.  This path leads 
beyond the narrow spot, to the east and west.  The vertical rock face 
extending down to the seething ocean is riddled with crevices, some deep, 
others shallow.  The cracks stretch past the lip of the precipice, 
fracturing the path into sharp-edged segments, like sun-baked mud.  The 
broken stone shifts at the least touch, the grating of stone against stone 
clearly audible over the wind.

    <desc>The biting wind carries the tang of salt from the ocean to the north.  The 
dark wall of Azkaban Prison, looming just south of this path, is little 
protection from the cold.  Squeezed between the prison and the edge of a 
steep drop to the roiling sea, the path stretches east and west.  The 
crevice-riddled ledge is of the same, crumbling, brown stone as the cliff 
face: cracked, uneven, and spotted with damp, grey-green lichen.

    <desc>This path, stretching east and west, is little but a strip of bare, cracked 
rock, squeezed between Azkaban Prison, to the south, and a precipitous drop 
to an angry sea to the north.  The wind growls across the disintegrating 
stone of the cliff face, carrying the chill of the water far below.  The 
odour of brine blends with that of wet rock, with a whiff of the sour smell 
of the prison added when the wind shifts.  Thin patches of green, growing 
matter break up the uniform, dirty brown of the sheer rock, extending down 
to the water.

    <desc>A rough footpath huddles against the harsh, grey solidity of Azkaban Prison, 
following the wall east and west.  To the north, the narrow rim of land ends 
abruptly at a crevice-riddled, vertical wall of rock stretching down to the 
ceaseless, battering waves of the sea.  Stuffed behind an outcropping 
halfway down the cliff is a bundle of twigs and feathers, barely visible 
through the salt spray from below.  The churning water extends to the 
unbroken, northern horizon, exposing the path and the prison wall behind it 
to the worst of the storms that blow in on the north wind.

      <desc>On closer examination, the wad of twigs sheltering behind a jutting rock is 
an old bird's nest.  Carefully woven together with dried grasses and lined

eggshell litter the sheltered hollow in the centre.

    <desc>The brink of the cliff to the north juts up like crumbling crenellations, a 
thumb's width tall.  The heavy solidity of Azkaban Prison to the south is 
the other boundary to the thread of a path running east and west.  Below the 
scant protection of the stone ridge, a wall of fragmented, brown rock drops 
sharply to the shifting waters of the North Sea.  Nothing but the odd 
seabird breaks the view of tossing waves rising to meet the sky.

houses Azkaban Prison.  To the north and west are steep rock faces, 
extending down to the surface of the unquiet sea.  The seething, grey ocean 
extends to the horizon.  To the southeast is the dank prison itself, stark 
and bleak even in this forbidding landscape.  A precarious path follows the 
dark walls to the south and to the east.  The ground here is rutted and 
grooved, the cliff edges undulating along, in some places invading the trail 
itself.

    <desc>Perched on a strip of land between the looming wall of Azkaban Prison to the 
east and a sharp drop-off to the west, this lonely path leads north and 
south.  The abrasive, unfinished stone blocks of the prison wall offer 
little shelter from the buffeting winds.  Stinging grit is carried up from 
the crumbling rock of the cliff face by erratic gusts that scour the path 
and anything on it.  A tiny, green plant clings precariously to the brink of 
the drop.

of Azkaban Prison.  Nothing but the uneven, grey stone of the wall is 
visible to the east.  The west side of the pathway brushes along the edge of 
a sheer escarpment that extends far down, to the turbulent waters of the 
ocean below.  The muddy-brown rock of the cliff face has been etched by the 
scouring winds.  The creviced stone breaks up at a touch.  In one place, a 
deep crack invades the path itself.

high, stone wall of Azkaban Prison.  The rock face below the cliff edge to 
the west is little more than an uneven surface formed of crumbled stone, 
held together with mud, lichen, and luck.  A restive sea ebbs and swells at 
the base of the drop, alternately exposing and concealing barnacle-studded 
rocks.  The windswept trail to the north and south is slightly more 
promising, though the spray-slick, cracked surface is treacherous in its own

the irregular rock face that stretches down from the path to the shifting

green, slimy algae.  The treacherously-slippery plant life has begun to grow

    <desc>The path leads to the north and south, along the edge of the cliff.  Wind 
ceaselessly buffets this spot, even when it is calm elsewhere.  Gusts rush 
in from all directions, swirling and tugging in seemingly random fashion.  
Some are surprisingly powerful, others little more than gentle, sea-scented 
caresses.  The edge of the cliff to the west shows the sculpting effects of 
the capricious breezes.  Carved in convoluted curves, the ground is scoured 
to bare rock and slick with ocean spray, carried by currents of 
bitingly-cold air.  At the very edge of the precipice is a battered, faded, 
wooden sign, held in place by a stake, wedged into a crevice.  There is a 
sheer drop-off to the west.  To the east the solidity of Azkaban Prison's 
wall blocks the way.

    <desc>Fragile fingers of grey-brown rock make up the cliff face, dropping a 
hundred feet or more to jagged slabs of stone, thinly covered by a restive 
sea.  The haunting, desolate beauty of this isolated island is spoiled by 
the ill-omened, dark building that dominates it: Azkaban Prison.  The sharp 
drop of the cliff lies to the west.  To the east towers the sheer wall of 
the prison.  The path continues to the north and south, along the top of the 
precipice.

    <desc>A sheer cliff plummets to the roiling ocean far below.  The rock face is 
crumbling, webbed through with fine cracks.  A few, likely-looking handholds 
have deeper crevices, promising a rapid descent to anyone foolish enough to 
brave the climb.  Halfway between the eroded top and the wild North Sea a 
tiny, grey-green plant has taken root.  To the west is the restless surface 
of the water.  To the east is the forbidding, grey bulk of Azkaban prison, 
and access to the prison wall.  Travel is possible to the north and the 
south, along the cliff itself.

    <desc>Hard, ready-to-crumble rock serves as the base for the intimidating cliff 
edge.  A cold, black, foreboding sea writhes and crashes against it, with 
violent, rumbling sounds.  The air is dank, salty, and insufferably cold.  
The surface of the ground is moist and slippery and it is almost impossible 
to run without falling off one of the cliff's edges.  To the east and west, 
the cliff runs downwards for about a mile until they strike the churning 
water below.  Towards the edges, loose, brown rocks look ready to plummet 
into the roaring abyss.  To the north, the road stretches back towards 
safety, while the only other exit would be to go south, into the sea itself.

    <desc>The dark, violent sea churning all around moves with a life of its own.  
Waves crash into each other, going in no particular direction.  Salty air 
floats above the water, hanging thick and unmoving.  The floor of the sea is 
impossible to view, but one can easily tell the water is unmeasurably deep.  
The ocean is cold, almost freezing, and it would take a lot of energy just 
to move around.  To the north, a sheer cliff edge looms at a distance, 
barring the strong waves from moving any closer.  The sea stretches to the 
east and west as far as the eye can see.

    <editfirstcomments>Hullo, Mira!  I'm a little confused by your edit.  As the list in sentence 2 
is a list of two items, it doesn't need an oxford comma.  Is there another 
reason I need one there?  And the rewritten final sentence 'To the east and 
west also offers passage' is deffinitely missing at least one word.  I've 
put in a different version.  Could you take a look?

    <editfirstcomments>Hi, Mira!  I talked to Tina about the 'Acting as a' in the desc, and she 
agreed with me - though it's not wrong, it's not necessary.  I'd like to 
keep the desc without it, if possible.  In the ED, I also consulted Tina.  
(She was on, after all.)  I need the comma after 'dead-looking' to separate 
adjectives, and the comma before 'to' wasn't really needed.  Please have 
another look now htat I've played with it.  Thanks!

    <desc>The waters of the North Sea are just barely warmer than ice.  The deadly 
chill is transferred to the moisture-laden air at the water's surface.  The 
murky, grey-green waves send up constant sprays of salty water, slowly 
soaking everything nearby.  To the south, the shifting, hostile sea 
stretches to the horizon.  To the north is a craggy cliff face, its 
grey-brown, crumbling rock stretching up to the ominous shape of Azkaban 
Prison.  Travel is only possible to the east and west, in the frigid water 
at the base of the cliff.

    <desc>. With the ebbing of every wave, this sand-laden seawater forms a tiny 
whirlpool between the northern cliff face and a partially-sunken boulder, 
sweeping particles up from the bottom into the flow.  Beneath the murky 
water, the sea floor is riddled with treacherous sinkholes and depressions 
in the sand.  To the south is open sea, stretching to the horizon.  Travel 
is possible along the base of the cliff, through the bitterly-cold water to 
the east and west.  The vertical sheet of rock that dominates the north is 
craggy and weather-beaten; the fragile folds of disintegrating stone 
stretching far up to meet the sky.

    <desc>To the north is a high cliff, topped by the dark mass of Azkaban Prison, 
barely visible beyond the ochre outcroppings of stone.  The water here 
swirls and churns amidst submerged rocks, their barnacled, brown tops 
showing in the troughs of passing waves.  Dirty foam follows the whims of 
the flow, ebbing and rising, sometimes adhering to the vertical rock face, 
just above the waterline.  The air is cold year-round, heavy with salt spray 
and with the stench of rotting fish.  Beneath the surface, flashes of colour 
and motion can be glimpsed though the floating debris.  To the south is 
nothing but open sea.  Travel is possible to the east and west.

    <desc>This turbulent water crashes against the base of high, umber cliffs to the 
north, bringing in the biting scent of the ocean.  When the waves draw back, 
they pull with them the odour of rotting seaweed.  The towering rock face 
above is riddled with cracks.  In a few places, sheltered from above by 
outcroppings, larger openings are visible.  It is possible to follow the 
cliff base to the east or west, slogging through the bone-chilling cold of 
the North Sea.  To the south, nothing is visible but the undulating, grey 
surface of the ocean, stretching out to meet the sky.

      <desc>The largest of these shadowy recesses is barely large enough to admit a 
human head.  In one, the broken dome of a stained human skull is tightly 
wedged, serving as a home for a mossy plant no more than two inches tall.  
Others show signs of habitation by something slightly more vigorous.  The 
entrances are surrounded by dark smears, small, discarded bones, and clumps 
of feathers.

    <desc>The frigid waters of the North Sea swirl and surge amongst these submerged 
boulders.  This shallow area, tucked up against the cliffs to the north, is 
home to a variety of sharp-edged crustaceans, that have cemented themselves 
to the solidity of the rocks and to the submerged sections of the vertical 
face.  Movement is uncomfortable, but possible over the shellfish beds to 
both the east and west.  A steady flow of filthy, lumpy fluid oozes out of a 
hole in the cliff, about twenty feet above the waves.  The nauseating stench 
is strongly reminiscent of raw sewage.  The muck diffuses in the water, 
spreading in a reeking, murky cloud, that washes slowly south, to the open 
sea.

      <desc>An underwater hazard to unprotected flesh, these tidal shellfish sport 
infinite variations of razor-sharp slicing surfaces and jagged edges.  
Barnacles coat the tops of the boulders, with mussels clinging to deeper 
rocks.  Limpets are attached anywhere the crowding allows and the occasional 
oyster is cemented in the water's flow.  Whelks hunt amongst the barnacles 
and periwinkles hide in crevices.

    <desc>The waves batter these rocky shallows at the southeastern corner of the 
isolated island housing Azkaban Prison.  The cliff here has been undercut by 
the rough water, creating a hollow beneath the ocean's surface.  Stretching 
up above, to the west and the north, this umber rock-face is fractured.  
Many of the outcroppings are precariously balanced.  Far away, at the top of 
the cliff, the shadowy form of the prison can be made out through the spray 
that fills the air.  It is possible to inch along the base of the island, 
moving north or west.  To the east and south, nothing is visible but the 
endless billows of the open sea, stretching out to the desolate horizon.

    <desc>The surf pounds these half-submerged rocks, and the eastern, seaward side is 
bare of everything but a few, hardy patches of algae.  In the lee of the 
boulders, however, protected from the wrath of the ocean between the rocks 
themselves and the high cliff to the west, life flourishes.  Colourful 
creatures scrabble through an assortment of stationary animals and an 
abundance of multihued seaweed.  The footing is slippery and treacherous, 
but travel is possible to the north and south.  To the west is the sheer, 
crack-riddled cliff stretching high above and, to the east, nothing but the 
endless rage of the North Sea.

threads an inch tall, it covers the umber stone with a furry-looking mat.

speckled crabs push their way through the inch-high forest of weeds, their 
long, slender antennae waving above the matted, brown plants.  Slim minnows,

    <desc>Three feet beneath the crashing waves, this ledge of algae-covered rock 
skirts the bottom of a high cliff.  Narrowing to as little as eighteen 
inches wide in some places, this precarious path leads north and south.  The 
sepia, rock face rising to the west is pitted with small crevices and dotted 
with crumbling, fist-sized outcroppings.  To the east, the underwater ridge 
drops abruptly.  Any view of the deeper water is blocked by a waving forest 
of brown seaweed, swaying with the action of the waves.

    <desc>This sunken ledge of rock is cracked into razor-edged shards, cemented 
together by encrustations of barnacles.  Stretching ten feet out from the 
base of the cliff that dominates the west, the eastern edge drops off, the 
ocean's depths concealed by a forest of waving, ribbon-like seaweed.  Travel 
is possible to the north and south, parallel to the cliff face.  The wall of 
rock stretching to the sky is cracked like the surface below the waves, as 
if shattered and clumsily reassembled.  Mossy, green lines follow the 
fractures, pointing up towards the cliff edge and towards the shadowy form 
of Azkaban Prison perched there.

    <desc>Breakers crash against the cliff to the west, their effects magnified by 
this band of shallow water at the base of the rock-face.  Even small waves 
gain significant force upon reaching the waist-deep brine over the sunken 
rock.  Below the surface, the uneven, rocky ledge is home to matted patches 
of seaweed, interspersed with sharp-edged shellfish.  Running north and 
south along the base of the cliff, the rocky shelf makes moving in those 
directions feasible, despite the draining cold of the North Sea.  Chilly 
spray has drenched the rocky cliff-face ten feet above the high water line, 
making the disintegrating stone, with its cracks and jutting fingers of 
umber rock, impossibly slick.  To the east, little is visible but the 
rolling sea and the occasional albatross, drifting beneath scudding clouds.

    <desc>The bottom of this fractured cliff is awash in murky seawater, three feet 
deep.  An underwater ridge, riddled with crevices and hollows, runs along 
the base, providing a ten-foot-wide path to the north and south.  Unseen 
beneath the silt-laden water, tiny, hard-shelled creatures scramble 
endlessly over the path and anything on it, their sharp feet clicking and 
scraping.  The vertical rock-face to the west is composed of umber 
rock-shards, wedged together to form an unstable surface held together by 
encrustations of salt and seabird droppings.  To the eastern horizon, the 
North Sea stretches out, bleak, icy, and unforgiving.

    <desc>This rocky ledge is ten feet wide and roughly three feet underwater.  It 
runs north and south, paralleling a high, faceted cliff, located to the 
west.  The crumbling, vertical wall periodically drops umber chunks of 
stone, ranging in size from pebbles to rocks the size of a man's head.  
These fallen pieces give the ledge an uneven, scree-like surface that shifts 
constantly underfoot.  The powerful waves, rolling in from the open ocean to 
the east, slam the rocks against the underwater rock-face with 
ankle-breaking force.  The muted rattle of these underwater impacts adds a 
descant to the crashing song of the breaking waves.

    <desc>The choppy waves cover this rocky shelf to a depth of two feet.  To the 
west, a craggy cliff claws at the sky; the dark form of Azkaban Prison 
perched, vulture-like, at the top.  Wedged between two sienna outcroppings, 
about halfway up, is a dark, rounded object, the size of two cupped hands.  
Below the waterline, the rock ridge is as jagged as the vertical face 
stretching up.  Though travel is possible to the north and south, the 
footing is treacherous, the passage made more difficult by the constant 
pounding of the waves.  To the east lies nothing but more waves.

      <desc>This russet-brown curve is the bottom of a bird's nest, formed primarily of 
seaweed, ingeniously wrapped and tucked.  The endless salt spray has given

of golden human hair.

    <desc>The rock-face to the west is composed of jutting boulders stacked together, 
like a dry-stone wall created by a giant mason.  Looming at the top is the 
dark wall of Azkaban Prison, its gloomy form shadowy through the salt spray. 
 Breakers crash against the base of the cliff, swamping the thin ledge that 
serves as a trail in a foot of bone-chilling brine.  The vivid-green, 
slime-coated algae that cling to the ledge makes travel difficult, but still 
possible to the north and south.  To the east is the endless, choppy surface 
of the rolling sea.

    <desc>Chilly surf washes ankle-deep over this rocky shelf, tucked against the base 
of a high cliff.  Far overhead, atop the escarpment to the west, looms a 
dark fortress: Azkaban Prison.  The crackled, brown surface of the rock-face 
is as fragile as an old, sepia-toned photograph, flaking at the slightest 
touch.  Even the wind from the east, off the sea, shakes tiny shards of 
stone and drifts of stinging grit free of the vertical surface.  The ledge, 
leading north and south, consists of uneven, crumbling rock two feet wide, 
dropping off on the eastern side to boulder-studded water ten feet deep.

towering up to the west.  High above, crouched malevolently atop the cliff,

      <desc>A lopsided nest, woven painstakingly from small, flexible sticks and strands 
of dark brown human hair, is cradled just inside this dark cleft in the 
rock.  On close examination, the pale twigs supporting it are actually the 
bones of a skeletal human hand, with decomposing sinews still clinging to 
the phalanges.  In the deeper recesses of the crevice, the curving dome of a 
skull is visible.  Too large to pass through to the open air, the smooth 
ivory cranium is entombed within the cliff.

    <desc>A high cliff, riddled with crumbling protrusions and small, unstable holes, 
dominates the west.  To the north, south, and east, the restless surface of 
the ocean stretches, chilly and uncaring, to the horizon.  At the top of the 
cliff stands the dark wall of Azkaban Prison, as indifferent and unwelcoming 
as the icy waves.  The scent of salt spray almost covers the charnel-house 
stench drifting down from above.  Below the waterline, the North Sea swirls 
in and out of smooth openings in the rock, alternately dragging flotsam 
towards the cliff and pushing it away.  The submerged, rocky ledge allowing 
passage to the north and south has been polished by countless grains of sand 
endlessly scrubbed over the surface by the relentless sea.

    <desc>The eroded corner of a cliff stands tall to the southwest, ragged, 
wind-carved hooks and hollows of stone blending with the smoother, 
water-shaped features closer to sea level.  Atop the island hunkers the 
gloomy shape of Azkaban Prison; the dark, grey walls are a sharp contrast to 
the patchy tan and taupe of the natural rock.  The escarpment stretches off 
to the south and west, allowing travel along the base to those willing to 
slog through the unpleasantly cold waves of the North Sea.  Here at the 
cliff base runs a steady current that threatens to sweep out to sea anything 
dislodged by the battering waves.  Beneath the choppy surface, shadowy 
objects are dragged along by the flow, swift and deadly as spears.  The 
wind, likewise, scours anything exposed to the air, carrying with it the 
sharp, tangy scent of the sea and the biting sting of salt spray flung with 
mindless vigour.

    <desc>A southern, vertical face of rippled, umber rock extends upwards, almost to 
the limit of vision.  Perched at the top is a darker mass: Azkaban Prison.  
Here, at the base, knee-deep seawater ebbs to a few inches and surges to 
nearly six feet deep as the waves beat against the stone.  Their unending 
crusade against the resolute stone has borne fruit; a shallow trough of rock 
is worn away, undercutting the cliff to a height of two feet.  The rocky 
seafloor is thickly coated with vivid-green slime that clings to anything it 
touches.  To the north, the ocean extends as far as the eye can see, 
hungrily seething against the sky.  Along the cliff base, the slick rock 
allows passage to the east and west.

    <desc>Running east and west, a ledge of slippery stone borders the base of a high 
cliff of rippled, brown stone.  Reaching upwards with worn ribs of stone, 
the southern rock face mocks would-be climbers with its lack of footholds.  
The restless surface of the sea stretches off to the north; beneath the 
waves, a forest of raw-umber seaweed sways with the motion of the brine.  
Wide blades of slick, marine vegetation whisk across the submerged ledge 
with each surging wave.

    <editdraftcomments>Hehe, I like how you said the fronds don't lightly open their secrets :) 
very nice.  No corrections from me here.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Echo number 0 should be: 'A finger-long fish darts through the kelp, pausing at a smooth, ashen dome half hidden by the waving strands.'
 
Comments: I took out the comma after 'dome', because with it, the sentence seemed to have referred to the fish and not the dome. In case you DO mean the fish and not the dome, I think it is better to write it as: A finger-long fish half-hidden by the waving strands darts through the kelp, pausing at a smooth, ashen dome.

      <desc>Careful observation of the seaweed bed reveals pallid objects tangled in the 
kelp, suspended ten feet below the surface.  One appears to be a bleached 
branch, the main stem split, the spread end bearing a shock of short twigs.  
Another looks like a large eggshell, trapped by a reddish-brown stalk of 
seaweed threaded through a pair of symmetrical holes on one side of the orb.

    <desc>The submerged strand of rock that serves as a path to the east and west is 
dotted with flat lobes of green-brown seaweed that grasps at any passer-by 
with clammy, slippery fingers.  Where the water deepens, to the north, long 
strands of kelp reach up from the dark depths, dancing languidly to some 
unheard, submarine music.  Irregular patches of ragged flotsam toss on the 
waves.  The south is dominated by a brown, pleated cliff, shallow cracks 
barely visible in the shadowy recesses of the folded rock.  Azkaban Prison 
broods darkly at the top of the escarpment.

    <desc>Pleats of amber stone stretch diagonally up the high cliff to the south.  In 
the furrows, finger-sized cracks lure climbers with promises of footholds, 
but their crumbling edges hint at treachery.  Far above, atop the sheer 
face, crouches a darker structure crouches: Azkaban Prison.  To the east and 
west, a narrow, sunken ledge skirts the base of the cliff; concealed beneath 
waist-deep water and a mat of sharp-edged seaweed a hand-span thick, the 
rocky path is cracked and untrustworthy.  This dangerous, weed-covered shelf 
is the only option for a foot-traveller; to the north, there is nothing but 
restive waves as far as the eye can see.

    <desc>The endless, shifting surface of the ocean stretches north to the horizon.  
Scattered bits of flotsam in the foam-flecked waves act as ever-changing 
frames of reference, scrambling instinctive attempts to estimate distance 
and direction.  Deep clefts mark the towering cliff to the south, the 
friable rock fragmenting under the least pressure.  High above, a dark mass 
glowers out from its perch at the top of the escarpment: Azkaban Prison.  
Between the forbidding cliff and the uncaring sea, a submerged shelf of 
weed-covered rock leads east and west.

tiny shards and sandy dust, shed by the exposed cliff face above.  Some of 
these fragments are barnacle-sharp, others are merely gritty.  All shift 
deceitfully underfoot.  Solid rock is covered in underwater life that 
prefers firm anchoring points: mussels, bladder wrack, and anemones.

    <desc>A crack in the base of the southern cliff face has been carved out into a 
shallow cave by the endless pounding of the sea.  The grey water stretching 
out to the northern horizon seems to focus all its fury on this one spot; 
the force of the waves is channelled into the hollow, each surge sending a 
scouring wash of icy water up the cave walls and shooting foamy plumes well 
over head-high.  A ledge, providing passage east and west, is almost washed 
away at this point from the relentless grinding of the grit-laden water.  
All seaweed, from the short stems of bladder wrack occupying the sunken 
shelf to the long, grasping kelp in the deeper water, reach longingly to the 
cave, drawn by the rushing current, only to turn away with the ebbing waves.

      <desc>Six feet deep and twice as tall, this cave has smooth-sculpted walls.  The 
floor bears an accumulation of grit and small stones, all in constant motion 
from the water.  As the waves rush in, this debris becomes underwater 
shrapnel; a few victims, battered and bloodied fish with scales blasted off 
by water-flung sand, float belly-up in the embrace of the hollow.  The 
water's surface is thick with scummy, mud-brown foam hiding what lies 
beneath.

    <desc>Long, diagonal rents, like the marks of giant claws, scar the cliff face to 
the south.  The brittle, umber rock stretches high overhead to the dark 
solidity of Azkaban Prison.  Waves sweep sharp fragments from the fractured 
stone back and forth over the submerged ledge that allows one to move east 
and west along the cliff's base.  Jagged as shrapnel and whipped by the 
power of the sea, the rubble beneath the surface shreds seaweed and unwary 
creatures alike.  To the north, the variegated grey of the sea fidgets and 
shifts as far as the eye can see.  The air is thick with spray and the scent 
of decomposing sea life.

From tiny, sharp-edged grains of sand to flat, razor-edged flakes of stone 
the size of a man's palm, the relentless water whips the loose rocks across

their sturdy shells.

The Ed of stones is changed.
 
 
^^ dunno who that's from as there's no 2nd edit draft or comments... anyway, these look great to me. `-mira

    <editfirst>Submerged rocks act as stepping stones through the churning waters of the 
North Sea; travel to the north and south is possible on these jagged 
(rocks).  To the east, a rock face, pockmarked by erosion, stretches high 
into the sky.  Atop the cliff, the squat, shadowy form of Azkaban Prison 
keeps ominous vigil.  The restless waves extend out to the western horizon, 
the grey of the ocean's surface broken only by flecks of foam and bobbing 
driftwood.

      <desc>. These irregular rocks, studded with sharp protrusions and adorned with 
knife-edged barnacles, serve a dual purpose; they are both home to a variety 
of marine life and a precarious pathway for any who wish to travel along the 
base of the cliff.  Mussels and bladder wrack hold fast to the stony 
surface, while minnows take shelter in tiny crevices.  In the recesses of 
one, deep crack, a tentacle-covered arm can be seen.

    <desc>The high sheet of rock to the east is as rippled as an umber velvet curtain; 
the crumbling surface visually resembles plush fabric, though to the touch 
it is more akin to sandpaper.  Atop the organic undulations of the cliff, a 
sharp-edged, dark mass is planted: Azkaban Prison.  At the base of the 
escarpment, scattered rocks just below the tossing waves provide a slick and 
precarious path to the north and south.  The blowing spray and silver mist 
covering the expanse of the ocean looks like tattered, grey lace stretching 
off to meet the western sky.

      <desc>These sunken stepping stones would be difficult to negotiate on dry land.  
Some jut directly and securely from the bedrock below, but others are simply 
stacked over other irregular stones, cushioned and anchored only by a slimy 
proliferation of sea weed and an encrustation of barnacles.

    <desc>The ocean extends to the western horizon.  The ceaseless wind whips the 
water into churning upheaval and the waves fling up briny spray in their 
defence.  The eroded cliff face to the east is collateral damage in the 
clash between the angry sea and the blustery weather; the rock surface shows 
battle scars both old and new.  Huddling at the base of the battered island, 
crouched two feet beneath the waves, a ridge of broken rock leads north and 
south.  A sure-footed traveller willing to brave the elemental conflict 
could scramble along this sunken path in either direction.

    <desc>Spread out in an uninterrupted vista to the west, the choppy surface of the 
North Sea shifts and fidgets in mutating shades of grey.  The constantly 
twisting winds whip the restless surface to snow-tipped peaks, but these 
soon sink back into the roiling mass.  Stretching high above the water 
level, the cliff face to the east bears undulating striations that mimic the 
ocean's swells in the mottled sienna of an old snapshot.  Below the water's 
surface, a ledge of the same, wrinkled rock acts as a pathway leading north 
and south.

    <desc>Folded, crumbling rock stretches up from the water, an unassailable eastern 
facade that contains thousands of treacherously-weak footholds, ready to 
disintegrate at the slightest touch.  Here and there, seabirds have braved 
the deceitful stone, tucking nests in the deepest of the crevices.  At the 
waterline, the relentless action of the waves washed away the unstable 
formations, leaving deep, irregular, submarine caves; most are too small to 
admit a man's head.  Below the waves, worn ragged by the pounding surf, a 
thin ledge allows passage to the north and south.  To the west is nothing 
but lonely sea and wind as sharp as a whetted knife.

    <desc>Mottled, grey-green water, flecked with grungy foam and floating fragments 
of seaweed, extends to the west as far as the eye can see.  The ocean 
mutters constantly to itself, a liquid susurration that can rise to a roar 
in the time it takes to snap one's fingers.  To the east, a silent cliff 
absorbs the continuous sound, echoing it back even as it reflects the 
caresses of the restless waves.  High atop the escarpment squats the dark 
form of Azkaban Prison, listening to the whispers of the sea and the wailing 
of the wind.  Stretching north and south along the base of the cliff, hidden 
below the waves, protected by the sheltering rock runs a thread of a 
pathway.

    <desc>A fractured, eastern cliff face stretches to the shadowy bulk of Azkaban 
Prison high above.  The fragmented, umber rock offers no purchase for hand 
nor foot, only cutting edges and sandpaper-rough surfaces.  Heaps of shed 
scree line the base of the escarpment, offering a shifting, slime-covered 
path to the north and south, through ankle-deep brine.  To the west, 
splintered waters extend to the horizon; the waves reflect light at 
ever-changing angles, like a seething sheet of shattered glass.

    <desc>This section of the North Sea is unusually calm.  A pristine stretch of 
glassy, deep-blue water reaches out a distance to the north and south,
like a softly-throbbing, rolling plain.  The sea itself is crystal clear,
and one can see nearly all the way to the deep, dark bottom.  The sea would 
be calming, if not for the occasional, porcelain-pale body part
floating by.  A grim, low light illuminates the ebb and flow of the sea.  
The smell of salty air hovers above the serene water, slightly tinged with 
the stench of raw meat.  A subtle churning sound can be heard, if one is 
just quiet enough.

on its palm as the churning of the sea makes its little fingers flex.

    <desc>A sky-scraping cliff blocks the view to the east; high atop the escarpment 
squats the squalid form of Azkaban Prison.  Not even the brisk, chilly 
breeze, scented with the salty tang of the sea, can cover the heavy stench 
of blood, fear, and decay drifting down from above.  To the west, the queasy 
ocean shifts restlessly under the onslaught of prison reek, the nauseous 
waves extending to the horizon.  The breakers clutch unsteadily at broken, 
half-submerged rocks; the foamy fingers of brine are torn away again and 
again, but a foot traveller could manage to move north or south along the 
sodden and precarious trail.

    <desc>The menacing form of Azkaban Prison looms high in the east, guarding this 
North Sea island like a Dementor hovering over its prey.  Between the 
treacherous path and the prison lies a weathered sea wall riddled with 
razor-sharp outcroppings; any attempt to climb it would be both futile and 
painful.  Rolling in from the west, the waves crash against the path 
relentlessly, endlessly stirring the driftwood and seaweed strewn across the 
rocks.  To the north, the path continues to follow the sea wall along the 
edge of the island.  The southern shore can be glimpsed through the salty 
mist to the south, where the path also continues.

    <desc>The western and southern shores meet here, at the corner of the island, 
where crashing waves have hewn the rock edges into a labyrinth of 
razor-sharp outcroppings.  Such deadly protrusions not only help to keep the 
Azkaban prisoners trapped on the island; they also keep everyone else out.  
The castle dominates the north sky, unforgiving and unyielding against the 
endless ocean waves.  The waves continue to pour in from the west and south, 
further sharpening the treacherous rocks that compose the path.  The trail 
can be seen continuing to the north, where it perilously clings to the cliff 
side, and to the east, where an intersection is faintly silhouetted against 
the mist.

      <desc>Jutting out in every direction, the rocks that make up the seaside path bear 
a grave reminder of the perilous nature of this North Sea island.  The 
razor-sharp edges of the rocks glitter in the ocean spray like the claws of 
a Hungarian Horntail.  Climbing down into the ocean would be agonizing, if 
not altogether impossible, due to the eroded rocks.  The same could be said 
about climbing the cliff to the northeast.

    <desc>The temperature is quite cool in this room.  However, frost motifs, 
apparently carved out by sheer natural erosion, creep along the 
frozen-white, stone walls, ceiling, floor, and a central column.  Silvery 
doors open to the north and south into cells; another, eastern exit leads to 
another stairwell.  The stair revolving around the column only goes up, not 
down.  The steps are moulded out of the same silvery, metal as the doors: 
this matter is painfully-glacial to the touch and gives of a constant, 
albeit faint luminescence.  The railing hangs about three feet up in the 
air, without poles to support it; moreover, it is made of a mercury-like, 
seemingly-liquid, icy-teal metal.  More of the said metal lines the steps.

    <editdraftcomments>Dearest Carole, this room is wonderful, but it misses some lighting. Please add that, and make the little tweaks I recommended, and all should be golden. Much love, Cris
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please change 'as' to 'like that' in echo number [2].
 
2) Please interchange 'wheezes' and 'distressingly' in echo number [4].
 
Otherwise, these echoes are awesome, and I love them! Much love, Cris

      <desc>The doors, and particularly their handles, are made of such a 
pain-inflicting material as to discourage, or at least slow down, escape.  
Small cat flaps allow the jailer to pass meals in without being hurt.  The 
metal also serves as the only source of light in the room, its almost bluish 
hue and faint luminescence further enforcing the feeling of a cold, 
full-mooned night over a dead moor.

      <desc>The stone making up the walls, ceiling, and floor of this cell looks like 
white sandstone covered in frost.  Touching it is like passing your hand 
over a million sharp, icy needles, and a simple graze leaves the flesh raw 
and red, bringing about the only hint of true colour in this dead space.

      <desc>The slightly greenish hue of this liquid metal is about the only discordance 
in the overall bluish-white environment.  However, the surface is as 
treacherous and dangerous as the rest of the room, the liquid burning with 
coldness.

    <desc>The rounded walls of this cell, combined with the cathedral ceiling, make it 
seem as if it will go on forever. The floor - made of stone blocks - matches 
the walls and the ceiling perfectly. There is a sunken, filthy mattress in 
the room and a bowl lay on the floor. A single, lonely torch burns dimly 
barely illuminating the grey floor. The only escape from this infinite hell 
is south, to a stairwell.

      <desc>The walls of this circular cell are made of large, stone blocks. Stacked neatly, there are no carvings of any sort on them save for a single word written in minuscule handwriting: &quot;death&quot;. Clearly the last wish of an occupant of the cell, the word is only visible on close inspection. The dry and dusty stones are packed together just loosely enough so that an experienced climber could scale their height.

    <desc>.    The smell of rotting flesh coats the air in this small cell. Ivy-covered 
walls curve smoothly in large, horizontal arcs. A single candle floats in 
the centre of the room, nearly touching the ceiling, and throws a dim light 
upon the cracked, grimy floor. No windows are found here; instead only a 
tiny door serves as an escape. A small, barely-visible puddle has formed in 
front of the wooden door that leads north to an upward stairwell.

    <desc>This stifling, cacophonous chamber resonates with the continuous sounds of 
hissing, crackling flames.  Roughly twelve feet across, the sandstone 
enclosure is bathed in a lurid, crimson glow, emanating from several round 
holes pierced into the rock.  The walls, ceiling, and even the solid, stone 
door to the south seem to be heated somehow, as if the cell were surrounded 
by an inferno.  The floor is covered in what appears to be ash and charred 
cloth, marked by the smeared footprints of previous inhabitants.  A smooth 
hollow in the centre, slightly cooler than the surrounding area, serves as a 
sleeping area.  The air beyond the bed is almost hot enough to scorch flesh. 
 A painstakingly-daubed edict blights one wall, the jagged, ashen letters 
read: &quot;Oh dead bell, ring!&quot;

Wooden beams stretch twenty feet from ceiling to floor, giving the room a 
pinstriped feel. Wispy smoke, like that of a cigarette, has been enchanted 
to form thin bars which crisscross the ceiling. The dark, stone walls are 
wet with boiling water. A titanium, circular door opens north to a downward

 A large window, sitting on the western wall, is the only source of light.  
Small shadows peak under the teal-coloured metal railing.  The dark ceiling 
is barely visible through the opaque shadows.  There is no dirt or grime of

are strewn with cracks and large chunks of stone are missing.  Grime covers 
the walls and the little parts that are clearly visible are damp with hot 
water.  Six, broken, metal brackets are each home to a barely-lit torch.  A 
shadow of the railing is thrown upon the ground as the stairwell moves 
upward.  Two, tiger-wood doors lead north and south respectively, to cells.  
A metal barred door leads east to a downward stairwell.

    <desc>The walls of this hellish cell are coated in a dim light which radiates from 
a single, everlasting candle.  The candle sits awkwardly on a small stool, 
its wax slowly melting over the wooden surface.  Two beds are present in the 
room; each of them no more than a beaten mattress.  Under the beds lies a 
cold, hard floor which is slightly wet and made of small, stone blocks that 
are streaked with moss.  The four, smooth walls are nothing more than 
stacked rocks.  A gruesome, green mould grows from the place where the 
ceiling meets the walls and a strong smell of burned food emanates through 
the place.  An iron-clad door leads south, to an upward stairwell.

      <desc>Two, filthy mattresses lay next to each other on the floor. Stuffing hangs 
limply out of holes in the dark-brown mess, and small bugs feast on the 
stray bits of hay and cotton. Teeth marks are spread randomly over the 
fabric, and the corners appears to have been chewed off.

    <desc>.  Perfectly smooth, stone walls slope inward so that the floor of this cell 
is twice the size of its ceiling. Serving as the only light in the room, 
three torches produce a dazzling, white light. An array of galleons floats a 
taunting, twelve feet off the ground. Spinning lethargically, they reflect 
the white glow of the torches. A careless layer of dust and grime has 
accumulated on the ground. A large pile of bug-ridden hay lies in the centre 
of the chamber so that whoever occupied the makeshift bed could watch the 
money greedily. A small, brass door leads north to an upward stairwell.

    <desc>An occult, purple glow issues from the fireplace of this cell. The 
eight-foot ceiling is all most completely covered in nonsensical words. 
Stone slabs serve as walls for the small cell, and stone blocks makeup the 
floor. There are three torches which glow brightly, though like the 
fireplace they, too, have a purple flame in them. A small pile of straw is 
meant to be a bed for the captive in this cell. A small, glass cup sits in a 
corner of the room. The large, metal barred door leads south to a stairwell.

      <desc>Surrounding the fireplace and each of the torches is a metal cage. Glowing 
from behind their barriers, the flames cackle and glow as if they were a 
regular fire. Upon close inspection it is clear the flames are omitting some 
sort of faint mist, though it is impossible to detect exactly what the mist 
may do.

    <desc>A thick, warm liquid - present on the walls of this abominable cell - 
produces a bland, hardly noticeable odour like tree sap. A substance like 
yellow glitter sparkles beautifully off the rocky ground. A single, 
enchanted candle floats idly in the centre of the room, immersing the 
rectangular walls in an orange glow. Black, metal bars cover the faces of 
the two windows that serve as the only decoration in the room. Frost has 
formed on the handle of a wooden door, and small icicles hang lethally from 
the pointed ceiling. In the eighty-degree angle, where the walls meet the 
ground, bits of frost and ice have formed. A wooden, metal-barred door leads 
northward to a downward stairwell.

emits the smell of vanilla that wafts through the cell.

    <desc>A cold draft ripples through the air from the top of the damp stairwell.  
The sea just beyond the stairs batters the stone with the wrath of an angry 
Hippogriff.  The smell of salt permeates the air as the walls tremble and 
bits of moisture spray into the dark enclosure at each rhythmic thud.  The 
soft rumbling echoes down the north exit, disappearing into the unknown.  
Small salt crystals shimmer in the corners of the low ceiling.  A trickle of 
water falls down the steps in an even stream, rippling along the rough stone 
surface rolling towards the slanted south exit.  Two salt encrusted sconces 
are imbedded in the rough gray wall.  Narrow in depth, the slippery stairs 
lead up towards the sound of crashing water.

</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Sentence one: &quot;Bricks of stone&quot; is passive voice, generally speaking we also 
write in the active voice, so it should be &quot;stone bricks&quot;.  However, as this 
is an opening sentence and it is so short, I will give you literary license 
to let it stay if you think it sounds better this way.  Sentence 3: What 
rock?  What do the scratches look like?  What type of atmosphere do they 
emanate (foreboding, torturous, creepy, etc)?  Why are there scratch marks?  
Because someone was dragged to an undeserving fate, or because they were 
desperately trying to escape, whilst being whisked away into their most 
tormental nightmare?  Be descriptive.  This is Azkaban.  It should be creepy 
as hell, add some flair.  Sentence 6: You say &quot;cells can be seen&quot; as though 
you're bird watching on a picnic.  Being sent here is the worst fate a 
wizard can get, make it sound that way!  &quot;The rattling doors leading to the 
hollow caves of Caedes Turris cells are barely distinguishable through the 
opaque darkness of the area.&quot;  &quot;Misery hangs like thick syrup in the still 
air.&quot;  Etc, etc.  I'm pushing you for more because I know you can do better. 
 You have the grammar down perfectly, now strive for perfection in the 
content.  Xoxo Jess

    <editeds>No EDs and no echoes?  Kyle, people should be screaming out in pain, being 
driven mad by their hellish rooms, trying to get away, being dragged into 
cells.  The guards should be stunning and hexing people left and right to 
get them in here.  I think you can come up with * something *.

    <desc>Huge, stone blocks make up the walls of this cell.  There has clearly been 
no attempt at levelling the rough, jagged sides of the penitentiary and thus 
climbing the wall would be only too easy.  Three torches lie in their 
brackets, glowing apathetically, burning with desire, flickering with 
despair.  Pieces of straw are clumped together to form a would-be bed, a 
kind gesture in a room of sorrow.  The straw is dented in the centre, as 
though something had fallen on it, and blood specks are visible on its 
mundane surface.  No windows allow a view of the world outside, though some 
metal bars serve as a door and between them, in the south, an upward 
stairwell is visible.

so that the grey stone underneath is no longer visible.  Hundreds of thorn 
bushes grow from the floor, covering the dirt-ridden ground.  The continual 
sounds of crickets chirping, wolves howling, and animals scurrying play like 
a miserable melody through the humid air.  A small patch of rock-strewn 
grass lies in the centre of the room.  A short chain connects to the middle 
of the island, a shackle on the other end to ensure the prisoner does not 
wander.  The cell is never completely dark, but there are no visible means 
of light.  A tiny, wooden door leads south to a downward stairwell.

    <desc>This cell is baleful, dank, and arctic.  Only a single ray of light forces 
itself through the thick darkness which has enveloped the cell.  The light 
comes from a tiny, rectangular window, cut very crudely into the solid, oak, 
door.  The rectangular light pierces the room, resting on a spot two feet 
above what appears to be some kind of bed.  The light reveals tick marks 
left by a former prisoner.  The tick marks have a tiny inscription under 
them.  The floors, and walls are all made of dull, wet, moss-covered 
granite.  The bed is only a board held up by a rusty chain on each side; it 
looks as if it had not been used in a long time.  The only way out of this 
room is unfortunately, the only way in, to the north.

    <desc>Levitating in the direct centre of this cell, a clear sheet of enchanted 
glass dances ten feet from the cracked, cement ground.  Eight feet long and 
four feet across, the plank is a tantalizing twenty feet from the dry, 
crumbling ceiling.  Forming a colossal, thirty-foot radius around the 
agonizing bed, a diverse array of metal spikes protrude from the unbudging 
ground.  Glinting in the dim, somehow spotlight-like torches, the spikes 
offer a dishonorable death to a disgraced captive.  A small door has been 
rusted through so thoroughly even the slightest application of force would 
tear it from its glass hinges.  The silence of the room is deafening, and 
the suppressed aggression of previous occupants lethargically drips through 
the air, soaking the walls, floor, and ceiling in an unbearable dosage of 
suffering.

the dark.  The low hung lanterns droop over from the brackets casting long 
eerie shadows over the walls.  The walls have crevices here and there 
through which water drips occasionally making the bare floor steps wet and 
muddy.  Two prison cells lie to the north and the south.  Their doors are 
elaborately decorated with runes for the frame.  The doors dcor itself 
symbolizes complete luxury and importance to the inhabitants within.  Both 
the doors have knockers shaped like a griffins head.  An eastern stairwell

    <desc>Flickering, azure flames burn in sconces lining the jet-black walls of this 
stairwell.  They disperse a dim, steel-blue luminance, staining the inky 
shadows of the area a tinge of navy.  The distant sound of crashing waves 
and a slight, salty scent derive from a narrow opening cut high in the far, 
eastern wall which is bolted with metal bars.  The cramped, minuscule hole 
is barely a window, but, like a ray of hope, a smidgen of light manages to 
stalk through, waging a war against the oppressive darkness.  A large, 
sturdy, driftwood door stands imposingly to the south, and, sticking out 
like a sore thumb, an odd-green door is planted amongst the northern 
murkiness.  Cramped in the corner, a tapering stairway with grey, stone 
steps leads to the upper floor, obscured by the gloom that hangs in the air. 
 To the west, a flight of slippery stairs leads downwards, into the bowels 
of the earth.

this stairwell.  They disperse a dim, steel blue luminance, staining the 
inky shadows of the area a shade of navy.  The distant sound of crashing 
waves and a slight salty scent derives from a narrow opening that has been 
cut high in the far eastern wall and bolted with metal bars.  It is barely a 
window due to its lowly size but still, like a ray of hope, a smidgen of 
light manages to stalk through, waging a war against the oppressive 
darkness.  Along a thin corridor, a sturdy, driftwood door stands upright to 
the south and in the northward passageway, among the murkiness, an odd green 
door sticks out like a sore thumb.  Cramped in the corner, a tapering 
stairway with grey stone steps leads to the upper floor, obscured by the 
gloom that hangs in the air.  To the west, through the duskiness, more cells 
are revealed along with stairs that go downwards.

    <editdraftcomments>Dear Grace, your writing, as in your application, is very, very good! I like your fluency and power of expression, and I like the way none of the elements you present in the room are obtrusive or sharp! Well done!
 
What I edited at your room are a few grammatical issues - commas mostly, and a few content-related stuff. I've added a couple of sharper adjectives, like &quot;cramped&quot;, &quot;hole&quot;, etc, which would, I think, enhance the great atmosphere you've got going. Also, and this is very important: you've added all the exits, which is great - it's exactly what we need. However, when you added the northern exit in particular, you also mention a corridor. The players will be confused that they bump into a solid wall rather than in a corridor if they start to go north. When azkaban is put into play, that door will probably be locked, so they need some small incentive to think of unlocking it. 
 
Regarding the style of the edits - I've added () around one of the edits. This means that it's only a suggestion for a rephrase. You may wish to keep it that way; in that case, please copy and paste the text of the edited text (without the parantheses) to the desc. However, if you wish to rephrase it differently, please change the sentence to your wish and place the new text in the first edit comments - by typing comment first. Also, if you have done so, please let me know in your note, and I'll come see it again.
 
Thank you SO much for writing for us, and I love your style of writing. Keep them coming, love! `-Cristina

    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
Dear Grace, your echoes are beautiful and expressive; however, echoes [0] and [2] are a bit on the long side. I will suggest below a few ways of shortening them. These are suggestions though, so please feel free to make your own changes - only in that case, please let me know about them.
 
1) Echo number [0] to: &quot;A bead of water slides off the window ledge, merging with the shallow puddle on the granite floor below; the splash ripples in the surrounding stillness.&quot;
 
2) Echo number [2] to: &quot;As a howling sea-breeze explodes through the gaps in the barred window, the electric-blue flames of many sconces flicker morosely.&quot;
 
Additionally, I have edited your ED and I've taken out one phrase of it, since it regards daylight. This ED stays here throughout the day, however, so we need to always make sure we specify that there is no light during a (magical or normal) period of darkness. The best way to have that in, I think, is to make it an echo out of it, and this is my suggestion for it:
 
 
3) addecho 9 17 2 Cut shards of light pierce through the minuscule window gaps, trickling like balm against the cold, grey darkness of the stairwell.
 
EDS:
 
I've edited your ed, as mentioned before. I thought your last sentence was slightly unclear as to where the pool was (on every step, at one particular point of the staircase etc) and to how this pool is even visible in such a dark place.
 
Your room was great, and I loved the unobtrusive grace with which you work - guess it's kind of a name trademark :P Thank you so much for your efforts, and keep at it! `-Cristina

    <editfirst>Flickering, azure flames burn in sconces lining the jet-black walls of this 
stairwell.  They disperse a dim, steel-blue luminance, staining the inky 
shadows of the area a tinge of navy.  The distant sound of crashing waves 
and a slight, salty scent derive from a narrow opening cut high in the far, 
eastern wall and bolted with metal bars.  The cramped, minuscule hole is 
barely a window, but, like a ray of hope, a smidgen of light manages to 
stalk through, waging a war against the oppressive darkness.  (Along a thin 
corridor, a sturdy, driftwood door stands to the south; among surrounding 
murkiness, an odd green door sticks out like a sore thumb to the north.)  
Cramped in the corner, a tapering stairway with grey, stone steps leads to 
the upper floor, obscured by the gloom that hangs in the air.  To the west, 
a flight of slippery stairs leads downwards, into the bowels of the earth.  
</editfirst>
    <editfirstcomments>I decided to scrap the corridor all together it's easier that way and makes 
more sense.  So here is the edited sentence with no corridor: Southwards, a 
large, sturdy driftwood door stands imposing, and, among the murkiness, an 
odd green door sticks out in contrast like a sore thumb to the north.

      <desc>The window is merely a crude, narrow, oblong shape cut in the wall.  Perhaps 
to keep inmates from escaping, its tenuous mould is spiked with metal bars 
and placed high upon the wall, although a fleeting glimpse of sky still 
emerges beyond the gaps.  Like the rumble of an angry, restless monster, the 
sound of waves crashing violently against rocks permeates the darkness.  A 
pool of cold water stagnates many feet down, invisible but for reflections 
from the flaming sconces; it is a bitter reminder of how tantalisingly 
close, yet far away the room is from the outside world.

    <desc>Pink, orange, and blue stripes line the walls of this cell.  A silver 
chandelier hangs from the ceiling, immersing the room in a childish, pink 
glow.  The continual melody of a carnival ride plays through the air.  Three 
signs hang from the walls, the words &quot;tickets&quot;, &quot;cotton candy&quot;, and &quot;free&quot; 
are written, respectively, on each sign in a flashing, neon light.  The 
smell of fried dough lingers throughout the room, touching everything.  The 
spotless, white floor seems to reflect the insanity of its surroundings.  A 
distorted mirror leans against a wall.  A shirt, lime-green door leads south 
to an upward stairwell.

    <desc>The walls of this stark, rectangular cell are made of thick blocks of 
granite.  A large chunk has been hewn out of one wall to form a bedding 
area.  Scribbles of past prisoners are drawn, carved, and painted upon every 
surface, even the impossibly-high ceiling.  The ground is composed of 
broken, faded, painted tiles, many with the initials of previous inmates 
inscribed upon them.  A single window leads to the outside, barred by 
vertical, black poles.  Smells of fish and sounds of a breaking tide enter 
from beyond.  The singular exit is to the north, in the form of a sturdy, 
driftwood door.

The poles appear to have been scraped at and cut into at various points along their length. A faint, glittering sheen of silver filings litters the area below the window.

      <desc>Huge scenes of carved writing embellish the walls, the ceiling, and the oak door. Tales of false imprisonment, death threats, and ethics on selling defective cauldrons are cut into the surface, forming various shapes, like clouds on a stormy day. Several of the longer etchings have been magically burnt away and, in the particular case of a list of grievances, only numbers remain. The rest of the surface is no more than a blackened, blasted ruin of cracked slabs and loose rocks.

    <desc>Perfectly flat walls curve smoothly into the jagged floor. Sharp pieces of 
rock stick out at angles, threatening injury to anything that may come into 
forced contact with it. The vaulted ceiling is laced with a sickly, green 
grime. Torches adorn the walls at random positions, so that half the room is 
much brighter than the other. A small, metal-barred window sits eight feet 
from the cold, stone floor. A thick, polished, wooden door leads south to a 
downward stairwell.

    <desc>.  Hundreds of traces of white stars litter the walls of this cell. Glowing 
brightly, they serve as the only light in the room. The rough, stone floor 
is moist and uncomfortable. A small pile of hay sits in the centre of the 
room and directly above it is a small hole in the ceiling, from which leak 
continual drops of water. There are no windows on any of the six-foot long, 
square walls. A heavy, oak door leads north to a downward stairwell.

    <desc>This cell is bleak, constricting like a tomb.  A morbid odour lingers in the 
gloom.  The sombre walls are bare but for the door, a slab of oak adorned 
with rusted thorns.  A chandelier, black with years of soot, casts stark and 
jagged shadows underfoot.  Carved into stone, the marks of those interred 
record the anguished souls that died unheard.

    <desc>. An enchated, glass barrier slices this cell into two, uneven sections: 
north and south, blessed and damned, want and need.  Twenty feet off the 
carpeted floor, a mural depicts a mother looking lovingly into the eyes of 
her son.  The intense passion of unconditional love radiates from the 
picture, immersing the setting below in a force-field of contented apathy.  
A covered, red sofa and two armchairs litter the shaggy, white carpet, 
blending beautifully with the dark-red walls.  The northern side of the 
glass, while only four-feet wide and eighteen-feet in length, is 
grime-covered and nauseating.  Thick patches of mould rise hazardly from 
cracks in the stone floor, twisting around jagged pieces of rock and 
spreading themselves over the face of the stone, as though presenting 
themselves for judgement.  A continual drip of water lands with a hardly 
audible splash in the western corner of the area.  There are no visible 
means of light, though the cell is never dark.  A large hand-print has been 
eroded into the glass a miserable two feet from the hardened, cruel ground, 
as though a prisoner had sat there for long periods of time, longing for the 
love which radiates through the opposite section.  A small, metal door 
unwillingly leads north, to a downward stairwell.

    <desc>A small barred window allows a small amount of dismal light to enter the 
cell.  This reveals the small well made bed and dank, grimy walls.  A dark 
stained door lies to the south, being the only exit of the room.  As silence 
consumes all in it's path, dripping water saves this room from silence as 
the small droplets of water continue to splash onto the dirty floor.  Stones 
and pebbles scatter the bare, damp floor as another leak springs to life and 
another puddle is formed against the wall, where a steady stream of downward 
water resides.

    <desc>A thick, heavy door lay to the north, being the only exit from here.  A 
small window allows the pathetic beam of sunlight to enter the room.  This 
small window breaks the thick wall allowing the sight range of outside and 
the great thickness of these walls.  Upon arrival, the door hinges screech 
in pain from age.  Pushed up against the west wall is a bed, beside the bed 
on the dark wall, which when new, gleamed, had an abundance of tallies.  The 
floor had puddles and cracks, the puddles would disappear into the cracks 
and find their way downward to the floor below, intent on making more 
puddles.  Dried blood stains various areas on the smooth and dirty floor and 
walls which cannot be washed away with any amount of water that drips down, 
or any amount of scrubbing which can be done.

    <desc>The stairwell lacks the smell of suffering and fear that is characteristic 
of this dreadful prison.  The floor, the east wall, and two, adjacent 
hallways are all made from smooth granite.  The stairs leading upward spiral 
unsupported.  The hand rail, also unsupported, spirals upward with the 
stairs.  To the north is a hallway, brightly lit with torches, leading to a 
door with light bursting around its edges and through its cracks.  To the 
south is a short hallway leading to a cell with light piercing from under 
its wooden door.  To the west, a hallway stretches to another set of stairs 
leading down.

    <desc>The customary gloominess of a prison cell seems to be lacking in this 
surprisingly-airy room.  Perhaps that is because of the large window in the 
eastern wall.  The window has no glass, allowing fresh air to come in, 
though iron bars still crisscross the opening.  The room itself is clean and 
well maintained; no debris litters the solid, dark, stone floor, which 
cleanly shines from a recent mopping.  The cot is just an ordinary cot, but 
the sheets on it are clean and thick, and a woolen blanket lies folded on 
top of it.  The air smells of a mixture of cleaning agents, fresh air from 
outside, and clean laundry.  Beside the heavy door that is the only exit 
from the room, a torch burns brightly, even in daylight.

      <desc>The floor and walls of the room are composed of a hard stone, so dark that 
it's nearly black.  The stone holds heat and cold well, so that it is hot to 
the touch on warm days and cold as ice in winter.  The stone is seamless and 
uncracked; no moisture, air, or sound escapes from it.

      <desc>The square window is three feet across, sitting high off the floor, with 
three iron bars crossing it each way.  On clear days, the gaps allow copious 
amounts of sunlight and moonlight to flood the room.  The dark stone of the 
room absorbs the heat of the sun, making is hot to the touch.  The window 
also allows the winds and rains to pound the chamber unhindered and the 
well-kept cell has no leaks, enabling it to easily flood.

      <desc>The woollen blanket is folded in quarters on top of the cot.  The blanket is 
only three feet square and extremely scratchy to the touch.  The sheets, 
though thick and warm, are equally scratchy and uncomfortable.  They are 
also slightly too small for the cot, so that a person would have a difficult 
time covering up with them.  A pillow is conspicuously absent from the cot.

    <desc>The floor, walls, and ceiling of this cell are clean, smooth, sturdy, and 
painted a dull shade of white.  The bed sits against the east wall where 
the only window in this cell is located.  The window lets air flow through 
this cell freely, allowing the normal stench of despair and suffering to 
dissipate into the wind.  The ceiling is flat.  The distance between the 
ceiling and the floor is twelve-feet.  The west wall holds a small 
blackboard.  The south wall has a small sink in the west corner and a toilet 
rests two feet east of it.  The exit out of the cell is blocked by a thick, 
oak door that leads north to a set of stairs.

    <desc>This high-ceilinged room is painted entirely a clinical, chipping white, as 
if someone had been trying to give a comforting feel to it but failed 
miserably.  The height of the ceiling easily reaches about 12 or 13 feet and 
is painted in some sort of luminous paint, which provides a cold light for 
the room.  There is nothing on the dry, bricked walls except for a lone, 
black and white photograph in a thin, grey frame.  A white, wooden desk 
dominates the centre of the room and a pale, swiveling chair perches, 
lopsided, behind it.  The stagnant, mixed scent of alcohol and disinfectant 
fills the air.  A thin, white, wooden door leads the way out, to the east.

    <editdraft>This room's landing is met by a staircase that ascends so steeply it would 
be better classified as a ladder.  The wide steps are stacked almost 
directly underneath each other, and the vertical distance between each is 
far enough to make climbing it a challenge, especially because there are no 
handrails to provide support.  The steps themselves are made out of rusted 
metal grating.  No expense has been spared in lighting this room; the only 
illumination comes from distant candles and magical lights.  However, these 
provide enough glow to show a gap between the ceiling and the wall through 
which water is flowing in a steady stream.  This crack has been 
significantly crusted over with salt dissolved in the water, which continues 
down to the invisible floor.  Several of Azkaban's cells are located to the 
east and southeast, while the dangerous staircase continues downward.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Chris, just 2 small things to do for me, here.  In your first sentence, 
please put a comma in after &quot;so steeply&quot;, and in the middle of your desc 
here you mention distant candles and magical lights, but you don't say where 
from.  Are they in the room, or from the hallway, somewhere in the prison, 
etc.  If you could just say where it's coming from, then you're golden on 
this room.  Don't worry about sending another draft notice to me, just go 
ahead and put it in :) thanks so much!

      <desc>This gap in the cement between the grey bricks of the wall and the spackle 
of the ceiling is wide enough to permit water to escape through, presumably 
from a leak in the plumbing.  The water has flowed through here long enough 
that the gap has been considerably narrowed by a crust of salt deposited by 
the stream.

    <desc>There is almost no illumination in the Vespertilio Turris stairwell, save 
for a few, sparse torches that provide little, if any, light.  A set of 
stairs, leading downwards, takes up most of the room.  The chamber is 
claustrophobically narrow, allowing only one person through at a time.  The 
harsh, red bricks of the chamber are smooth on the walls and floor, but 
jagged on the steps.  The air in the stairwell is stuffy and humid, with a 
lingering smell of raw meat.  There are two paths one could take: to the 
southeast and southwest are nearly identical passageways, each adorned with 
the same, dim torches.  Other than the two foreboding roads, the only other 
way out is down the brick staircase to the floor below.

    <desc>A horrible combination of sweat, waste, beast, and rot fills the 
unusually-wide staircase.  The smell hangs stagnant in the completely still 
air.  There is no breeze that fills this stairwell, no windows to show a 
hint of the outside world.  Halfway up the stairs, single torches on either 
side of the room provide the only light.  Dark, dank stones uniformly 
construct the walls and ceiling.  Each slab is smooth, but the crevices 
between slabs are jagged and several, small tufts of feather and fur are 
caught in them.  Along the edges of the room are more feathers and fur, 
kicked to the side rather than cleaned away.  Along the west wall is a 
heavy, metal door beside which a dark stain trails down to the floor.  To 
the southwest lies a corridor and the stairs, leading downward, fade away in 
the darkness.

      <desc>The stain is dark, but the colour is indistinguishable in the faint light.  
It has a metallic smell, suspiciously like blood.  It begins four feet off 
the ground, about a foot and a half wide.  The stain tapers as it trails 
down, until it is only a few inches wide when it hits the floor.  It traces 
a path down the top two steps before fading entirely.

      <desc>The door is much larger than a standard door, built to accommodate any kind 
of creature.  It is made of a dark, inflexible metal that reflects the 
flickering lights of the torches.  Four bars, each eight inches wide and 
made of a solid black, metal, are fastened across the door, silver keyholes 
gleaming in the centre of each.

    <editdraft>This elegant staircase speaks of a grandeur one would not normally associate 
with Azkaban.  The steps, both wide and broad, are mostly clean-swept, save 
for a few small pockets of dust and cobwebs in the corners.  The large 
ascending platforms seem to shine with a phosphorescent golden light, 
perhaps the reflection on the near-white wood of the steps of the glowing 
brass lamps mounted on the walls.  The balustrade is a dull mahogany 
accented by large strips of gleaming gold that run along both sides of the 
wood.  The railing is held by spun glass supports, with thick golden poles 
at certain intervals providing added support.  Beyond the staircase are damp 
walls of grey stone.  On the wall opposite the entrance to the stairs is a 
tarnished brass plaque, invisible in the dim room save for the protruding 
letters themselves, which read Aelati Turris.  Below is the room housing the 
staircase's entrance; above, the steps spiral up into darkness.  Five 
offices branch off north, east, west, southeast, and southwest.

    <editdraftcomments>I put in a few commas here, chris, but I think your room is quite good.  I'm 
always surprised by people who write in azkaban, because each room is so 
unique and different!  You would think a prison would be somewhat 
monotonous.

    <desc>This room is mostly one big staircase, spiralling from the ceiling and into 
the floor.  Even though an iron-wrought, knotworked parapet goes around the 
stair, the steps are only panels of similarly-wrought, knotworked, and very 
transparent iron.  Moreover, no panel stands up between the steps.  The 
vertigo is even more enhanced by the spiralling movement.  About up where 
the floor would be, the most northern and most southern panels are level and 
extend into a round, foot-wide circle.  The latter is also a dentelle of 
wrought iron and another railing of similarly fashion, raising up from it to 
about three-feet high.  Six doors line up the other side of this circle and 
lead away north, east, southeast, south, west, and northwest.

    <editdraftcomments>Carole, it's so good to see a room from you!  I've got 13 more of yours to 
edit, so yes, I'm sure your inbox will be lovely and full.  Anyway, just 1 
teeny question.  I checked in Word, and it didn't like your word, dentelle.  
Assuming you know what it means, because I know you're brilliant, if that 
word is meant to be, then you should be all set for this room.  :)

    <desc>This room is merely an elongated hexagon, the two longest sides being the 
northeastern and southwestern one and both sport bracketed torches.  Each of 
the six corners: north, northwest, west, south, southeast, and east, is set 
with a door.  In the centre, a narrow staircase also spirals down from the 
ceiling.  The walls, floor, and ceiling are made out of raw, harshly-hewn 
stones.  The surfaces are not smooth but irregular, and even sharp in 
places.  Some bits and debris litter the floor haphazardly, giving the place 
a somewhat derelict feeling.

    <editdraftcomments>I think the only thing I did here, carole, was exchange your comma for a 
colon with your list in the 2nd sentence.  Lastly, I only request that you 
mention some form of lighting in this room, and then you'll be all set to 
go.  Don't worry about sending another draft notice, I trust you, just throw 
it in somewhere :) thanks so much!

      <desc>The floor is made of the same roughly-cut stones as the rest of the room.  
Most of the edges have, however, been dulled, and the floor is smoother than 
any other expanse of stone.  Still, in the small crevices and furrows which 
remain, all kind of debris are gathered.  There are scraps of diversely 
coloured papers, some crumbs and other bits of food although those tend not 
to linger too long around, and even some cigarettes butts as well.  In a 
handful of places, there are also dark-red, almost black, round stains; in a 
couple of them are glued some strands of hair.

    <desc>This corridor is not very long, but it slithers away in so many (bends) that 
one (cannot) see around the next foot or so.  Still, six doors mark the 
progression through the corridor.  The two at either end, the north and 
south, are carved out of greyish wood, maybe poplar.  Four other are merely 
set in archways and open to the southwest, the west, the northeast, and the 
east.  On top of that, a strong wind whistles through constantly.  The 
walls, floor, and ceiling are all the same width of a little less than seven 
feet, and are made of plain, smooth, grey stones.  No definite source of 
light can be found, though the corridor is well lighted.  In reality, the 
utmost side vision often catches a glimpse of what could be giving off the 
glow, but every time the line of sight shifts to try and capture it in plain 
view, it is gone.

    <editdraftcomments>Basically all I did was put in a few commas that were necessary.  Overall 
good work, carole!  :) 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>In your echo #1, particular I think should be particularly, and you'll also 
need a period at the end of that sentence.  I edited your rattle ed.  In 
your walls ed, everything is fine except in the 2nd sentence, 'are the fact' 
should be 'is the fact', because your subject, fact, is singular :) also, 
you have 'stones' as a keyword for both eds.  I only got the first one when 
typing in 'look stones', so you'll need to decide which ed you want to be 
associated with 'stones' :) if that makes sense.  `-mira

most noticeable fact about these stones is their perfect circularity; in 
fact, from what can be seen of them, they are completely spherical.  One or 
two dislodged ones can be rolled around in their socket indefinitely.  The 
stones are also very smooth; it is a wonder the joint stuck to them at all.

seven-feet-high up on the wall.  The iron brackets holding the burning 
staffs are rusty but sharp, and ridden with lots of spikes.  The flames do 
not give off a warm, dancing glow, but rather a sputtering, yellow-green

pallor of a corpse.  Even the stones of the walls and archways look deathly. 
 Against the northern wall is a clepsydra; on the eastern, southern, and

 How creative, to come up with that lighting that makes your skin look so

      <desc>The clepsydra is simply composed of two containers, and a third one made out 
of glass.  The highest-set one is a large tank, that slowly lets liquid into 
a tall pitcher.  The latter has a little tube protruding from it, and into 
the wall behind the clepsydra; this tube is just below the vessel's brink 
and is meant to let out excess water.  From a small conduct at the base of 
the stone pitcher, water drips ever so slowly into the third container, a 
glass, graduated pitcher.  The level reached by the liquid indicates the 
date.  This liquid in fact is very strange; in spite of the low, sepulchral 
light, it looks very much blood-red.  Moreover, it is a thick, 
coppery-smelling liquid.

gives off a foul stench.  Still, the words, &quot;Entrance to Interrogation

    <desc>This stone chamber smells strongly of blood, vermin, and rotting death.  The 
once cement-coloured flooring is, if possible, now even more infested and 
unsanitary than the walls and the centuries-old layer of compacted dirt 
beneath it.  Two cobweb covered torches mounted on the opposite wall cast an 
eerie, foreboding glow about the room, but are just enough to show the deep, 
bloody scratches that have been hand-clawed into the granite stone by 
years-imprisoned fingernails.  Rusted iron chains drape across the top of 
the east wall, and a line of mounted whips upon the west.  Small, bloody 
chunks of flesh glisten malevolently on a few of the whips, cruelly awaiting 
their next victims.  The only means of exits are to the north, east, west, 
up, southeast, and southwest.

straw-woven seat, unsoftened by either cushion, or cover.  The only elements

at the bottom.  The stiff, green material is draped tautly on the metal

stem, resembling a succession of three balls interspersed with three convex 
tubes; at the upper end lies another such tube.  The top of the final piece 
is as convex as its side; this provides an adequate resting place for the 
round, glass globe set there.  This globe is like no Muggle light bulb.  
There is no filament inside; the globe is completely empty, indicating that 
the device doesn't burn at the turn of a switch, but with a simple magic

      <desc>The pot holding the plant is a dark-green ceramic, glazed in the fashion of 
the Far East.  The earth is black and rich-looking.  The bonsai is grown 
from a willow's slip and its branches hang dejectedly low.  These hair-like, 
languorous arms part atop the trunk, framing it in heavy locks.  Near the 
visible portion of the trunk, a minute, Buddha statue is sitting upright, 
with its legs akimbo.

    <desc>This office is like a gateway leading outside the hellish, grey stone of 
Azkaban.  The walls of the room are enchanted to look like vast woodlands, 
stretching on for miles.  Springy moss infests the flagstones underfoot, 
along with plump, contorted mushrooms.  Swirling, ethereal mist hangs down 
low, obscuring wild, creeping vegetation and crooked trees.  The dense flora 
bursts outwards in all directions, until it comes to a sweeping, round 
clearing, where all life stops in an unnatural halt.  Streams of dazzling, 
golden light fall into the glade, wavering like strands of Veela hair; their 
source is a ceiling bewitched to be a glorious mimic of the heavens.  Within 
this clearing, tree stumps of varying sizes, dotted before a long, flat 
piece of deadwood used as a desk, act as chairs for visitors.  An alien, 
haunting song of panpipes, drums, and the voices of nature resounds in the 
background.  Through the coppice, a leaf-green, painted door leads out to 
the east, bringing a shade of reality to the room.

    <editdraft>This office is like a gateway to a world outside the hellish bricks of 
Azkaban.  The walls of the room are enchanted to look like a vast woodland 
stretching on for miles.  Springy moss infests the flagstones underfoot, 
along with plump, contorted mushrooms.  Swirling, ethereal mist hangs in the

dense flora continues onwards, until it comes to a sweeping, round clearing, 
which cuts all life to an unnatural halt.  Streams of dazzling, golden light 
fall into the glade, wavering like strands of veela hair, they derive from a 
ceiling bewitched as a glorious mimic of the heavens.  Within the expanse, 
tree stumps of varying sizes act as chairs for visitors.  They are dotted 
before a long, flat piece of deadwood that is in use as a desk.  An 
otherworldly song of panpipes, drums, and nature sounds casts haunting music 
in the background.  Through the coppice, a door, painted leaf-green, leads 
out to the east, bringing a shade of reality to the room.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Oh, this is a beautiful office! There wasn't much I changed, either, just a few tweaks here and there, where a comma was missing, or there was an extra comma. I tried to reword some extra wording out of the text, also, and I capitalised &quot;Veela&quot;, which JK Rowlings writes with a capital V. No major comments here; the room is just beautiful! Well, well done! Huggles, Cristina
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
First, a general comment. Though all your echoes are very, very lovely, and mostly flawless, I think they are somewhat in contradiction with your desc, where you had an alien, haunting music playing. Maybe it would be handy to balance this sweet music here with a reminder of what is going on most of the time? Also,
 
1) Please make &quot;Panpipes&quot; &quot;Some panpipes&quot; or &quot;The panpipes&quot; in your second sentence of echo number [0].
 
2) Please change echo number [1] to: &quot;The enchanted ceiling darkens; the trees sway melancholically, as the sound of booming drums and the high-pitched crickets mark the coming of dusk.&quot;
 
3) Please make &quot;falls lazily&quot; &quot;fall lazily&quot; in your echo number [2].
 
4) In echo number [3], I am a bit confused: a honeyed scent is sweet, quite different from a fresh scent. Please choose between the two and remove the other accordingly.
 
EDS:
 
I've tweaked all your eds. Apart from a few commas and the word Quidditch spelled with a non-capital, there were not many things to edit. I've suggested a rephrase for the first sentence of the ED of ceiling. The reason for it is, the visitor of this office, for example a prisoner giant, might not have been to Hogwarts at all. You are of course free to rephrase yourself if you want, and then send me a note if you have done so. Otherwise, well, well done on this room; it's mindblowingly good! `-Cristina

    <editfirstcomments>I changed the word &quot;sounds&quot; to &quot;resounds&quot;.  I thought it flowed better with 
the sentence, but if there's anything wrong, I'll change it back.  Other 
than that, I loved your edits.  Thanks!

      <desc>What once might have been an impressively large and regal tree lies flat 
here on its side, dead.  Yet, on closer inspection, it becomes evident that 
it is in use as a desk, and although life has left it a long time ago, 
insects and fungi apparently haven't.  The top part of the wood is smoothed 
to an even surface; all sorts of creepy crawlies skitter along scrolls of 
parchment, and some even make their way to an inkwell, leaving little, black 
footprints along the desk's surface.  A modest tree stump rests behind the 
table, in use as a chair for the office occupier.  Branches of a nearby tree 
stoop over the area.  Curious objects hang down from them, showering the 
airspace with their contours.

      <desc>Many different objects dangle here from the limbs of long, knotted tree 
branches.  Mahogany panpipes, bound together with a colourful strip, sway 
serenely with delicate, metal wind-chimes that tinkle sweetly when the 
instrument is knocked.  Many, small, animated figures of people riding 
brooms hang at different intervals; they whirl around the office in loops 
and circles, re-enacting an everlasting Quidditch game.  Paper lanterns of 
myriad, pastel colours subtly illuminate the work area underneath them when 
the enchanted sky darkens.

      <desc>Any visitor who has seen the occasionally stormy ceiling of the Hogwarts 
Great Hall may find the enchantment here curious, since it doesn't reflect 
the weather outside.  This is probably due to the fact that around Azkaban, 
the atmosphere is always a sullen, uninspiring grey.  During daytime, the 
ceiling has a distinct, gossamer look about it that seems unearthly and 
unlike that of a real sky.  When the night looms, the firmament is always 
clear, obsidian black, with a pearly full moon and a patchwork of celestial 
stars.

      <desc>All sorts of different plants grow together in this room, regardless of any 
climate restrictions.  Whether it is funnel-shaped, stout, hairy, spiked, or 
insect eating, the vast vegetation creeps outward, over or under obstacles, 
thus creating a distinct, alien forest.  Flashes of light occasionally whizz 
to little dens and homes made in the undergrowth.  When the glints pause for 
a moment, they reveal radiant, delicate fairies, who flutter with gauzy 
butterfly wings on their tiny backs, leaving clouds of glittering, metallic 
dust in their wake.

    <editdraft>The inside of this room is draped in colourful, embroidered fabric, flowing 
from the centre of the ceiling.  It strongly resembles the interior of a 
circus tent.  A towering, aquamarine chair stretches up behind a golden, 
engraved desk, which houses piles of papers.  A model elephant, perhaps half 
a metre tall, prowls the carpeted floor.  A swathe of patterned, periwinkle 
cloth is pulled back with elaborate, gold tassels, revealing the exit to the 
west.  To top the tent off, a miniature, gilt trapeze swings breezily in a 
corner.

    <desc>This small, cluttered room gives off a pleasant feeling.  This may be due to 
the warm, red and cream hues, or maybe to the numerous cushions and 
comfortable seats.  All in all, this chamber feels less like an office and 
more like a resting place.  However, a small, low desk, flanked with 
Japanese stools, lies upon the middle piece of the thick, soft, floor 
carpet.  Filing cabinets hang down from the ceiling, lining most of the 
walls; beneath them stand bookshelves and a corner table; this table is set 
near the southwestern window, which opposes the only, northeastern door.

    <editfirstcomments>This is mostly a perfect room, no major comments on it. However, a general impression is that you tend to just overword things a bit. Please also try to avoid using expressions like 'the latter', because they are a bit formal and technical. The imagery though is breathtakingly-accurate and ample, and I always love the atmosphere you give your rooms. `-Cristina

      <desc>Cerise, big cushions and limp, scarlet bean bags litter the light floor in a 
seemingly haphazard way.  Against the west wall sits a huge, velvet, crimson 
sofa, with a slew of cream cushions on it.  The desk is carved out of 
mahogany, after a Far-Eastern fashion; the top is so low that one has to 
kneel or set one's legs akimbo to sit at it.  The stools are also made out 
of mahogany.  One does not sit on them, but kneel; a lower, red-padded plane 
welcomes the calves on either side of a vertical plank.  On top of this slab 
of wood is another pane, this one convex to better fit the roundness of the 
human backside.  All the red hues contrast neatly with the cream tinges 
around.

      <desc>The floor carpet is a thick, soft material and a glorious cream hue.  
Together with the similarly-coloured, stone walls and ceiling, the rug helps 
capture as much light from the window as possible, and renders the room 
merrier.  The filing cabinets and bookshelves are carved out of a blonde 
wood.  Its pale, colour pattern beautifully complements the red hues 
belonging to the rest of the furniture and the slivers of green, blue, and 
black from the books.

      <desc>The table is made out of the same, blonde wood of the bookshelves and filing 
cabinets.  It is set along the southern wall and near the southwestern 
window.  On the wooden pane are a couple of mugs, a box with tidily-disposed 
tea bags, a bag of instant coffee, a water pitcher, and a platter of muffins 
and scones.  The nearby window sill is high and narrow, but digs deep into 
the wall, so that it is thicker than it is wide.  A stuffed, worn, red 
cushion adorns it.  This appears to be the room resident's favourite resting 
place; indeed, it is not a bad choice, since it offers the opportunity of 
glancing at the ocean while comfortably drinking a warm cup of tea and 
nibbling on a sugary treat.

    <editdraft>A badly-maintained spiral staircase provides a path between floors in this 
part of Azkaban.  A thick coat of dust covers everything, although there are 
fresh footprints on the wooden steps.  The rich mahogany of the railing is 
accented by the gold support poles, sculpted into ancient symbols and images 
of wizardry.  The graceful staircase is marred by a long, splintered gouge 
along the mahogany of the left railing that serves as a constant reminder 
that this beautiful staircase is located in a prison housing some of the 
most dangerous wizards ever to walk the earth.  Beyond the shallow, broad 
steps are slightly visible stone bricks, worn down until each brick seems to 
be perfectly flush with its neighbors and forming a perfectly circular 
chamber.  A platform landing leads to five offices to the east, west, north, 
southeast, and southwest, while the staircase spirals up to end in a room, 
and down into darkness, through which only the pinpoints of candlelight are 
visible.

forming to forms :) I'm not sure if you've seen the 5th HP movie yet, but I

like I imagined, except for the part where it's surrounded by the sea.

    <desc>Instead of a spacious window, a large, anatomical poster of a crocodile has 
been pinned on the northern wall.  In fact, this is not the only instance of 
animal appreciation in the office.  The walls are simply plastered in 
posters, pictures and prints of exotic animals.  Scale models of Muggle 
beasts, alligators, snakes, and exotic birds, frolic around the desk and 
chair set.  A large sting ray with a harpoon in its gut hangs from the 
ceiling, enchanted and flapping serenely.  Aside from the masses of 
merchandise, the only furniture in the room is a desk, chair and coat-rack, 
upon which hangs a khaki-colored Australian hat.  A door to the south, a 
print of a desert snake hung upon it, leads the way out.

    <desc>The air is permeated with cold moisture.  A quick look reveals sinks, shower 
booths, toilet cubicles, and a bathtub, thus explaining away the humid 
atmosphere similar to that of a bathroom.  The stone sinks jut out from the 
silvery-green wall, one from each side of the only, eastern door.  On the 
left side of both lavatories is set a dispenser of a liquid, green soap, and 
on the right side a horizontal bar holds a plush, white towel.  A row of 
narrow, wooden shower cubicles hides half of the northern wall, while part 
of the southern one is covered by the equally-wooden toilet booths.  The two 
sets of stalls are separated by a mere couple of feet.  This narrow, 
enclosed way leads to the vast, luscious, and lavish bathtub as well as the 
magnificent, painted western window block.  The whole chamber, despite being 
misty, is quite clean and even inviting, in an aloft manner.

      <desc>The rectangular bathtub is carved out the silvery-green, stone floor.  It is 
bordered on the western side by a window block, the northern and southern 
sides by walls, and on the eastern side by both sets of stalls.  Between the 
latter two, a narrow way goes from the only door and into the tube.  A 
series of semi-circular steps lead from the floor level to the rectangular 
hole.  The steps and bottom are cushioned with a plush, bottle-green velvet 
carpet.  All along the tube, except for the steps, are set ten silver, 
old-fashioned taps with diversely-coloured balls on the faucet.

      <desc>The soggy velvet is so thick that the leg sinks in up to the ankle.  It 
serves a double function.  First, it dispels any risks of slipping off the 
stone floor; and even if someone does slip, at least their fall is somewhat 
cushioned.  Secondly, it allows lounging comfortably on the stairs.  Silver, 
semi-circular bars are placed in the corner of the steps, and embedded at 
both ends of the tub's wall; they prevent the material from floating up.  A 
silver lining also borders the cloth.

      <desc>The window is partly painted into a rendition of the &quot;Birth of Venus&quot; by 
Sandro Botticelli.  However, the beings depicted are tweaked in a wizard 
sort of way.  For instance, the central character, &quot;Venus&quot;, is represented 
by a Veela, as can be ascertained by her beauty, otherworldly glow, and 
silvery-blonde hair.  The picture also contains, from left to right, two 
winged beings: a woman in a white, flowered dress, and a grove of trees.  
Where paint doesn't cover the glass, the laden sea outside of Azkaban can be 
seen, thus completing the &quot;painting&quot;.

      <desc>The woman in the centre of the picture represents Venus, goddess of love.  
She stands on a scallop shell, in all her naked glory.  However, she 
modestly covers her alabaster breast with her right arm, while her left hand 
holds her silky, silvery-blonde hair over her pubis.  Moreover, she is 
acting shy; her head slightly bowed to the side, her eyes half-lidded, and a 
blush coming occasionally to her velvety cheeks.  Although her hair colour 
tells of a Veela, her attitude is not very veela-like.  
</desc>

    </extradesc>
    <extradesc>
      <desc>On the right of the painting, a woman is running towards Venus, holding open 
a robe to wrap the goddess in.  The robe is a velvety, orange terry cloth 
with green and white flowers embroidered on it.  The woman, like the main 
character, looks like a Veela.  A white, silken dress sheaths her; little 
silvery flowers adorn the material in a very bucolic way.  Her necklace and 
belt are woven out of leaves from the trees to the right.

    </extradesc>
    <extradesc>
      <desc>The two winged beings seem to be male; like the two women, their hair is 
silvery-blonde.  However, they do not display the same beauty.  The reason 
for this difference is mostly because they look like they are in the middle 
of a transformation.  Their noses are lengthening into hard, crooked beaks, 
wings are sprouting from their backs, and their nails are arching into 
talons.  They only wear loincloths as they glare with yellow, harsh eyes at 
Venus.

    </extradesc>
    <extradesc>
      <desc>The stalls are framed by beams and planks of a dark wood.  In spite of the 
overall dampness of the place, the wood seems to hold its own quite well and 
shows no sign of rotting.  Inside the northern cubicles, silver showerheads 
glisten out of the walls; a little, grated hole underneath is pierced in the 
ground.  The southern booths contain simple, enamel-white toilets.  A silver 
chain on the side of them allows someone to flush the device.

      <desc>The sinks are carved out of the same stone as the walls, ceiling, floor, and 
archway around the door.  This stone is of a silvery-green colour, with a 
gritty surface like sandstone.  Likewise, tiny, reflective particles gleam 
from within the material.  The sinks sport silver, old-fashioned faucets, 
while the towel bar and the soap holder are also wrought out of silver.  The 
towels are white pieces of terry cloth.  The soap is in green, liquid form 
and contained within a glass bottle; the said bottle is held upside down.  A 
mechanism is set so that when a bar on the front of the bottle is pushed, 
soap trickles down.  
</desc>

    <extradesc>
      <desc>. The taps are silver, cranked-down tube.  The faucet on top of the bend is 
round and thick, and six-spiked coins are on top of stubby columns.  In the 
centre of the coins are ten balls, each displaying a different symbol and 
colour: a yellow one has a point in the centre of a circle; a silver one 
shows a circle bearing both a cross and an arrow, and an orange one displays 
a circle sporting a cross on its outside.  One ball is blue with a cross 
inside a circle; a red one illustrates a circle and an arrow sticking out of 
the latter; a purple reveals a weird &quot;4&quot; in it, and a dark-grey one exhibits 
a sort of lower case &quot;h&quot;.  There is also a white one showing a circle with a 
point &quot;N&quot; as its centre, and an arrow on its border; a green one presents 
some kind of trident on it; and lastly, a black one has a funny &quot;P&quot; on it.

prestigious apple tree, planted right into the carpeting of this office.  
The branches tower over the room, each one sporting luscious, green apples.  
The tree shades a simple work-desk and the high-backed, red chair behind it; 
the branches cradle filing cabinets and wind around a coat-rack.  A 
mysterious light emanates from each of the apples, drowning the room in a 
warm glow.  The lighter branches frame a single, western doorway leading out 
into a common room.  
</editsecond>
    <editsecondcomments>The reason I yanked the 'huge' from your desc was that it gave the impression that this office had no ceiling. I put something less pretentious instead.
 
As a second comment, I replaced most of your 'the' articles with indecisive articles, like 'an' or 'a'. The reason for this is that you have not mentioned those objects before. So: 'the window' would describe a window already mentioned, but 'a window' could also describe a window you've said nothing about.
 
I also like the idea of the apple tree here. Beautiful imagery!

    <editdraft>The welcoming smell of cooking food permeates every corner of this office, 
from the bright orange walls, to the checkerboard lino flooring, to the 
swinging saloon-style doors on the northeast wall.  A large, dangling sign 
right in the middle of the ceiling reads &quot;Romey's Kitchen: The best food 
this side of Azkaban.&quot;  A buffet-style table stands in the middle of the 
room, splitting it in two.  An array of delectable yummies have been spread 
across it.  On the far wall, a large, chalkboard menu has been erected, next 
to a sign detailing the history of Romey's.  A collection of spindly bar 
chairs and tables grace the front portion of the room, giving the place the 
air of an Italian deli.

Soups and salads include lobster bisque, cream of mushroom, chicken noodle, 
Caesar salad, rocket leaves, and - the chef's special: Minestrone with a 
bell pepper garnish.  The beverage list seems to host every drink under the

      <desc>Next to the menu is a sign, with a story depicting the history of Romey's.  
&quot;Back in '69,&quot; it reads, &quot;Young office worker Romeo Thistlewaite was hired 
to file papers for Azkaban prison.  He was excited about his line of work 
and loved every part of it - except the meals.  The food he was served on 
lunch breaks was less than below par: It was positively atrocious.  He even 
had his suspicions that their cafeteria was feeding then leftovers from the 
prisoners.  Romeo, deciding that it was up to him and his culinary skills to 
save his fellow colleagues from prison food, began to cook up meals for 
everyone on his floor - right in his own office.  These meals were so good 
Romeo was egged on to cater for the entire tower, and soon the entire staff. 
 Romeo's humble office was transformed into a cosy, welcoming restaurant 
right here in Azkaban over the course of a few years.  Now, Romey's cooks 
fresh, hot meals daily; serving office workers, guards, janitors and even 
the kitchen staff themselves.&quot;

seemingly planted right in the concrete floor.  A dotting of rose bushes and 
vines accent the white walls.  The sound of running water emanates from an 
ornate, stone waterfall, installed right into the curving wall.  A hovering 
bulletin board, weighed down with notes, newsletters, and life-size photos of 
celebrities, floats right in the middle of the room.  A couple of lumpy 
armchairs attempt to make the landing look more like a lounge, rather than a 
Greek garden.  To top it all off, a particularly deadly-looking vine winds 
around the banister of a golden, spiral staircase, a little to the left of 
the bulletin board.

    <desc>. This office's layout is simple, square, and with a wide window to the 
north.  A highly mystical air surrounds the room, as incense sticks burn on 
top of file cabinets, and Asian-sounding, humming music flows from a 
gramophone in a corner.  Right in the middle of the room, a low, whitewood 
desk sits upon a bamboo mat, piled high with folders.  Instead of a standard 
office swivel chair, an Oriental pillow sits in front of the desk, imperial 
cranes embroidered on its surface.  A tiny, rocky waterfall has been 
installed by the door, the calming splashes of water adding to the 
meditative atmosphere.  Baby-blue Post-It notes have been stuck to the 
walls, encouraging the reader to &quot;get in touch with your wizard chi!&quot;  And 
that &quot;rest is good for the soul&quot;.  An abundance of softly-burning, scented 
candles light up the room, while a curtain of wooden beads to the south show 
the way out.

      <desc>A few grey file cabinets are dotted around the room, with colorful sticks of incense burning upon them. All different heights, the cabinet-and-incense structures look like modern art, swirls of smoke curling from their tops. The wafting scent of patchouli mixes with the scent of ink and paper, as the curls twirl up into the ceiling.

    <desc>For some reason, most of this office has been roped off with velvet cord.  
Jammed up near the door to the east is a cheap desk and chair set piled high 
with unorganized paperwork and, oddly enough, an old-fashioned cash 
register.  The shelves behind the desk are filled with books, souvenirs, and 
other memorabilia.  The roped-off section is perhaps the oddest of all.  
It's plastered from top to bottom with photos, newspaper clippings, and 
caricatures of a skinny man probably in his 20's, posing in this very 
office.  In this section is a neat, dusty office space filled with usual 
things like file cabinets, office supplies, and paperwork.  In a corner of 
the room is a glass case with a navy-blue tie displayed in it, lying, 
bloodstained, on a white, velvet pillow.  Above all this is a huge, 
cheerful, yellow banner, reading: &quot;Come see the old office of ALEX BONES, 
Azkaban employee turned serial killer!  The stories are true!  Animated 
Bones action figures now at 4.  99 apiece!&quot;

      <desc>Wooden, wall-mounted shelves behind the desk set hold a myriad of Alex Bones 
merchandise.  Little Alex action figures snarl and sulk in a corner, while 
Alex snowglobes rain white specks onto tiny, dead Alexes.  A good deal of 
books about Alex Bones sit on the shelves too, ranging from &quot;Favorite 
Bedtime Horror Stories&quot; to &quot;Crazy: The Truth About Alex Bones (as told by 
Anya Devon)&quot;.

    <desc>The first thing that one notices about this office is its extraodinary, 
vivid colour.  A white pair of curtains frame a wide window to the east, 
letting light stream onto the white furniture.  A white desk with blank, 
white papers stands in front of a plush, white armchair.  Tall, white 
bookcases stretch up to the ceiling.  A white, wooden door leads the way out 
to the west.  A white floor rug, oddly smelling of vanilla and camomile, 
engulfs one's feet in inch-deep whiteness.  What is strange about this white 
room is that everything is so pristine, clean and neat; not a speck of dust 
can be seen.

    <desc>Piles and piles of Muggle film equipment crowd this simply laid-out office.  
Reels of film are stacked in every corner, piled on chairs, and all over the 
desk.  A rusty file cabinet, papers literally heaving out of its drawers, is 
bogged down with different sets of tripods.  Tall, spindly movie cameras, 
looking like creatures from another world, loom over the room.  Enchanted 
film reels unroll themselves across the wide window to the southwest, so one 
can see the images on them flicker by.  The best thing about the room is 
that it's well-lit, so every piece of camera equipment is illuminated in a 
warm glow.  There's also a mostly uncluttered opening to the northeast that 
one can slip through to get out.  The one uncluttered surface, a small side 
table, stands right in the centre of the room.  The only object on it is a 
brightly-coloured, slightly thick book.  &quot;The Movie Maker's Bible - For 
Wizards&quot;, it reads in shiny, gold lettering.

environments, how to dull down magical occurences so they look like 'CGI' 
fit for a Muggle production, and other such things.

    <desc>This office has a simple layout, squared, and with a wide window to the 
southeast.  The room is almost completely plastered in photos of a pretty, 
blonde witch; some in frames, some tacked to the wall.  Everywhere the eye 
turns, the blonde witch smiles, sleeps, and blinks in her own, little 
photograph.  A plain, work desk stands in the middle of the room, a simple 
chair behind it.  Neat, little organizers are piled on a corner of it, and a 
solitary photo of the blonde witch in a frame dominates another corner.  
Glowing stripes on the ceiling, some obscured by photos miraculously taped 
to them, light the room.  Someone's tried to block the northwest door to the 
room with a chair, as if hiding a dirty secret and not wanting to let anyone 
know.

the five offices on this floor.  The place gives off a laid-back, noisy 
ambience.  A dusty radio in a corner cranks out the WWN, as loud as it will 
go.  A ragged set of sofas and lounge chairs sit along the walls, well-worn 
and stained.  A bulletin board on the south side of the room bears a huge, 
bright pink sign that reads &quot;Don't forget; THIS WEEK's Slack Off Saturday!&quot;  
right next to an 'Employee of the Month' photo that someone has doodled 
on. The magazine rack, sitting next to a dumpy, maroon armchair, is filled with
sports, music, and fashion magazines.  Five different doors lead off into 
five offices, to the north, east, west, southeast, and southwest.  A golden, 
spiral staircase is set right in the middle of the room, going down to the 
other office levels.

southeast, an old-fashioned, chipped door swings around, always unlocked.  A 
sliding glass door, set into the southwest end of the room, offers a view 
into an office seemingly overrun by foliage.  Finally, a cracked redwood 
door lies to the west, old rock songs barely heard above the loud pop 
blaring from the radio.

wall a huge window looks out on the Azkaban compound and the tumultuous 
North Sea.  The room is kept pleasantly cool, a drastic change from the 
chill of the main prison.  Neat, little family photos are peppered on the 
west wall, depicting typical scenes, like picnics in the park and days at 
the beach.  Underneath the photos a dismal, little plaque with a scratchy 
engraving reads, &quot;The company regrets your loss&quot;.  A nondescript, wooden 
desk and a hard, mahogany chair stand by the east wall, facing away from the 
window.  A steady stream of light, provided by glowing tubes plastered on 
the stucco ceiling, illuminates the room in a light glow.  A scattering of 
papers are piled on the grey, carpeted floor, seemingly accumulated from 
weeks of neglect.  A thin door swings on well-oiled hinges to the south.  
The whole room gives off a cold, sad air, as if whomever works here would 
never be happy again.

      <desc>A large, wide, clear window, with not a speck of dust on it, is set into the 
northern wall.  Through it one can see the cold, dark North Sea and part of 
Azkaban.  A set of blinds have been installed and are pulled down over the 
window.  They are turned on their side, so one can still see through the 
window.

      <desc>Family photos, all in neat, thin, little black frames, hang on the western 
wall.  In most of the pictures, a smiling man and woman are posing with a 
little girl, probably no older than three.  One photo, in a thin, white 
frame, is set apart from the rest.  It's turned on its back, but glimpses of 
it can be seen when a draft blows through the door.  From what one can tell, 
it depicts a woman and child, posing for the camera, while a 
sinister-looking man lurks in the background, hand hovering over his wand.

    <desc>This office's layout is simple, square, with a wide window to the west.  A 
gramophone cranks out old rock songs in a corner, slightly shaking the room. 
Three or four posters for reunion tours and bands long retired are pinned 
on the walls.  A framed photograph of a young, red-headed man, grinning in 
front of the Eiffel tower, hangs on the south wall.  A bright, neon green 
desk sits facing the window, stacked with folders.  A coat-rack stands to 
the east, by the door, holding nothing but sauce-stained ties and the odd 
shirt or two.  A round disc on the ceiling lights up the room in a bright 
glow.  It looks as if whoever moved into the office hasn't been here for 
very long.

    <desc>This room is square, slightly high-ceilinged, and reeks of take-out Chinese 
food.  A box of half-eaten noodles sits on a wooden desk in a corner of the 
room, next to a tattered &quot;Quidditch International&quot; magazine.  A wide window 
is set into the east wall, next to a flock of wizardly Post-It notes that 
flutter around the bottom of the wall, waiting to be read.  A life-size 
poster of the current Holyhead Harpies seeker is attached to the north wall. 
 A swivelling chair wheels its way around the room magically, deliberately 
bumping into walls.  The room is lit in a sunny glow, thanks to the 
enchanted orbs wedged into the ceiling.  A plain, wooden door stand to the 
west, a cutout from a magazine pinned on its panelling.

    <desc>This room's walls are white, but you would have never guessed that from the 
alarming amount of foliage growing everywhere.  A wide, clean window to the 
southwest offers a view of Azkaban's grounds.  Surrounding the clear window 
is a mass of vines, ivy, and a large creeping stalk with small red bulbs on 
it, threatening to break through the ceiling.  A pale, wooden desk sits in 
the middle of the room, a timid little potted plant seated upon it.  Three 
wooden shelves filled with gardening magazines and plant catalogues are set 
into the southeast wall.  A sliding glass door is the only exit from this 
jungle; it takes up the entire northeast wall.  A glowing plant in a silver 
pot lights up the entire room in a golden glow.

A large, thick stalk winds on the wall as well, but has already reached the ceiling and refuses to come down. Small cracks have started to appear where it hits the roof.

    <desc>The layout of this office is simple, a square room with a window.  High up 
the tower and overlooking Azkaban, this otherwise bare room is adorned with 
a multitude of sketches: hanging on the walls, piled on the floor, and even 
wedged into the cracks of the desk.  A wide window is set into the southeast 
wall, mostly covered in cream-coloured drawings of the Azkaban premises.  
The part of the desk that isn't covered in paper is taken up by boxes of 
pens, pastels, and a bottle of Butterbeer.  A lone armchair, striped in 
candy-cane colours of white and red, sits in a corner, a pile of notebooks 
stacked on its seat.  A few finished sketches of a woman in a dress smile 
prettily on the southwest wall.  A large, round disc, set into the ceiling, 
illuminates the room in a warm glow.  A door stands to the northwest, the 
only exit from this cluttered office.

    <desc>.  Cold, hard, damp, and unwelcoming, the stone floor is covered with deep 
scratches. The thick slabs of stone which serve as walls are as equally as 
uninviting as the ground. Slashes of blood have long-since made their home 
on these walls, as have a number of bite marks, large holes, shallow 
scratches, burn marks. Present in the large cell is a single cufflink. 
Barred with spikes set to punish any creature that may consider tearing it 
from the ground, the cufflink is linked to a short metal chain. Flying about 
the ceiling is something that could be a wounded owl, clearly the remnant of 
something's last meal. The floor dips in a spot, and it is in that spot 
where a not-so-small puddle of water rests. The door - a heavy, metal one - 
leads east.

quick swipe at something that was just out of reach.

    <desc>Wide and tall, this cell is clearly made for larger magical creatures. The 
ceiling - an astounding eighteen feet - is crisscrossed by thick, metal 
bars. Through these bars another empty space is visible, though it is too 
dark to see the ceiling of that space. The walls are stone blocks, and no 
windows decorate them. Eight feet from the ground are a few torches which 
burn brightly. Several phrases are etched into the stone, some deeper than 
others. The floor plays host to random bits of hay and straw which are 
scattered over its surface. In a corner lays a chunk of stone. A metal 
barred door leaves west to a corridor.

are scattered on the walls. One reads: &quot;e will pay&quot; and another: &quot;will hunt&quot; 
and another: &quot;kill for food&quot;. Across one of the walls is a poor attempt at a 
calendar, and it would appear the maker became frustrated and attempted to 
knock down the wall.

    <desc>The bottom of the stairwell is damp and bleak, as its tainted grey walls 
twist upwards it suggests only more of its depressive nature. A spiralling 
succesion of thick, rugged blocks run up between the walls, giving sight to 
a path leading to a higher level of the prison. Faint sources of light run 
down the circling wall and provide the viewable, dramatic path upwards. A 
discreet corridor leads off to the northwest, dodging between cells. To the 
west, a heavy, wooden door blocks passage to one of the Bestia Turris' 
cells.

      <desc>The sturdy, wooden door stands tall in its stone frame, lined by steel (or 
what mimics steel) bracing. The door offers no viewport except the 
draft-ridden gap underneath it, permitting the door to open if need be. A 
faint, blue-glow seeps through the bottom of the door, only visible due to 
the dark surroundings of the area.

confine a small creature.  Every opening, down to the cracks between the 
stone blocks in the walls, is covered by a fine mesh, not unlike that on a 
Muggle screen-door.  This mesh, however, has a faint, bluish glow, most 
noticeable in the darkness.  The only exit is a heavy, wooden door to the 
east, covered by more of the glowing mesh.  A window to the west offers a 
view of the sea, coloured by the ubiquitous, blue glow that is the only 
light in the room besides that which trickles in the window.

to squeeze through, but a housefly would have no chance.  It hums ominously 
with a tooth-shaking, low, throbbing sound.  The blue glow that surrounds

    <copyright>Copyright © 2005  Jessica Ayers &lt;slimshadylady78@hotmail.com&gt;</copyright>
    <desc>. The spiral stairwell is made of stone blocks.  This stairwell seems the 
dregs of earthly existence.  A thick, black sludge lays, scattered, on the 
steps.  The walls are damp and holes are visible in the stone.  Random 
scratches litter the stairs and walls.  A small window has its place four 
feet off the ground - an insult to any whom wishes one last glimpse of the 
outside world.  There are three torches burning on the inside wall of this 
staircase, though they barely allow enough light to clearly see the ground.  
The dingy place leads west to a cell, northwest to a Bestia Turris Corridor, 
and down.

      <desc>The stairs play host to thick, black sludge. Residing in small piles, and 
apparently favoring corners the goop smells strongly of tar. Though it 
bubbles slightly, the sludgy mess barely focuses attention from the various 
scratch marks on the staircase. Deep and long, the scratches nearly cover 
the walls and stairs. Some zigzag, some are in sets of five, others in sets 
of two, three, and four. Clearly many creatures are brought up this stair 
against their will.

    <desc>The sloping, stone walls of this cell lean against each other to form a 
perfectly equilateral pyramid.  The walls are made from small, scuffed, 
stone bricks and are covered in incomprehensible markings and crudely drawn 
stick figures.  The floor is dusty and covered in sawdust, underneath which 
lies a leveled bed of sandstone.  As for illumination, a single torch hangs 
from the ceiling, cradled in a wrought-iron holster emblazoned with a 
capital &quot;A&quot;.  The lingering stench of raw meat is suspended in the air.  A 
heavy, wooden door with latches is on the eastern wall, serving as the 
cell's only exit.

deformed-looking stick figures adorn what space the words haven't covered.  
Near the bottom of the walls, smudged blood stains are clearly visible.

    <desc>A live-sized, vivid statue of a woman stands in the eastern doorway, her 
eyes and attention focused only on the cell lying past her to the east.  
Apart from that peculiar exit, there are three other ways out of this area.  
Light-grey cobblestones cover the northern part of the room and lead, 
through a passageway, to a cobblestone corridor.  The southern part of this 
corridor is inlaid with huge, pinkish slabs of sandstone, as is the 
stairwell past a southeastern archway.  Where the differently-sized, 
differently-coloured coverings clash, rises a dark-stoned, spiralling 
staircase; carved in careful imitation of a whirlwind, it is a beautiful 
work of art.  Unfortunately, many gouges, stains, and odd bits mar it; in 
fact, the whole room bears the marks of some vicious attacks and desperate 
struggles.

      <desc>A solid wall, about three-foot-high, rises around the outer perimeter of the 
spiralling staircase instead of a railing; the stone of this parapet is 
furrowed with needle-thin grooves that symbolise the turbulent coiling of 
some wind.  On the other hand, the centre space of the stair is empty of any 
column or supporting device, like the eye of a tornado.  A more immaterial 
current whistles almost constantly down the shaft.  The steps of this stair 
bear traces of foregone engravings of clouds, suns, stars, and moons; the 
passing of time, the pacing of many feet and paws, and the frenzied trashing 
of frantic souls have almost completely erased them though, just like the 
memories of the sky are eventually erased from any prisoner's mind.

nails still abruptly embedded in the wood, set beside dark pebbles that are 
in fact clots of blood, and spidery hair that's still glued besides impact 
marks.  All the traces are a horrendous, yet necessary testimony of darker 
days, when Azkaban was not only a prison, but an endless pit of despair 
ravenously feeding on one's hope, sanity, and eventually one's life.

    <desc>This seven-foot wide, cubic cell has in the northwestern corner a doorway 
leading out west; however it doesn't have a door.  Instead, the statue of a 
woman stands, a constant guard on the doorstep.  Her restricting uniform has 
moulded her body in a stiff posture.  Her Mao jacket is adorned with a 
epaulette on the left shoulder and stop right at the waist.  Her large belt 
presents a silver buckle.  From said buckle, a leather strip loops down to 
the top of her riding breeches tight, then comes up back up to connect again 
with her belt in the middle of her back.  Another leather strap goes round 
her thigh and is sewn with the diagonal piece of leather.  The belt and the 
two leather bands have little hooking device on them, to hold a whip.  
Presently, the whip is in her fingerless-gloved, left hand and coils down to 
the ground.  Her knee-high boots are extended with front protections up to 
mid-thighs.  To top her austere look, her hair is pulled into a tight 
ponytail, and her mouth is set in a stern line.

The bed is made with fresh sheets and the food is edible. The real torture lies within the haunting presence of an exit which is forbidden to come near.

      <desc>(To be made as an object) The statue is magical: whatever comes within three-feet of her is whipped mercilessly until they draw back, lose consciousness or die. Those whippings are the only time the statue departs from her strict expression and allows a cruel smile to twitch the corner of her mouth. Though able to talk, she is mostly reticent.

    <editdraft>The corridor is dim, the only light coming from the stairwell to the 
southwest.  The hallway is short and wide, a stark contrast to the other 
corridors in Azkaban.  The floor and walls are made out of the same 
cobblestone material as the stairway before.  The only exit is a cell to the 
west.  From that cell is a chill that permeates through the entire corridor 
creating a frosty damp atmosphere that cuts to the bone.  The exit is a 
large brass door that is partially opened.  The brass is tarnished, damp, 
and cold to the touch.

      <desc>The brass that makes up the door lost its gleam long, long ago.  Instead 
there is a dull shine that recedes and advances with the flickering of the 
light at the end of the corridor.  The door is plain, with little to no 
adornment.  The locks are solid, sturdy, and no-nonsense.  The hinges are 
made in the same fashion as the locks.  The face of the door is slightly 
dented, the thumps occurring on the inside of the door and the evidence 
being on the outside, proof of the violent instances inside the doors.

clouds swirling about.  Lightning flashes create a strobe light effect, 
while all noise is drowned out by the constant thunder and rainfall, though 
the floor shows no signs of rainfall.  There is a short walk way with a sign 
at the entrance of this cell.  The floor that sits below the entrance, looks 
smooth as glass.  It reflects the ceiling like a dirty mirror.  The room is 
vast.  Compared to outside the door, the size of this room is impossible; 
two Quidditch pitches in length and width.  There are no windows, the walls 
have been bewitched to look like they stretch to infinity.  The exit, a 
large brass door, is to the east.

irregular and smoothed by the constant, furious walking of a very large 
occupant.  Enchanted silver chains hanging from the ceiling give off a

damaged in places, as though one or more of the former prisoners beat off 
its loneliness by bashing them.  The western door into this room is

    <editdraftcomments>Dear Russell, nice to see you back! Your style here is very descriptive of the general elements of the room, which I like. However, what I would like to see more from you is more of a prison-feel. People feared Azkaban - true, mostly because of the Dementors, but even without those, it is still a prison. Therefore, I would like to see it have a more sinister feel, like something constricting and terrible to be in. I've added a few of my own ideas here; you are free either to accept them or to rephrase your own text accordingly (however, if you do your own rephrasing, please send me a note). I've also removed the sign, as that would usually be seen OUTSIDE the cell, and not inside. If you do have the time, please check out some of the other * rooms here, so you get an idea of what we accept as canon Azkaban. Carole/Noon's rooms are particularly delicious. 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>.
ECHOES:
 
1) Please edit echo number [0] to: 'The enchanted, silver chains sway from side to side.'
 
EDS:
 
1) Please remove the sign ed (check the comments for the reason why).
 
2) I don't really understand your chains ed. What do the chains strengthen? Furthermore, please give a short description of the chains themselves in your ed, rather than just stating their purpose. While that is a nice detail to have, the players will be lookin for more descriptive info as well.
 
Thank you for your efforts, Russell; they are greatly appreciated! `-Cristina
 
Editing, take two:
 
ECHOES:
 
1) Please change echo number [1] to: &quot;A menacing, piercing howl echoes boomingly from the west.&quot;
 
EDS:
 
I would suggest removing your &quot;silver&quot; ED entirely and adding the keywords &quot;silver&quot; and &quot;enchanted&quot; to your &quot;chains&quot; ED. I've edited this ED to incorporate both texts. As you are not using the chains for anything quest-related at the moment, I do not see a reason for the added difficulty of having an ED streaming from another ED for a simple, clearly visible object such as chains. Please do feel free to argue the point however if you wish, and please take a look at my edit of the ED when you get a moment. 
 
Thank you again for your prompt response and for your enthusiasm! `-Cristina

      <desc>These silver chains extend down from the ceiling, enchanted to emit a soft, 
golden glow.  The end of each chain has a large, silver binding.  Apart from 
illuminating the cell, these clanging, heavy, silver objects appear to have 
a more sinister use as well, judging by the tell-tale, bloody marks on the 
chain ends.  The magic that vibrates around each link strengthens it so it 
would hold against even the strongest, most desperate pull.

    <desc>Claimed by Nate Claimed by Kyden The floors of this decrepit dark corridor 
are slightly wet and glowing due to the toxic fungus that is leaking out 
from the cell door to the west.  The wall is a dark stone, same as the floor 
but with several deep gashs much like the ones in the stairwell to the 
Northwest.  Also along the walls are deep gashes that are almost identical 
to the ones in the stairwell but more worn thanks to the slime.  On the 
south wall hangs one solitary torch giving off its faint depressing glow.  
Along the west wall a large iron door is firmly latched with a bolt easily 
the size of a human ankle.  To the Northwest is an eerie stairwell with a 
dark red smear along the threshold going along the floor leading to the grim 
cell door.

    <editdraftcomments>Hey Nate, this is an awesome first room.  Your only errors seem to be 
grammatical ones and a few minor content issues.  It's really a great room, 
though, and you definitely got the atmosphere right!  Kudos.  Okay, first 
things first.  When you add a desc to be edited, you go into &quot;redit&quot;, then 
type &quot;view&quot; and then &quot;edit draft&quot; and put you draft in here (the editor 
works the same way as for &quot;desc&quot;).  You only put the desc into &quot;desc&quot; after 
it has been edited.  J I know it can be confusing at first, so no worries.  
As for the editing: Sentence one: Please add a comma after &quot;decrepit&quot; to 
separate the adjectives.  Also, &quot;floors&quot; should be singular, as there is 
only one.  Like wise, &quot;are&quot; should be &quot;is&quot;.  Sentence 2: &quot;gash's&quot; and 
&quot;one's&quot; do not need apostrophe's, the plurals are &quot;gashes&quot; and &quot;ones&quot;, 
respectively.  W.  Please add a comma after &quot;gashes&quot;; and &quot;Northwest&quot; does 
not need to be capitalized.  Sentence 3: This is very repetitive of the 
sentence before it.  If you would like to add something about the slime, 
maybe a sentence along the lines of, &quot;Adding to the occult sensation of the 
room, oozing slime has worn away parts of the walls.&quot;  Or something you 
like, but without the repetition J Sentence 4: Please add a comma before 
&quot;one&quot; and &quot;solitary&quot;, to separate the adjectives.  Sentence 5: Please add a 
comma between &quot;large&quot; and &quot;iron&quot; to separate the adjectives.  Sentence 6: 
&quot;Northwest&quot; does not need to be capitalized.  &quot;Dark-red&quot; should be 
hyphenated.  Also, you can't describe the corridor ahead.  If you must, you 
have to do it vaguely (&quot;looms eerily&quot;, &quot;With a forbidding air&quot;, etc), but 
describing it leading into a cell door is too much info.  Let the players 
walk into that room to see what it's like.  Otherwise, an outstanding room.  
I loved it, you definitely work well in Azkaban!  Cheers.  Xoxo Jess 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ED 1) You don't have any text for this. Also, you can not have an ED with keywords that are not in the desc, because the players won't know how to look at it. (They will only see the desc and will have to type &quot;look rat&quot; to see the ED of your rat. But if there is no rat in your desc, they won't know to look at it.)
 
ED 2) Please add a comma after &quot;rat&quot;. Change &quot;center&quot; to &quot;centre&quot;, as we spell things the British way, and not the American. And &quot;it's&quot; should be &quot;its&quot;, as with an apostrophe it means &quot;it is&quot; and without one, it is possesive. Finally, please add &quot;slime&quot; to the keywords.
 
ED 3) Please remove &quot;looking&quot; after &quot;intimidating&quot;, because if you describe it as &quot;intimidating&quot; it is given that is how it looks, and it just adds extra, unneeded words.
 
ED 4) Please add a hyphen between &quot;six-inch&quot;. Around the edges of what? Be specific. Around the walls, the ceiling, the floors, the entire room? We don't want to leave the players guessing. We want them to get exactly the feel we're trying to make.
 
ED 5) &quot;Iron&quot; does not need to be capitalized. &quot;Glimst&quot; is not a word. I have no idea what you meant, but this needs to be changed J . &quot;Colored&quot;, should be spelled &quot;coloured&quot;, as that is the correct, British way to spell the word. I know, as an American it is difficult to spell things British, but if you are using Microsoft Word, you can go to the &quot;Tools&quot; tab at the top (next to &quot;file&quot;, &quot;edit&quot;, etc) and select &quot;language&quot; and then &quot;set language&quot;, and change it from &quot;English: United States&quot; to &quot;English: United Kingdom&quot;, and then Word will tell you when you spell something in the American way. J
 
You also reuse a lot of words (intimidating, eerie, etc) and while it is okay this time, normally we crack down on it. I highly suggest this thesaurus (www.m-w.com), as it is easy and very useful. I use it when I write rooms here, too!
 
Echoes: Your echoes are absolutely perfect. Good job. This was a really great draft, I loved the imagery. Keep them coming! Xoxo Jess

stairwell.  On the south wall hangs one, solitary torch giving off its faint 
depressing glow.  Along the west wall a large, iron door is firmly latched 
with a bolt easily the size of a human ankle.  To the northwest is an eerie 
stairwell which emanates a foreboding atmosphere.  A dark-red smear jus just 
visible over the threshold.

    <desc>The walls and ceiling of this chamber are covered with fungi.  These minute, 
spherical mushrooms are the tone of sickly flesh and exude a pale, deathly 
light; an oozing, toxic, corrosive substance drips endlessly from them, 
filling the chamber with the nauseating odour of decaying corpses.  Touching 
this substance causes burns, which can get steadily worse, possibly lethal, 
after prolonged contact.  Ingesting the mushrooms or the ooze is equally 
fatal.  The heavy, hazardous dripping insistently trickles down the walls 
and pools on the uneven floor, making death an appealing alternative to 
imprisonment here.  A particular, deep pool in the northwestern corner 
serves as a toilet.  The only sanctuaries away from the poison are a stone 
slab serving as a bed, a few stepping-stones from this layer and the eastern 
door, and a cat-flap meant for food.  The air is suffused with poisonous 
fumes, making it difficult and painful to breathe.

    <editdraft>The walls and ceiling are covered with fungi.  The minute, spherical 
mushrooms are a sickly-flesh tone and give off a pale, deathly light.  They 
also ooze a toxic, corrosive substance, which smells of decaying corpses, 
like the fungi.  Any organic substance in contact with this poison will 
suffer minor chemical burn; however, if the contact is prolonged, the burn 
can turned severe or even lethal.  Ingesting the mushrooms or the ooze is 
equally fatal.  But after a time, death can look like an easy way out of 
here; really easy indeed, since the toxin is everywhere.  It drips 
hazardously from the ceiling, trickles down the walls and pools on the even 
floor.  One of these pools, in the northwestern corner, is particularly deep 
and serves as a toilet.  The only places free from the poison are the stone 
slab that serves as bed and a few step stones from the said bed to the 
eastern door ?  And to the flap for the food tray.  The air is suffused with 
poisonous fumes, making it difficult and painful to breath.

    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1. Please change echo number 3 to: 'Toxic drops deibble in quick succession.'
 
2. Please change echo number 4 to: 'The poison drips noisily into a pool of itself'.
 
The rest is perfect. Well, well done! `-Cristina

    <desc>The cell is dank, stale, and very uninviting.  It is really small in size; 
only four meters wide, deep, and tall.  The floor of the cell is covered in 
a thick layer of soil as dark as night.  The terrain of the floor is very 
rugged as if made to resemble the Dark Forest.  Thin trees sprout out of the 
floor and seem to simply disappear into the ceiling which looks like the 
nighttime sky.  The only light comes from the moon light piercing through 
the trees.  The moon shining above is constantly full.  A thick, rusty, 
steel door sits in the east which is the only exit out of the cell.

    <editsecondcomments>Lovely Allison, I've tweaked your desc a bit. However, where I put the second part of your text between brackets, I would actually suggest that you make an echo instead saying something like: 'A large rat scurries inside; the eyes watch it intently, as though it were something very precious indeed.' Then, you could write an ED of 'rat', which would contain that second part of your desc, only directed at the rat. I think it would be more effective that way, but, of course, it's your final decision. `-Cristina

protests.  As the hands come to life, the scars are reopened and torn once 
again.  As it is embedded deeper into the skin, the wire begins to glow with 
a stronger intensity.  Small wisps of smoke rise from the abrasions and the 
hands move furiously against the pain.  The reek of burning flesh permeates 
in the air, triggering gag reflexes in any but the most hardy of

    <editdraft>The cobblestones are uneven and rough because the cement holding them 
together has fallen out over the years.  The walls are close on either side, 
only allowing one person through at a time.  They slant upwards to create a 
narrow ceiling with now light fixtures, only water stains.  There is a 
single barred window high on the wall that allows limited light to filter in 
through the cobwebs, insect carcasses and dust that have accumulated there.  
Despite the opening that allows some air into the space, the corridor smells 
of stale air, must, and the prisoners a short distance away.  The corridor 
continues forward into the southeast and forks off to the east.  Both exits 
are gloomy and dismal.

have entwined more than empty bug shells over time, they also trap dirt and 
dust from the outside, making any light flowing through them dingy and gray.

almost-opaque mist.  The vapour-like tendrils are thin, as though from a 
scalding shower, and, due to the high humidity level, it is difficult to

visitor is thus both trapped in a lifeless infinity and closed in from every 
side.  Once shut, the door, of the same blazing-white as the walls, 
completely fades into them.  It becomes impossible to say where the way out 
is, especially as the cell is a perfect cube, with not even a minute window

doomed to fail, as the walls regenerate in a couple of seconds.  The only

the meagre meal is consumed, the can is taken away through a cat-flap, 
leaving the room and any inhabitant in a misty, never-changing void.

leaving the room and any inhabitant in a misty, never-changing void.

    <editfirstcomments>Just tweaked a few things here and there, but otherwise, this room is absolutely beautiful... in a very horrible sense of the word! Great effort! `-Cristina

    <desc>A tall, barred door glares from the western wall; from everywhere around it, 
walls of black earth crumble onto and into the floor.  From the triangular, 
northwestern opening, some ragged-edged cobblestones stagger across the dark 
soil and towards the southeastern corner.  There, a sturdy plank sticks out 
of the wall, followed by many more like it.  Steadily, the wooden steps rise 
up towards the western wall, turning alongside it to continue north and out

    <editdraftcomments>Awesome work here, Carole! Just tweaked out a few of the prepositions to give this some better fluency. Much love, Cris
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please change 'come' to 'comes' in echo [0]. 
 
The other echoes here are dandy, though I have to say, echo number [0] is still my absolute favourite. It's so poetic and full of life! Much love, Cris

    <desc>The floor of this cell is hidden under dozens, possibly hundreds, of bones.  
Though most are small, probably belonging to rats, some bigger ones 
occasionally pierce through the mass.  The minute knuckles, skeletal arms, 
ears, ribs, and pelvises are brittle; a single step could make their 
sickening perfection crumble to bits.  No amount of treading, however, can 
diminish the ivory mass.  New, complete bones are reborn of the shards, 
which either disappear or blend into the walls and ceiling.  Indeed, the 
edges of this cage are made of black earth, all the darker for the chalky 
fragments embedded in them; their sharp ends point to the centre of the 
cell.  The only bone-free sanctuary is a stone slab protruding from the 
western wall, opposite the only door; unfortunately, the place is barely 
wide enough for one to lie down on.  Any prisoner, however, would have an 
uncomfortable, tense sleep in a sideways curl, lest they impale themselves 
on bones and cruel shards.

    <editdraft>The floor of this cell is hidden under dozens, possibly hundreds of bones.  
These are quite small-sized, and probably belong to rats, although a few 
bigger bones poke out of the mass here and there.  All the osar are brittle: 
they snap loudly with every step and break into pointy, sharp fragments.  
However, no amount of treading can diminish the ivory mass.  New, complete 
bones seemingly come up while the sherds apparently either disappear or are 
used on the walls and ceiling.  Indeed, the latter are of black earth, all 
the blacker for the chalky shards embedded in them, nasty end pointing at 
the centre of the cell.  The only place entirely free of bones is a slab of 
stone protruding from the western wall, opposite the only door; but it is 
barely wide enough for one to lie on its back.  Plus, the recumbent person 
has to actually sleep on their side and close to the edge, lest they skewer 
themselves on the sherds from the nearby wall.  They also have to mind their 
sleep, lest they fall on bones and bone shards.  
</editdraft>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1. Please change echo number 0 to: 'Bones creak.'
 
2. This is only a suggestion, but perhaps change echo number 1 to: 'A bone shard reflects off a sick, grey light.'
 
3. Please change echo number 2 to: 'The bones rattle with an echoing gurgle as a draft of air shifts them.'

    <editfirstcomments>I've only tweaked things here, though they didn't need it much. I did run amock with some imagery in sentence two, but I thought that actually listing the bone fragments might have a bigger impact. Especially the ears. You're doing a smashing job here... literally, too! :S `-Cristina

    <desc>Upon entering through the only, eastern, screen door, the moist, hot air 
clamps the airways and almost instantly glues hair and clothes to the skin.  
In spite of this stuffy welcome, the cell looks spacious and somewhat 
pleasant.  The walls, ceiling, and floor are dug out of a rich, black soil.  
A trickle of water slithers down the north wall and forms a small, 
mostly-still pond in the north-western corner, which quietly disappears to 
the south through a mosquito-netted hole the diameter of a finger.  Despite 
the penumbra - since light only comes in through the door - some kind of 
large-leaved, tropical-looking, exuberantly-flowered plants clutter around 
the small body of water and invade a good portion of the space.  In fact, 
only the bed and a semi-circle around the door remain free of this invasion; 
any progression elsewhere in the room means elbowing leaves and stems out of 
the way.  However, the real evil of this room is far smaller and more 
intrusive: mosquitoes.

    <editdraftcomments>Dearest Surabhi, this is a great room! All I've done so far was look into the comma use in this one and check out the wording. The only more serious thing here is that I could see the &quot;up&quot; exit nowhere, so I added it. For the rest, well done and keep this going! Hugs, Cristina

      <desc>The corpse of the rat emits a foul, unbearable odour of rot and decay.  A 
few fat maggots, the size of human fingers, are busily feasting on its 
flesh, which seems to keep replenishing against the skeletal bones.  A 
warning against any inkling of hope prisoners might have, the oozing, 
stinking dead creature is a sign of the countless, untold terrors of 
Azkaban.

    <desc>A couple of feet away from the main, western exit of this room, another 
six-foot-tall door separates the cell in two unequal parts.  Hooked to the 
wooden walls between the two gates are: a halter, bits and reins, a saddle, 
and a nasty collection of riding crops and horsewhips.  On the ground, 
amidst scattered straw, lie: a pair of cowboy boots - complete with sharp 
spurs - curry combs, a bucket, and carrots.  The vegetables are rotting, 
giving off a foul smell, but are otherwise completely untouched.  Past the 
high door, the stall is barely wide enough for a horse; it's also just long 
enough to contain a mount and a manger.  On the other hand, the wooden 
ceiling is sufficiently high for a rider not to bump their head.  A round 
window is set in the roof, allowing the inmate to see the stars on clear 
nights.  It is a small treat for the usual occupants of this cell, and the 
only one they may hope for in these surroundings: Wood and leather here all 
bears scenes of centaur humiliations.

    <editdraft>A second, head-high, wooden door stands a couple of feet from the main, 
western exit, and separates the room in two unequal parts.  Between the two 
gates, are hooked to the wooden walls, a halter, bits and reins, a saddle, 
and a nasty collection of riding crops and horsewhips.  On the ground, 
amidst the strayed straw lay a pair of cow-boy boots, complete with sharp 
spurs, curry combs, a bucket and carrots.  The latter are rotting, giving 
off a foul smell, but are otherwise completely untouched.  Past the 
head-high door, the stall is barely wide enough for a horse; likewise, it?  
S barely long enough to contain a horse and a manger.  On the other hand, 
the wooden ceiling is high enough that a rider wouldn?  T bump their head.  
A round window is set in the ceiling, allowing the inmate to see the stars 
on clear nights; it is a small treat for the usual inmates of this cell, 
especially in regard to the rest of it.

    <editdraftcomments>Dearest Carole, I've taken a look here, and the description is awesome, though the fluency is a bit off here and there. I made a few tweaks -- for the better, I hope. The first sentence however is put between brackets as it sounds very strange. Also, 'head-high' is a bit of an evasive adjective. There are tall people, short people, girls, and boys, so head-high is probably not a good indication of the height of that door. :D I wrote a suggestion there, but please free to rephrase in your own words. Awesome work here, as usual. The cell is extremely rich in detail! `-Cristina
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please change echo number [1] to: 'One of the carrots levitates to about the height of a centaur's mouth, hanging there for a few seconds.'
 
2) Please add: 'through the room' at the end of echo [3].
 
3) Echo number [4] is a bit strangely phrased. Please also consider the fact that you haven't told us about the centaur paintings in the desc. Which makes the echo doubly beautiful, of course, but you need to change it a little bit. :D
 
EDS:
 
You have the same text in both eds. I've edited the one under: riding, but I think that's the one that should be under 'door'. Please add the second ed text, so I can also edit that. Much love! Cristina

      <desc>Every surface in this room is engraved with scenes of centaur humiliations.  
The wooden surfaces in particular bear scenes of centaurs being treated like 
horses: here a human figure rides a centaur, here they whip the horsy being. 
 Others depicts saddles or halter being harness on a centaur, or reins being 
pulled tight, forcing the centaur to hold his head high or have the bit hurt 
his human mouth.  There again, a centaur accepts a carrot from a human, 
directly chewing at it from the offering hand, instead of seizing it with 
her own hands.  To add insult to injury, every centaur shown here is 
smiling, as if willing to debase themself into serving as a common mule.

The leather planes in particular show scenes of centaurs being put 
forcefully back into their rightful position.  In one such depiction, a 
wizard has cruelly curled his hand into the human mane of a centaur, forcing 
him to kneel despite the equine jointures' inaptitude to doing so.  In 
another scene, a centaur is being whipped; in yet another, the poor being is 
forced to back off into a stall very much like this cell.

    <desc>A revolving stair takes up most of the space in this little, round room.  It 
doesn't really lead anywhere, not to another room at the least; the 
beautifully-carved wood only rises to an alcove and a heavily-barred window. 
 Still, this view is much better than the slimy, stone walls, ceiling, and 
floor.  Straw intrudes from a southwestern passage and, in the space between 
that archway and an imposing, western door, a skeleton has fallen into a 
mere heap of bones on a straw mattress.

    <editdraftcomments>Wonderful work in this one, Carole, and my edits are really just a couple of tweaks. Although I do understand why you would use things like 'THE western door', I would prefer it if you used 'A western door' instead when you haven't mentioned that archway before. I also used to do that all the time, until Tina set me straight... repeatedly :D Much love, Cris

    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please move 'hurriedly' in front of 'titters' in echo [1].
 
2) Please change echo [4] to: 'Darkness slowly takes over as the sun sinks slowly down the western sky.'
 
EDS:
 
I've checked both your eds. Please look at them when you get a chance. Awesome, awesome work with the skelly idea here, and I adore echo number [3]. Much love, Cris

      <desc>The convoluted forms of ghosts and lost souls are carved with intricate 
details in the massive, ebony wood of the stairs.  The whole, revolving 
movement of the banister flows naturally from the writhing of the tortured 
shapes making up the railing.  The morbid theme is carried over to the 
alcove; crossed bones and skulls are engraved into the stone walls, floor, 
and ceiling of the small recess.  Even the large bars before the 
thick-glassed window bear motifs of grim reapers and fleeing, terrified 
mortals.

      <desc>Time and scavengers have only left the bones of a poor soul on the thin pile

skeleton seems held together by magic, rather than by any physical remains.  
The corpse is still coiled in a foetal position around a bottle with a 
rolled-up paper inside; the bony digits, however, have long since lost their 
tight grip on it.

    <desc>At first glance, the cosy, comfortable aspect of this fairly-large cell is 
most striking.  If not for the reinforced, eastern door, it could easily 
pass off as a room in the Three Broomsticks.  A plush bed in the 
northeastern corner, a marble sink in the southeastern one, a neat table in 
the middle, and a large window in the northern wall all give off a rich, 
privileged aura.  Contradicting this impression, however, is the bare 
western wall, made of grey stone.  An iron-wrought cheval glass, also called 
a psyche, stands right in front of it.

    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Echo number [1] mentions an eye, which does not appear in the desc. Please rephrase the echo so that someone who didn't read all your eds can still understand it.
 
2) Please change echo number [2] to: 'Although neither rats nor rat holes are visible within the cell, unmistakable squeaks reverberate through the large space.'
 
3) Please add a comma after 'things' in echo number [3].
 
4) 'albeit' means 'despite the fact that'. I think you could use 'otherwise' or 'apparently' instead of it in echo number [6].

      <desc>From a few feet away, the sink looks luxurious, mimicking a thick stem 
blooming into a white-marble flower.  A golden, similarly-themed faucet 
completes it.  To the side stands a white-wood, carved cabinet above which 
hangs a set of plush, terry-cloth towels.  Everything changes though when 
any person walks within one foot of the contraption.  Though the form is 
still roughly the same, gone are the delicate decorations, which are 
replaced by gruesome details.  The stone sink is now of plain, grey stone, 
covered in slimy mosses and crumbling away in places.  The faucet is shaped 
like a slug, spitting out fouled water.  The towels, though still soft, are 
covered in best-left-unidentified stains.  The cabinet, now a rotting piece 
of wood, rattles with the creatures inside of it.

single, red rose stands in the middle of the cloth.  The chair appears 
rather plain, but comfortable, with a thick cushion.  However, no sooner is 
the seat occupied, than everything takes on a new aspect.  There are rotting 
bits, mouldy patches, and spider webs everywhere.  The silverware is now 
black with oxidation, although some other, rather-unsavoury stains can be 
made out.  The rose fades; not only that, but it becomes slimy with rot, 
teeming with repulsive spiders and fossilized solid.

touching it, this invitation turns into a nightmare: humungous amounts of 
minute bugs start crawling among strange, miniature clusters.  A closer 
examination reveals both head and crab lice creeping among their own nits.  
In addition, several suspicious stains mar most of the materials, as well as 
the headboard.

case given the climate.  A waist-high ledge is littered with cushions.  
However, as one reclines against the sill, everything changes for the worse. 
 The light suddenly disappears as the window is revealed to be onto a dark, 
bottomless pit.  A set of bars anyone from taking that exit.  The pillows 
are stained, and their material is worn thin; in fact the stuffing shows up 
in places.  Many insects crawl around and cold seeps from the rotting stone 
ledge.

pivot all the way around.  Above either face of the cheval glass is carved 
into the thin, metal frame: &quot;psyche of the psyche&quot;.  In fact, psyche can 
refer both, as it does here, to a mirror, and to the soul.  This magical 
item shows in this case the darkest corner of one's soul, contorted with 
boils, horrible afflictions, and gruesome deformities.

    <editdraft>An inebriating, heavy stench hovers in the air of this small cell.  Its size 
is almost claustrophobically narrow, making the cell feel like a closed-off 
portion of a tiny hallway.  Eyes can barely adjust to darkness here, since 
this cell is without a single light source aside from the light that comes 
through the screeching iron door to the west.  Dozens of long claw marks are 
etched everywhere along the walls and the floor, accompanied by hundreds of 
specks and smears of something unpleasantly green.  There are even some claw 
marks on the door, which seems to have been constantly repaired after being 
broken by whatever creature used to reside within these walls.

    <editeds>Hi Kristina!
 
I'm suggesting you change slightly your echo to &quot;A [] screeching sound suddenly resonates from somewhere near, as if coming from within the very walls of the cell.&quot;, which is slightly lighter than your current sentence.
 
See you!
Carole

    <editfirstcomments>Hi Kristina!
 
As you can see, I'm suggesting quite a few changes. Your imagery is as delightful as always, but I think I'm beginning to identify your quirks: mostly I feel like you lengthen sentences a bit too much.
 
Now, please don't take that in the wrong sense! I'm pointing at this, because it's always easier to see from the outside; but if you don't know your habits, it's not even possible to change them. I've been corrected many times by Cristina, Jess, and Mira, and I've (hopefully) become a better writer thanks to them.
 
Oh, and was it really inebriating (as in 'causing drunkenness') you meant to use? Just asking, because it sounds strange here - but maybe that was what you were going for? As well, I'm not sure what 'screeching-iron' is: could you please explain?
 
Hoping to read more from you soon,
Carole

    <desc>A minute, foot-high archway opens to the west of this area, while a 
larger-than-life one leads northwest.  Both these openings are barely more 
than holes, flanked by three, dolmen-aligned, rough stones.  The rest of the 
walls are similarly made of crookedly-leaning, ill-fitted menhirs.  The 
ragged slits let in dust-filled air and the only lighting of the room.  Also 
squeezing through are the moans of prisoners and the wind, both ghost-like 
and faceless.

    <editdraftcomments>Dear Carole, this desc is very good, and I only tweaked it here and there. However, I do have the feeling that this room is lacking a bit of atmosphere that your usual rooms have; if you feel like it, and you don't think me too cruel, please try to revise it a little. As a secondary point, I don't see any extra lighting in here; if there isn't any extra light but what comes through the cracks, please make it extra clear. Much love, Cris.
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please change 'An' to 'A' in echo [2].
 
2) Please change 'echoes' to 'echo' in echo [3].
 
3) This is more of an aesthetic point, but I think it would be better to changing 'mumbles drift' to 'mumbling drifts' in echo [4]
 
Thank you so much for everything you're doing, Carole. You're my supergirl! Much love, Cris

    <desc>This chamber is entered by passing under an stone archway; no door nor 
curtain blocks the path or view.  The walls, ceiling and floor are all made 
of the same, grey sandstone as the archway.  In the southern wall, two large 
windows are pierced, while a plush bed is pushed against the northern one.  
The room is permeated with the gentle scent of freshly-cleaned material; 
this smell comes from numerous clothes hanging on threads stretched from the 
eastern, archway-adorned wall to the western one.  The garments' lower edges 
are about levelled with human shoulders, although the clothes themselves are 
more like house-elf-sized.  An elf could never catch the fabric without a 
little, charming help; however the diverse pieces of clothing all display 
inscriptions, orders, and bans, including one against using magic.  The 
clothes are enchanted to cry out every so often the information written on 
them.

    <desc>Huge slabs of stone are piled up into walls, floor, and ceiling in this 
cell.  They are not perfectly fitted together, so that the cold, outside air 
can come in at will.  Moisture also pervades through, further lowering the

before finally sifting down to the lower level through by crevices.  
Nevertheless, the slits between the stones are useful, as they occasionally

metal-barred door leads into an eastern cell, while an archway leads to a

    <desc>Huge, stone blocks construct the jagged perimeter of this circular 
penitentiary. Misery and loneliness hang like deadweight in the dry air. 
Large, metal bars, standing inches away from the wall, act as reinforcement 
in case the occupant of this cell attempts to escape. Clearly visible 
beneath small bones and craters are enormous, overlapping, stone slabs. 
Torches burn a dazzling, white light that nearly reaches the twelve-foot 
ceiling. No windows are present in the room; instead a metal-barred door 
leads east to an upward stairwell.

    <desc>. More of a closet than a room, the cell is five feet long and three feet 
wide.  Dangling six feet from the stone ground, a pair of metal cuffs, 
designed so the owner of the cell may not sit but instead is forced to 
stand, are covered in rust.  A window lives sorrowfully eight feet above the 
ground, directly atop the cuffs.  Its face covered by bars, its tearful 
irony is that no prisoner here could ever look through it into the abyss 
beyond.  The ground is but a smooth layer of dirt.  The walls are a grimy, 
disgusting, unleveled rock.  A thick, black door leads west.

the grey walls. The high ceiling is covered in spider webs and small 
animals, which may be bats. The floor plays host to a number of cracks and 
holes, some larger than others. Toward the west the cobblestone floor turns 
to a solid block of stone. Cold and unwelcoming, the slim passage extends 
northwest and southwest, while a barred gate guards a western cell.

two feet, though fortunately the cell is not much larger than that. Four 
feet by four feet, the cell has only enough room for a single occupant.

    <editdraftcomments>Dearest Carole, this is a good room, and it shows a lot of descriptive power! I particularly like the narrow steps - that description is awesome! I've made only a few edits, since I thought a few of those sentences sounded slightly odd. Where I've set ()s, it means that I'd prefer you to rephrase it, but it's up to you how; all I've done is shown you an example. As a note; you had no northeastern exit in your original room, so I added it here. Hugs, Cristina
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please rephrase echo number [1], as it's a bit unclear. Which dark corners? Also, usually corners are not so good for bouncing off - they amplify and split the sound, since you have three surfaces to bound against, all bound into one. 
 
2. Please change &quot;of&quot; to &quot;off&quot; in echo number [2].
 
3. Please add a full stop at the end of echo number [3].
 
I like your first echo here; it's extremely poetic, and something I can see very clearly! Hugs, Cristina

    <desc>Four-foot walls curve around the perfectly circular ground. Four, metal 
chains connect to the smooth, flat ground and are used to restrain 
prisoners. Specks of blood litter the twenty-seven foot area of the ceiling, 
though they are not visible anywhere else in the cell. A small, oak door, a 
mere four feet in height, but already reaching the upper margins of the 
room, leads west to an upward stairwell.

    <desc>This stairwell is extremely narrow and steep, designed to hinder prisoners 
from escaping.  It is strangely angular from every direction; each step is 
cut at a slant, making it bend very sharply.  The walls leading up to the 
tall ceiling lean in, increasing the tight, claustrophobic atmosphere.  The 
steps and walls are untouched by time, completely devoid of chips or 
scratches.  To add to the unnatural stillness and monotony, there are no 
windows to admit air into the stairwell.  The multiple torches sit 
unnaturally still, barely flickering, and the only discernible odour is the 
weak scent of their burning.  The stairs continue further downward and a 
door leads to the east.  A corridor to the northeast provides the only 
opening away from the tightness.

of the step, the riser bends back into the staircase, causing the step to 
angle sixty degrees rather than the customary ninety.  Like the walls, the 
steps are immaculately carved of stone.  They are narrow and steep.

    <desc>This rectangular room is barely large enough for the single, narrow cot it 
contains.  The ceiling is low, so that a tall man would have to stoop to 
avoid hitting his head.  Lying on the floor is a pair of iron shackles, 
fastened to the wall with a heavy chain.  The room smells of dust and 
staleness.  No torches or lanterns exist to illuminate it; the only light 
comes from the small, barred window on the east wall, opposite the only 
door.  The room is painfully cold, as the smooth stone walls and floors do 
nothing to hold heat and very little sunlight can find its way in through 
the window.  The quiet in the cell is absolute; no birds, no crickets, no 
rats break the perfect monotony of the silence.

mar their shiny surface.  Even the chains show signs of careful tending; 
they do not creak nor groan when moved, but merely clink pleasantly.  The 
sound is frighteningly-loud in the stillness of the room.  The magic in them 
is almost tangible; they seem almost alive with power.

    <desc>This corridor is cramped and stifling despite its impressive width and high 
ceiling.  Continuous, dark stone floors and walls do not allow the room to 
breathe, making it extremely warm.  The air is stale, and four large torches 
along the walls add to the heat.  The floor is somewhat uneven, as the large 
blocks of stone do not always line up perfectly.  Some of the blocks are 
missing along the walls, creating dark gaps, filled with spider webs.  
Similar spider webs nearly cover the ceiling and glisten in the corners of 
the room.  The corridor bends slightly in the middle, leading northwest and 
southwest.  Dark and dank, the northwestern corridor is as unwelcoming as 
the southwest end, where a spindly image of a gigantic spider is carved into 
the wall, its two front legs bending down to embrace a narrow doorway.  A 
steep set of stairs is barely visible through this old, stale frame.  To the 
west, a heavy door leads into a cell.  One, last exit stands in the form of 
a mighty, spiral staircase, leading upwards.

      <desc>It is impossible to see into the gaps in the walls, due to the webs.  Their 
white and silver strands are woven so thickly through the holes that they 
almost look like cloth.  Small bugs are caught in the webs.  Some of them 
are still struggling to get free; many of them hang lifeless.

      <desc>The spider carving is intricate and grotesque.  The spider itself must be 
ten feet in size, since just its front legs encompass a doorway seven feet 
tall.  Its pincers quickly open and close, eagerly and silently, and its 
body writhes slightly, as though waiting for prey to walk through the door.  
Up close, you can see that even the individual hairs on the spider have been 
carefully carved.  Above the door, shining, black stones have been set into 
the eyes of the spider.  They glisten menacingly as they catch the light 
from the torches.  Further up, the faint outline of an hourglass is visible 
on the abdomen of the spider.

    <desc>Distance is relative here.  It is difficult to focus in this cavernous, 
stone room.  Walls of jet-black, blistered stone appear to advance and 
recede, like an implacable tide.  One moment the lone window, high in the 
western wall, may look no more than an arm's length away.  The next, it 
seems half a mile distant, with a monstrous expanse of open floor stretching 
beneath it.  The air is rustled by occasional gusts, their source unknown, 
bearing the crisp smell of a frigid midwinter day.  A door stands in the 
east wall, open and inviting.

      <desc>The walls of the enclosure are smooth, almost as if this space had been hollowed out of raw bedrock. The stone from which they are hewn is unfamiliar- dark, smooth, but without the sheen of stones like obsidian. The walls seem to bulge in places, almost as if they had at one time both boiled unnaturally and been frozen in the same moment.

    <desc>Along the black circle of this corridor's walls, round moonstones alternate 
with copper-bracketed, azure-flamed torches.  The electric-blue tinge 
flashes off the obsidian, polished expanse of the walls, ceiling, and floor, 
like Joy trapped in Melancholy's lair.  The overall sheen and colour 
patterns evoke the iridescent flight of a raven; indeed, such a bird sits on 
the only, northern window in the room, in the form of a stained glass panel. 
 Opposite to this work of art, a southeastern archway opens under the 
vigilance of a stone serpent, while a low, eastern door hunches its 
unattractiveness between huge, bright-blue pillars.

    <editdraftcomments>Dearest Carole, your rooms are as radiant as ever! I've checked this one out, and I really love your desc! There are only very few edits I've made, but please let me know if you disagree with any of them! Well, well done! Hugs, Cristina
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1. Please change echo number [1] to: 'The stone serpent rearranges its scales along its perch, causing the sculpted leaves below to rustle.'
 
2. Please add a full stop at the end of echo number [2].
 
3. Please change &quot;I?m&quot; to 'I'm' in echo number [3].
 
EDS:
 
I've edited all your eds. Furthermore, I would like to add the following comments:
 
1. Please add snake and reptile to the keywords of the ed of serpent.
 
2. In the ED of branch, I wonder if the last sentence wouldn't do better to be scrapped and an object be made of the figs. Any interaction with this object would bring up that line, for example.
 
3. Please add sputtering to your ed of sputters.
 
4. Please add scratched to your ed of oval. 
 
5. Please add &quot;brackets&quot; and &quot;light&quot; to your ed of torches.
 
For the rest, all is well. Wow, a lot of work gone into this room - impressive!! Hugs, Cristina

      <desc>In a manner reminiscent of a caduceus, this serpent entwines around an 
arching branch, which follows the curve of the archway below.  Both the 
beast's watchful eye and occasionally-probing tongue are azure, and its 
silvery, stone body displays a bluish sheen.  The snake's thick, slick coat 
looks like an impenetrable armour; however, two scales - one near its 
visible eye and the other at the tail - are slightly raised, leaving two 
slanted access-ways to the vulnerable flesh underneath.

      <desc>The moonstones are embedded at eye-level, and in fact present &quot;eyes&quot; 
themselves - that is, a slight difference in their middle, giving them the 
semblance of pupils.  It is impossible to evade their obtrusive stare as 
they circle the hideout-deprived room and never blink.  Even the 
surrounding, angelic-blue pillars have flat, oval, eye-shaped opals set on 
any intruders.  Some visitor may have tried to escape such constant 
vigilance by prying out the accusatory stones; the guilty persons were 
probably stopped as soon as they tried, as only one opal is surrounded by 
scratches.  The square columns reach all the way to the high ceiling, 
whereas the heavy, cadenassed door they keep up only rises up midway.  The 
magnificent, translucent, matte-blue of the pillars strongly resembles the 
hue of copper sulphate.

Once the most resplendant of songbirds
The raven was pure-alabaster
Until it displeased the Sun God
Bearer of a lyra and a quiver
 
First it waited for a fig to ripen
When he was under the divine order
To fill with water a crater
And covered with a serpent
 
Then it announced to the archer
That Brute force had taken
The crow Goddess, his lover
 
Finally, the now-black raven
Lost its songs by recounting
Asclepios's death by lightning.

    <desc>Four, stone walls, barely four feet high, prop up an absurdly-low ceiling in 
this cell.  There is no floor in the room, only a thin, metal platform 
suspended over a bottomless pit by a set of rusty, iron chains.  Dotted 
around the short walls like fireflies trapped in a glass jar are small, 
glowing orbs that give off little light.  A constant rumbling floats up from 
the gaping hole beneath the platform, echoing off the walls.  An odd smell, 
a little like sulphur, radiates from the walls.  The whole cell is eerily 
cold, even though it should be quite warm in such cramped circumstances.  A 
low, bolted, metal door leads west - the only exit in this disturbing place.

    <desc>This staircase descends gradually, winding in a sharp spiral; the ceiling 
hangs only five and a half feet above the steps.  The stone steps are 
crumbling a bit from wear and loose pieces of stone litter the way.  No 
railing wraps around the edge of the staircase, allowing a perfect view of 
the straight drop downward and of the corridor below.  The column core of 
the stair is decorated with various carvings.  A hooded figure with a scythe 
stands guard at the base and a vulture glides around and around the column.  
No torches or windows provide light; the only illumination comes from the 
surrounding rooms and stairwell.  To the west a stone door leads the way 
into a cell.  To the southwest lies a corridor and to the northwest is 
another stairwell.

blade of his scythe greedily, his head following your movements as though 
he's watching you.  The vulture also seems to be following you as he flies 
above the other carved creatures.  A chimaera twitches its dragon tail 
restlessly as you pass.  As a tribute to the prison's guards, a depiction of 
a dementor stands at the very top of the column.  Though no rattling 
breathing is emitted by the stone carving, the hovering creature is 
terrifyingly lifelike.

    <desc>Four chains have made their home on the dampened stone floor of this twelve by ten cell. A large, black tub floats five feet in the air directly above the bisector of the chains. Eight feet high, carved out of the jagged stone, are three large windows. Light and a gentle breeze - weather and time permitting - flow easily through the cell, as if to add insult to injury. Four torches glow brightly on each wall so to be certain the prisoner never feels alone. A stone door leads east to the downward stairwell.

      <desc>Made to clamp the wrists and ankles of the cell's occupant, the chains will shorten or lengthen so as to keep the their prisoner flexed of their back. When a person is imprisoned by the chains the tub will automatically begin to empty itself one drop at a time. With each falling drop landing on its stomach, the prisoner slowly loses their sanity. As the tub nears emptiness it magically refills itself.

    <desc>Except for rodents and insects, life rarely enters this corridor and it 
shows in everything from the spider webs in the corners to the thick layer 
of dust that covers the floor.  No torches or windows provide light; the 
corridor sits in complete darkness.  The cobbled stones of the walls are 
dark, as though trying to drain the hallway of any light that might find its 
way in.  The only vestige of light is the very faint glimmer that comes from 
the staircase to the northeast.  The strong scent of rot and death almost 
entirely overcomes the smell of dust and mould that hangs in the still air.  
The southwest end of the corridor ends abruptly with a solid wall; to the 
east, a heavy door bars the way into a cell.

    <desc>This warm cell is filled with an awful smell, unmistakably the odour of rot 
and death.  The heavy stone walls hold the scent and the heat in, and keep 
any fresh air out.  The small room shows all the signs of being forgotten; 
everything in it is covered with a layer of dust and something strange and 
brown is growing at the base of the east wall.  A pile of rusty chains sits 
in a heap in one corner, still fastened to the wall.  Nearby, a strange 
white object sits on the floor on top of a dark, crusty stain.  A tiny, 
unmade cot sits with a folded stack of linens atop it.  An old torch sits 
uselessly on the floor, next to a door that leads west into a corridor.  No 
other torches fill the brackets around the walls, and there no windows; the 
room sits in total darkness.

      <desc>TO BE MADE INTO AN OBJECT The small white object is about four inches long, 
and jointed into three sections.  It is, upon closer inspection, the bone of 
a finger.  The stain which it sits upon is a reddish brown, and has a fetid 
and faintly metallic scent.  This is clearly the source of that smell of 
death and decay; human bones and dried blood.

    <desc>This long staircase curves gradually upwards before disappearing into the 
dark.  The western side of the staircase is open to the corridor below, 
though the open air is stale and warm.  Only a thick railing stands between 
the stairs and the drop downwards.  Like the staircase itself, the railing 
and walls are made of a dark, polished stone that makes the light dance and 
reflect from one surface to another.  This makes the corridor surprisingly 
well lit by the four torches set into the eastern wall.  The stone is 
crumbling and chipped in places, revealing an ugly, rough grayish stone 
beneath the layer of dark stone.  In the middle of the torches is a heavy 
door, leading into a cell.  An unlit spiral staircase leads to the 
southeast.

      <desc>The railing twists, like a rope that hardened.  It is smooth and cold to the 
touch and the reflected light makes it surprisingly bright, considering 
that the stone itself is almost black.  Every few feet a support goes from 
the staircase to the railing.  Each support stands on a clawed foot that 
blends into the step it is perched on and flares out at the end to meet 
with the railing.

    <desc>This tiny cell could easily pass for a closet if not for the well-groomed 
chains hanging from the southern wall.  Three feet by three feet, the room 
is not even large enough for a man to lie down.  As if to compensate, the 
chamber is extremely tall.  The ceiling cannot be seen, so that only 
blackness looms overhead.  This does not make the area feel any larger 
however; it just emphasizes the tightness.  The walls are made of a course 
grey stone, as is the floor, which pitches downward to the north.  The 
western door, which has no handle, is made of the same material and is 
indistinguishable from the other walls when closed.  The narrow box has no 
windows or torches and sits in complete darkness.

    <desc>The dark stone of this staircase gleams in the light of the two torches on 
the eastern wall.  The granite is so dark that it is almost black.  Despite 
being polished and well-maintained, it is worn through and cracked in 
places, so that the rough, grey stone of the under layer can be seen.  
Though the staircase descends to the floor below, it is short, ending here 
in a platform.  A heavy, oak door leads eastward from the platform.  To the 
southeast stretches a corridor.  Along the western edge of the steps is a 
railing, winding like a thick rope.  Beyond the railing there is only 
darkness.  There is no wall closing the stairs in, but in the darkness it is 
impossible to tell what lies below.

    <desc>The cell is a circle with a grand twenty-foot diameter. The walls and floor 
are smooth as smooth as glass and the fifteen-foot ceiling slopes to the 
east. On the eastern wall is a six-foot window. Five bars - three 
horizontally, two vertically - cross the face of the otherwise bare opening. 
The only accessory in the room is a chair. A huge, oak door leads west to a 
downward staircase.

      <desc>A metal chair sits expectantly in the centre of the cell. Facing the exit, 
the chair has eight leather bands attached to the it ready for use. Once 
a body is placed in the chair the bands attach themselves: two on each arm, 
one on each shin, one around the stomach, and one around the forehead making 
it impossible for the prisoner to remove itself from the chair. The holder 
of the cell is given only the bare essentials for life, and they are forced 
to consume it. Whoever sits in the chair is kept alive for a very long time 
unless, by some great surge of will, they manage to let themselves die.

    <desc>The pitch-black darkness of this corridor seems to have substance, like a 
thick, velvety shroud.  The walls, ceiling, and floor seem to merge into 
one, big, fathomless abyss.  A blinding, sanguine beacon dramatically 
reveals a western wall, and although it brightens the area, there is 
something sinister about the glow.  Fixed in an everlasting glare, the 
source of the oppressive glimmer is an eye, big enough to have belonged to a 
giant.  The single, permanent ray of scarlet light streams from the pupil.  
Inserted into the wall in a crescent shaped socket, the eye stands guard 
above a steel, reinforced door, which scintillates in the illumination, 
creating the semblance of being raw with wet, vermilion blood.  Through the 
distance, faint dots of light blink both northwest and southwest, revealing 
exits from the dank corridor and the uncomfortable glowering of the eye.

    <editdraft>The pitch-black darkness of this corridor seems to have substance, like a 
thick, velvety veil.  The walls, ceiling and floor seem to merge into one 
big fathomless abyss.  A blinding sanguine beacon dramatically reveals a 
western wall, and although it brightens the area, there is something 
sinister about the glow.  Unfortunately, it becomes more unpleasant under 
closer inspection, as the source of the oppressive glimmer is revealed: an 
eye, big enough to have belonged to a giant, extrudes the ray of scarlet 
light from its pupil.  Inserted into the wall in a crescent shaped socket, 
it stands guard above a steel, reinforced door, which scintillates in the 
illumination, creating the semblance of being raw with wet, vermilion blood. 
 Through the distance, faint dots of light blink both northwest and

glaring of the eye.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Oh, dear, this is a wonderful cell. Gave me the willies! And I mean, seriously, even though red's my favourite colour. whoa, what an idea with that eye! 
 
Anyway, I've only edited bits and pieces here. The edits between parantheses are, as ever, suggestions. The only things that I want to list down as main comments are:
 
1) Minor point, I know, but still: please place commas between adjectives, like: &quot;blinding, sanguine beacon&quot; rather than &quot;blinding sanguine beacon&quot;. Also, add commas before the &quot;and&quot; in a list of at least three nouns. So: &quot;Walls, ceiling, and floor&quot; rather than &quot;walls, ceiling and floor&quot;.
 
2) Please try not to insert your emotions into players. For example, try not to say: &quot;it becomes more unpleasant&quot; . I mean, for all we know, Bellatrix Lestrange could find this unbelievably funny and cheerful. I tried to rephrase it a bit more neutrally, but as ever, you are free to use your own words.
 
That's all for now. I absolutely loved the first two phrases and the description of how the eye is inserted into the wall. The atmosphere is perfect. Well, well done, Grace! `-Cristina
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please add a comma after &quot;whistling&quot; in echo number [0]. List of three and all that.
 
2) Please change echo number 2 to: &quot;Muffled, terrorized screaming resonates along the walls of the midnight-black corridor. The sound grows louder until it halts with a disturbing silence.&quot; 
 
3) Please add a comma after &quot;sick&quot; and another one after &quot;blinding&quot;
 
EDS:
 
I've edited your ed; please have a look when you get a moment. There were no big issues there; I just thought the second sentence a bit unnatural. You did a great job in describing the eye in further detail than in the desc, and your command of the English language is very impressive even for a Brit! Well done! `-Cristina

      <desc>Glaring out from above the steel door of a cell, this gargantuan eye is the 
epitome of grotesque - a hard thing to stare at for more than a few seconds 
at a time.  With most of its surface the yellow tinge of jaundice, the 
unhealthy-looking organ is blotched with dark-red streaks.  Its iris burns 
angrily, resembling a dancing, scarlet flame that glistens like flecks of 
chipped ruby.  In the centre, from the dilated pupil, a paranoid beam of 
crimson light glowers into the dim corridor, as if desperately waiting for 
the moment it can reveal an escaping inmate.  Around the eye, a curious, 
crescent shape has been cut into the wall, with glowing, silver veins 
running along the edges to accentuate the curves of the vile eye.

    <editdraftcomments>Lovely Carole, you have your desc pasted twice in the text of the draft. Since the second version was best, that's the one I edited. There is nothing major to mention, except that you didn't particularly specify the up exit, so I added that for you. Also, I assumed you meant &quot;viridian&quot; instead of &quot;virid&quot; - which my thesaurus does not include. I like this room; especially its colourful aspect! Hugs, Cristina
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please change echo number [0] to: 'A painted man in the stained glass yawns unconcernedly. '
 
2) Please change echo number [1] to: 'Air races down the stairwell, shaking the shoddy masonry.'
 
3) Please change echo number [4] to: 'Humidity rolls in from the northeastern corridor.'
 
4) Please change echo number [5] to: 'Light bounces off the polished, metallic surfaces in the walls.'
 
5) Please change echo number [6] to: 'The wind howls in from cracks in the stained glass.'
 
6) Please change the last echo to: 'A strong gust of air rattles some fragments in the stained glass.'
 
EDS:
 
I've edited all your eds a bit. I particularly liked your ed of the stained glass - as ever, you are extremely descriptive about the people (paintings, statues, figurines) in your rooms. I love that! Hugs, Cristina

      <desc>Although the white, red, and black granite of the eastern door does not 
quite fit in with the general colour pattern of the room, the gilded, 
capped-decorated doorknob suits the stairwell's style very well.  The 
northeastern archway is another story, all intricately-sculpted in the same 
translucent, green stone as the rest of this chamber, and adorned with a 
large, aureate medallion.  On the other side of the jade depths, some bits 
of dark covering belong to the other room this wall borders.  Between these 
two imposing features, a stair is accessible.  A very narrow shaft is dug 
out into this portion of the wall and contained a constricted, revolving 
staircase.  Gold encases the olivine steps; in fact, the metal supports the 
whole structure and provides the railing.  Golden bars even keep down a 
plush, velvet, green carpet.  More of the honey-coloured metal lines the 
bottom of the walls.

      <desc>On closer inspection, the decorated cap is not perfectly attached to the 
globular doorknob.  Using a little strength and maybe a knife as leverage, 
the convex, round piece of metal can be pried off.  The metal used to be 
golden, but over years of use it has become oxidized, especially around and 
on its bas-relief; the sculpture represents a now-black bird.  Almost 
worn-off, small letters form the word, &quot;Coronis.&quot;

      <desc>The stained glass covers the entire western wall.  On its northern side, a 
man in a motley, Harlequin-styled costume leans against the gold frame of 
the window.  In the middle of the frame's upper part, a small plaque 
identifies him as, &quot;Pied Piper of Hamelin.&quot;  Indeed, a flute is stuck in his 
belt like a sword scabbard, though the gold wires securing the instrument 
and belt morsels are slightly bent and allow the pieces to rattle in the 
wind.  The metal is stronger on the southern side, however, where the 
stained glass depicts a beautiful countryside, complete with a joyous brook 
and a blooming copse of trees.  A small, painted village is visible in the 
distance.

      <desc>In the southern part of the stained glass, scratches are easily seen on the 
wires and even on the thicker, tougher overall frame; in fact, the wall too 
has suffered some damage.  Among all the random gouges, right where metal 
and stone meet, a vertical gash, about an inch in length can be mistaken for 
only a shadow, so thin it is.

    <desc>A large, solid, granite door occupies the entire west wall, dominating the 
whole of the room.  A single, enormous, carved piece of sandstone, shaped 
like an anvil, stands in the middle of the room.  It's rune-covered surface 
is partially obscured by a patchwork quilt, indicating a sleeping surface.  
From the south, four holes at the top of the ceiling show where only decayed 
support beams now rest, thin shafts of light being able to penetrate the 
surface around the sleeping area.  The base of the floor is a white stone 
that is speckled with the pepper colours of black and red.

      <desc>Centred in the middle of the room, this anvil-shaped sandstone rock appears to be the sleeping area for the occupant. It's surface is a compilation of different sets of runes, some carved jaggedly into the sleeping base, while other fainter markings dot the neck of the anvil. A patchwork quilt resting on top, it's original colours appearing to be once bright yellow and red, has been dimmed by successive years and now only traces of yellow rise above the monotonous dingy brown.

Large, half-decayed support beams run across the length of the jail cell, their exteriors riddled with the past infestations of termite empires and the smell of rotting wood. A strong light diffuses through the holes as well, their beams providing a meager amount of warmth to the prison cell.

    <editdraftcomments>Dearest Carole, you have here a room that is as usual near-perfect. One thing I'd like to comment on, however, is the fact that this room in particular was a bit muddled. Now I know you, Carole, and I've seen your rooms time and time again, so I can safely say that I know you're a lot clearer than that. As ever, I draw your attention against using things like: &quot;former&quot;, &quot;latter&quot;, and brackets, but also expressions like &quot;hole of an archway&quot;, which is difficult to imagine, since it suggests that the archway is a solid material in which a hole has been dug, but the hole meets its dead end in the back of the archway, which is not so. I did very much like the &quot;urine-tainted glass&quot;. Yuck, truly an Azkaban touch! Hugs, Cristina
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Almost everything is perfect here; you just have to add a comma after &quot;sputter&quot;, to make the phrase a bit clearer. Hugs, Cristina

    <desc>A ghastly odour, like that of burnt flesh, fills every centimetre of this 
large cell. Huge cobwebs drape threateningly from the vaulted ceiling. A 
nine-foot long, square window makes up the top-most part of the eastern 
wall. Claw marks, blood, and fingernails litter the wall below the window as 
though previous captures had attempted to reach the stain-glass portrait. 
The floor is nothing more than layer upon layer of medium-brown dirt. A pair 
of huge, French doors, made of thick metal and outlined with silver bolts, 
leads west to a downward stairwell.

    <editdraftcomments>Hey :) I really enjoyed this room!  It's written quite darkly, which suits 
this cell perfectly.  The biggest change I made was I included your last 
sentence into a previous, more similar area, of your desc.  It flows better 
this way, as you're already talking about the markings, so it just makes 
sense to also include that other part there :) if you have any concerns, as 
always, please yell :) 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Your echoes are just dandy here, and all of your eds are peachy, except I 
did edit your black cloak one.  I just want to mention, please don't be 
repetitive in your writing.  It can get dull if one hears over and over 
again, &quot;cloak&quot;, &quot;cloak&quot;, &quot;cloak&quot;, &quot;stone floor&quot;, &quot;stone floor&quot;, etc.  Mix it 
up a bit!  Use a thesaurus!  It's your best friend, let me tell you ;) so 
yes, I did change a few of your words just to liven things up so they don't 
get redundant.  `-mira

    <editdraftcomments>Wow, well done on teaching me what parging means! Ok, so I edited this room. No major errors, just the regular tweaks. Please have a look though, and note me if you think anything's wrong. Much love, Cris
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
Please change echo number [2] to: 'The light glances off the eye of the metallic fireback-bound dragon.'
 
EDS:
 
I've edited your ed. Please add dragon to the keywords. Otherwise, this is golden, and may I ask if you're going to have a quest here? That handle smells like one, anyway :P Much love, Cris

      <desc>The fireplace is pretty plain in design, but huge in size: wide and tall 
enough to roast a whole deer in.  In fact, on each inner side, a Y-shaped, 
iron bar reaches up five feet, and may have been used to hold a gigantic 
skewer right above the smouldering, constant fire.  The hint of sulphur in 
the air, as well as the reddish colours of the flare, indicate a Gubraithian 
fire.  The hearth itself is dark; though originally covered in the same, 
whitish parging as the rest of the mantelpiece, soot has doused it in a 
dirty, dark-grey hue.  Oddly enough, the fireback is devoid of the smut.  
The iron sheet bears a carving of a Chinese Fireball, if the snub-mouth, 
bulging eyes, and spikes are any indication.  From its nostrils blow two 
mushroom-shaped flames, one being moulded in relief and forming somewhat of 
a door handle.  On the horizontal part of the mantel, a collection of desert 
rose adds just a tiny touch of grace to the room.

    <desc>This cell is six foot by six foot, with hard blue marble walls that slope 
gradually up 15 feet to a four foot by four foot ceiling.  The floor is made 
of a hard wood, much like the decking of an old sailing ship, which has been 
worn smooth.  Around the edge of the floor is a one foot wide rut, made by a 
former inmate who whiled away his hours in Azkaban by pacing around the 
room.  There is no bed, just a foul smelling blanket in one of the corners.  
The ceiling has two large holes in it, leading to the outside, giving the 
person within little shelter from the elements.  A constant drip can be 
heard, but no source can be seen.  The only entrance is a 1 foot square trap 
door to the west.

    <desc>The worn staircase is made of scuffed, red brick, and moves on in a steady 
pattern, save for one step, which appears to be missing a brick or two. The 
dusty floor below is barely visible through the gap. Along the walls are 
pewter torches, emblazoned on the rim with a capital &quot;A&quot; and giving off a 
pale, dim light. The strong scent of alcohol and musk hangs in the air. A 
set of stairs to the northwest leads downward, while to the south is a 
plain, stone passageway. A large, hefty, wooden door bars the way southwest. 
The stairs lead upward, to a new level.

through which a small animal may enter or exit. A thick, wooden door is the 
only exit, and it leads northeast.

    <desc>The floor of this corridor is molded out of smooth cobblestone, stained with 
mud and blood of ages past.  The single torch in the room offers an 
extremely dim, flickering light.  The walls are smooth, thick, and grimy 
with the dirt tracked by centuries of murky fingers against its surface.  
Everything is cold to the touch.  The narrow passageway is completely 
sealed, with not a chip or a hole in sight.  A stairwell lies a distance 
away to the north, while to the southwest stretches a corridor almost 
identical to the present one.

    <desc>The walls of this cramped room glow a faint, sickly green, the light 
emanating from the pale stone itself.  The floor and ceiling are tiled in 
dark terracotta, a relief from the eerie phosphorescent stone.  In the 
northeast corner, a few of the floor tiles have been broken.  A slab of 
stone in the northwest corner is clearly intended to serve as a bed.  The 
walls around the sleeping area have been discolored and defaced, perhaps in 
an attempt to dim their glow, perhaps to impart a message in the scribbles.  
The only exit is in the south wall; a heavy, iron-bound door.

    <editdraft>The red brick stairs curve upwards towards the northwest.  The walls are 
narrow, only allowing one body through at a time, and covered in grime.  
Torches line the walls and follow the stairs upwards, each a meter apart 
from the last.  The glow they give casts shadows in the nooks and grooves of 
the bricks, illuminating all imperfections.  The air smells cleaner than the 
rest of Azkaban, due to the window high on the wall.  It is clear of dust 
and dirt because it's too high up for spiders and vermin.  It allows the 
biting wind to sweep through the hallway, and on a particular strong gust, 
the grime coating the stairwell floats down the stairs.  On the wind rides 
the faintest scent of the prisoners below and the sounds of their misery.

They are engraved with a strict, straight edged A, which is darker than the

wear off and the once strong, brilliant flames are now reduced to 
flickering, quivering smatterings of dull heat.

    <desc>Carved figures protrude from the wall to the north, their mouths open as if 
screaming in silent torment.  A baby juts out further than the rest of 
group, with limbs spread.  It dangles near the ceiling of the corridor, with 
its tiny arms stretched out.  The stone slab in which these creatures of 
anguish reside is oddly warm and damp to the touch.  Drops of water trickle 
from the eyes of an unmoving, young girl, leaving two pale-green lines of 
residue.  There is a trace of iron in the walls.  A narrow trail of smooth 
rock dips in the centre of the overused walkway; the outer edges are still 
rough and slightly jagged.  The walls soundlessly cry into the stillness of 
the stagnant air.  A single candle has been left burning on the calloused

      <desc>This candle was left on the rough surface of the walkway. The flame is unnaturally steady in its burn, accompanied only by a slow melting of the wax; the wick is all but spent. The minimal light that it provides casts eerie shadows on the people trapped in the walls. The stone inhabitants carved faces become more alive in the crude lighting.

The solid pupils of the baby?s eyes stare blankly at the opposite wall, as if in a trance.  The small mouth hangs open and its tongue is resting on the roof, with no evidence of teeth.

    <desc>Three dangling chandeliers made of Australian crystal sway gracefully from 
the slanted ceiling on gleaming red hooks.  Beams of yellow light reflect 
off every surface, making the corridor appear large, though it is very 
narrow.  Neat, arm length strips of smooth-looking glass cover the long 
stretch of walls.  The floor of the corridor consists of millions of broken 
mirror pieces, crushed from heavy footfall.  Above, the ceiling is decorated 
with intricately carved dimples that sweep over the long expanse.  Following 
the blinding light, there are three choices of departure.  To the south lies 
a hall of darkness and foreboding, while to the southeast, the path is not 
nearly as dim.  Turning in the opposite direction, to the northeast, the way 
is less distinguishable, but rather ominous.

grounded, glass dust.  The crunching of shoes on the surface echoes off the 
walls; and every footstep is audible.  If scraped with a shoe, the sound 
produced resembles that of a body being dragged across rough cement.

      <desc>Chandeliers Dangling Australian Crystal Candelabra Candelabrum Each 
chandelier contains fifty-seven diamond shaped crystals held together by 
hooks made of red glass.  These hooks provide the only colour in the room.  
The light fixtures hang from the mirrored ceiling by the largest hooks and 
produce an amazing wattage of luminosity.  When the light catches the subtle 
edges of the hooks, each surface, though bright, appears blood-streaked.  
The corridor is rather blinding and warm with light.

carvings runs down the entirety of the glass; not a single seam is present.

    <desc>.   A square fifteen feet, this cell is very open. The ceiling is an 
astounding thirteen feet, and hanging from it are a number of cobwebs. The 
stone block walls are windowless, and the only source of light is a single 
torch which burns brightly from the wall. The bottom-most layer of the floor 
is stone, like the walls, though a layer of dirt and grime shields it from 
view. There is a dent in the floor where it is assumed a prisoner slept for 
a very long time. There are small scratch marks on the ceiling as if made by 
a small claw. The only exit is northwest, through a wooden door, to a 
corridor.

north; another such archway leads to the southwest.  Between these three 
exits, a large, revolving stairwell takes up most of the space and makes 
crossing the room a feature reserved for thin people: at least a prisoner 
trying to escape would be slow down here, and would probably scrape 
themselves on the greyish plaster.  Indeed, the matter covering the walls,

    <editdraftcomments>Dearest Carole, I like the elements in this room, but the build-up is a bit erratic to my eye. I've rearranged the sentences a little bit; gimme a beep though if you want to rephrase some other way. Also, I did not see any lighting anywhere -- please remember that you need to write any light sources that might be present in indoor rooms! Much love, Cris
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please change echo number [0] to: 'Screams echo from a general northwestern direction.'
 
2) Please change echo number [2] to: 'Scraping sounds reach out from the shadows.' I wasn't sure what 'grate' meant in this phrase, which is why I changed it.
 
Other than that, you're golden. thank you for working so much and so well for this project; we wouldn't survive without you! Much love, Cris

    <editdraftcomments>Lovely Carole, you've got the writing of details down to an art. I love the way you make this corridor visible with so few words. However, particularly towards the end I got the feeling that this room could use a bit more atmosphere, not only description. I added the sentence between brackets as an indication, but as ever, you can rephrase as you like. Also, while there is a torch in one of your echoes, there are none in the actual text of the desc. Please change that, as indoor rooms must always have any sources of light actually described. Much love, Cris
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please change echo number [0] to 'Smoke billows from a waning torch.'
 
2) Please change 'tremors' to 'trembles' or 'shivers', as 'tremors' strikes me as a bit too heavy for something as fine as dust.
 
Thank you so much for everything you're doing! You are a jewel! `-Cris

another hall, while the other end curves the northeast into darkness.  Long 
torches sit on either side of the passage, providing ample light to the 
small area and filling it with the scent of smoke.  The large stones of the 
floors and walls fit together roughly, like patchwork.  Some slabs are 
pressed tightly together so they seem to be one, while large gaps stand 
between others; in some places they press together at uneven heights so that 
bumps jut out to trip careless passersby.  The rocks themselves are dark, 
and coarse and warm to the touch.  Along the eastern wall a spotted, faded 
brown trail runs along the floor.

    <desc>This short, sharply bent hallway connects the southeast stairwell to the 
corridor from the southwest.  A three-foot expanse of the otherwise-curving 
southern wall is flat where a dark door leads into a cell.  The passage is 
narrow, unlit except for the light shared by its neighbors.  Large, rough 
stones cobble the walls and floor; in the darkness, it is impossible to see 
what makes up the ceiling.  A missing stone creates a hole near the floor 
across from the door and the hole plays host to a family of rats.  The walls 
are worn and crumbling, leaving pebbles and dirt to cover the floor.  No 
drafts or breezes blow through this narrow corridor and the air has a warm, 
dusty taste.  High above, the bottom half of a spider web occasionally 
glimmers as it catches the faint light, the top half lost to the shadows.

The steps and supporting column are plastered with a rough, barbed, greyish

    <desc>Small white spikes protrude from grimy cement walls.  The shoddy brown 
plaster looks as though it does nothing to secure the talon-like teeth into 
place.  A multitude of cracks splatter the surface like the slimy wrinkles 
of an over-used brain.  As if adorned with horizontal stalactites, the 
small, white teeth adhere to the wall at random.  Ruby-coloured stains taint 
the lower positioned spines, while the upper most glisten with neglect.  At 
the entrance of this narrow passageway, the presence of teeth is sparse, 
although most are browned with dried blood.  Towards the centre of the hall 
the formation is noticeably denser.  To an unsuspecting passerby, the

    <editdraftcomments>Hey allison :) just my usual tweaks here and there.  You wrote this desc

    <editfirstcomments>Okay, again I'm putting in my 2 cents.
Here is my version:
`M  Small white spikes protrude from grimy cement walls.  (1)The shoddy brown plaster looks as though it does nothing to secure the talon-like teeth into place.  A multitude of cracks splatter the surface like the slimy wrinkles of an over-used brain.  As if adorned with horizontal stalactites, the small(2), white teeth adhere to the wall at random.  (3)Ruby-coloured stains taint the lower positioned (4)spines, while the upper most glisten with neglect.  At the entrance of this narrow passageway, the presence of teeth is sparse, although most are browned with dried blood.  Towards the centre of the hall the formation is noticeably denser.  To an unsuspecting passerby, the hallway appears rather harmless; however, the motionless walls spring to life the moment anything living passes.  Trying to escape only leads to more (5)blood-sucking punctures as one tries in vain to reach the north and southeast exits.(6)`X
1, plaster needs an article, sorry.  The poetic side of me kept wanting me to leave it alone, but it still rankled me too muchthose pesky articles.  =)
 
2, need a comma separating small and white.  'The' is also considered an adjective, thus needing a comma to separate the 3 adjectives 'the', 'small', and 'white'.
 
3,&quot;Ruby coloured&quot; should be &quot;Ruby-coloured&quot; since it is a compound modifier.
 
4, I used the word spines (meaning: a stiff, pointed process or appendage on an animal, as a quill of a porcupine, or a sharp, bony ray in the fin of a fish) since the word teeth is being used over and over again.  Unfortunately, for this desc and this word, there aren't too many substitutions for the word teeth, and you need teeth to have this deliciously 'evil' room, but I'm trying to shake things up a bit, nonetheless. =)
 
5, &quot;blood sucking&quot; should be &quot;blood-sucking&quot;, like in #3.
 
6,  That whole last sentence I'm not sure about  Well, A, I love the sentence and I love the freaking idea!  B, the however is- this means we have to create this room to literally take health points (weaken) from the players for this to be true.  Is that your ultimate goal?  And, if so, make sure you make a note about it somewhere to make sure we see it when we move these rooms to the new engine.  C, I went ahead and changed &quot;the victims&quot; to &quot;one&quot; since the reader of this room will be one of these in this 'trapping' room.  In other words, the player is an animate creature, thus when s/he moves through, the walls will spring to life.  At that point 'the victims' is impersonal since this player is now one of these so-called victims.  Using 'one' keeps it generic enough.
 
Ed teeth
 
`mWhen launched, the teeth wedge into soft flesh and immediately start to feed through the small holes at the ivory tips.  The teeth tear away as (1)victims break into a panicked sprint causing the nerves to retract with the elasticity of a rubber band.  Frantic (2)hollow-sucking sounds are replaced by the gurgling squelch of the teeth settling back into place.  A cheap,(3) but effective, trick of a clever vampire to bewitch the false teeth to do its dirty work.`X
 
1, as in the desc, I've altered this to be more generic so that the player can be included into thisif kept the original way it gives the impression that the player is 'outside' of the room as opposed to actually being 'inside' the room.
 
2, &quot;hollow sucking&quot; should be &quot;hollow-sucking&quot;
 
3, this last sentence was fragmented, thus my making it into a whole sentence.
 
Allison, wow.  Wow.  Wow.  This room ROCKS!!!  You need tweaking in the grammar arena, but you're a world-class builder.  My hat is off to you; I bow before your masterful imagery.  `-tina

    <desc>From the centre of the octagonal-shaped, vaulted ceiling descends an 
imposing, revolving stair.  However, limber ivy, spindly roses, and thick 
nettles have embedded their roots in self-created cracks, crushing a part of 
the great edifice; the plants have also dug holes in the stone walls and 
ceiling, allowing daylight to come in.  The base of the stair subsists, 
though jagged and shrouded in a greyish wax, and descends into a down-below 
room.  The waxy substance is by no means chaotic, arranged as it is on the 
stone beam in large hexagons; some of it also soils part of the walls, 
having dripped heavily down.  No solid way between this column and the 
ragged, broken platforms to the north and southeast have survived; only 
ropes create unsteady bridges to the two archways.  The only who ignore this 
problem are the furry, grey insects that visit the wax and the neighbouring, 
perfumed nettles.

    <editdraftcomments>Dearest Carole, the room is wonderfully detailed. I loved the description and the way you leave from the image of the staircase and then go into the surroundings. I have, however, added a few more details, to make the room have a bit more atmosphere. Tell me if you think I've done anything wrong. Much love, Cris

    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Echo number [0]: Please remove the hyphen between 'down' and 'below'; it's not necessary and looks somewhat strange in this sentence.
 
2) Echo number [1]: Please add &quot;A&quot; before &quot;ray of daylight&quot; here.
 
3) Echo number [4]: Please remember that you only name the insects in an ed, therefore the readers are assumed to have read only the desc. Please change the echo to something like: 'Tiny, furry insects fly around haphazardly.'

      <desc>The furry insects can be identified as Glumbumbles; they are known for 
feeding on nettles, producing a melancholy-inducing treacle, and being 
something of a cousin to bees.  The wax they secrete hardens to steel-like 
solidity; this, added to the large size of the hexagons, means the wax 
covering the remnants of the stairs can be used to climb down into another

      <desc>Silvery marble composes the entire surface of the walls, ceiling, and stair; 
no joint is visible at all, as if a single, humongous stone had been carved 
into this room and deposited here, on top of Azkaban prison.  The light 
mineral beautifully contrasts with the dark-green and blood-red of the 
roses, the tender-grass hue of the nettles, and the large, olive leaves of 
the ivy.  The plants have sunk their roots into the hard stone and wandered 
all around the room; however, how the hard rock can nourish and allow them 
to blossom all year long is mysterious, though most probably magical.

1)Echo number [0]: Please change this echo to: 'A dozen globes all flash at the same time in a glorious, dazzling firework.'
 
2) Echo number [1]: Please change 'huddles' to 'huddle' please. Also, and this is only a suggestion, I would change 'their faint buzzing like conspirators' whispers' to 'their faint buzzing like the whispers of unknown conspirators.'
 
3) Echo number [2]: please add 'a' before 'complex' here.
 
The echoes here are scrumptious, girl! I love them. `-Cristina

    <editfirst>Three tall, narrow archways form vertices to this constricted, triangular 
room.  The one to the south permits thick, perfumed nettles and red, thorny 
roses to slip in, while the southeastern arch is blocked by a 
reinforced-steel door.  The last, northeastern passageway is completely bare 
and simply displays silvery, smooth marble to whomever might glance that 
way.  Watermelon-sized globes of frosted glasses hover haphazardly in this 
slip of a corridor, bursting every now and again in silvery or dark-grey 
flashes so sudden and violent they seem able to pierce through flesh and 
bone alike.

    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Echo number [0]: a murmur wouldn't 'rattle' the sarcophagus, particularly if it's that heavy. Perhaps something subtler like: 'A muffled murmur sinisterly permeates through the sarcophagus.'

I've had a look at the ed and edited it. Most of the edits were misspellings, so I am reminding you please to run your writing through a word processor before pasting it here. Much love, Cris

      <desc>This sarcophagus seems to be made out of gold.  Inlaid stones on the top 
depict the face and silhouette of a young maiden with black hair and eyes, 
high cheekbones, and full lips.  On the sides is depicted the entire journey 
of the soul into the Egyptian Afterworld, including the several steps of the 
Judgement ceremony that decides if the soul deserves paradise.

    <editdraftcomments>Dear Carole, I like this desc very much. More than anything though, I love the last part about the gases and the crosses. Still, I would love to see more detail here, like an ed of the burial place. I also edited the last part of the last sentence, but that's only a suggestion. Feel free to rephrase and send me a note about it. Much love, Cristina

      <desc>The thinness of the layer of earth, only one metre, easily explains why so 
many corpses are only half-buried.  The soil feels greasy under the touch, 
almost like human ashes, and it is viscid with decaying remnants; as it is, 
this ground would be a perfect place to grow some flowers, if it were not 
for the obsession of the prison staff to tear away any vegetal invader and 
make place in favour of those who don't need it anymore.

      <desc>The wonky and off-centre crosses here intend to mark some tombs; however, 
since they bear no inscription, it's impossible to know who they try to 
identify.  It is often even impossible to tell if the corpse lies left or 
right of the landmark, or if the body is even still here.  Crumbling bones, 
rotting flesh, and decaying rags do not give much more indication, as oft 
the few visible remains are not arranged in the normal shape of a human body 
- even when they are human.  Instead, the bits are flung all over the area 
after the haphazard digging of yet another tomb.

    <editdraft>All three exits are blocked respectively by a gossamer veil to the 
southwest, a midnight-blue, velvet curtain to the north, and a heavy, wooden 
door to the northwest.  In-between, the floor is covered by a foul-smelling 
mist and feels spongy under the foot.  High, stiff mushrooms poke out of the 
fog; while these fungi hinder progression, they also provide light to the 
corridor in the form of a pale, moon-light like glow.  The walls, ceiling 
and wooden door are painted midnight blue, dwarfing the size of the size of 
the already-narrow corridor.

      <desc>Under the touch, the veil is of the finest silk and seems weightless.  
Dozens of small spiders scuttle across it and reveals its creators; still, 
the material looks like it was spun by humans, while the lower end is 
somewhat shredded, reminding of traditional ghost stories.

      <desc>Upon close inspection, the velvet is interwoven with some metallic, silver 
threads.  This gives a very light shimmer to the curtain, and also a lot of 
weight so that it is not easily displaced neither by the wind or by hand.

    <desc>This medium-sized cell has walls probably about twelve feet in length, and 
no more than seven feet in width.  The colour of the once white walls is now 
a dark yellow with patches of grime covering them.  The walls are 
disturbingly colourful - small portions of mould protrude here and there, 
along with large smudges of something that looks like dried blood.  A sick 
smell lingers in the air, reeking of moths; in the corner of the northern 
wall under the cover of dimmed light, a colony of moths has built its nest.  
Lots of small, yellowish larvae crawl around while dozens of dead moths and 
their torn wings adorn the filthy floor.  The only light comes from the 
corridor outside and the only exit lies to the southeast in the shape of a 
large wooden door.

    <editdraftcomments>Hey kristina :) overall good room here, I like everything you creatively put 
in.  Just a few comments.  Firstly, you never want to say &quot;this is a cell&quot;.  
Instead, let your description tell the reader that ;) and I eliminated 2 
small portions of your draft because they were extra fluff that distracted 
from your otherwise nice wording :) hope you don't mind.  And please don't 
forget we use british spelling here!  (color thus becomes colour) I know, I 
know.  Silly brits.  They like their extra u's.  :) 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>In echo #1, I believe damped should be dampened?  That makes more sense to 
me.  Otherwise you're golden here, thanks!  `-mira

    <desc>This room looks mostly like a cocoon, as it's draped in large, silvery 
cobwebs.  Even the exits to the northwest and northeast are partially 
blocked out by ethereal veils; lights from the rooms beyond make the 
curtains glow, while air drafts sometimes ruffle them.  Between these 
passages there is only a narrow, spider-web-spun rope bridge.  About 
half-way through it, a similarly-spun, rope ladder leads down.  Speech and 
occasional murmurs identify any black, hand-sized spiders that roam about as 
Acromantulas, though much of the sound is muffled by the thick silk.

    <editdraftcomments>I've just made a few tiny adjustments here. Awesome idea about the bridge and the ladder halfway through -- it's very creepy and eerie. Much love, Cris
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>1. Please change: Acromentula to Acromantula in echoes [0], [4], and [6]. 
 
2. Please change echo [1] to: 'A harsh gale almost tears down the veils covering the exits.'
 
3. Yigh about echo [2]. Creepy. Please change 'murmurs' to 'murmur' though.
 
4. Please move 'blinks' after 'light' in echo [7].
 
5. Just a suggestion: you could change 'as if in' to 'as though in'. Just sounds better, by my ear. :D
 
Much love, Cris

flying, crawling, or digging irregular hexagons of a waxy, dirty-yellow 
substance.  The alveoli are oozing a kind of syrupy treacle, that closes 
around, or shelters larvae.  The honeycombed structure covers most of the 
greyish walls; some lumpy chunks have fallen off, however, flattening some 
of the nettles that otherwise carpet the floor.  Even the northeastern door, 
and the veiled, northern and southeastern archways bear some of the greyish

    <editdraftcomments>I love the idea of the little furry insects here, as I did in one of the previous rooms. I've just edited this desc, and enjoyed it very much. No big things to mention, but please take a look at all that I've changed. Much love, Cristina
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Echo number [1]: I think it is better to change 'conversations' to 'conversation' here.
 
2) Echoes numbers [2], [7]: Please do not mention the name Gumbumbles in the echoes, since it only appears in the eds and not in the main desc.
 
3) Echo number [2]: Please change 'get' to 'gets' here: the subject is singular.
 
4) Echo number [5]: Please change this echo to: 'A larva blinks with its blind, pathetic eyes.'
 
Wonderful work here. I love these echoes, and you've made this room thick with buzzing noises and furry insects! 
 
EDS:
 
I've edited all the eds and I think they are wonderful. Please glance at the edits though, and let me know if I overdid my work. `-Cristina

      <desc>The fresh wax is slightly sticky and malleable, like a kind of plastic clay; 
however, it hardens to steel-like solidity when left long enough alone.  The 
lumps on the floor are great at both tripping the unwary passer-by and 
getting surprised feet stuck.  When hardened in a very thin sheet, the wax 
is also slippery.  Walking through this room without stumbling is quite a 
feat; to add to the slipperiness and sharpness of the floor, the nettles 
make the surface an enormous trap.

    <desc>This cell is exceptionally baleful, dank, and arctic.  The floors and walls 
are made of dull, wet, moss-covered granite.  The ceiling is the only part 
of this room not covered in moss.  The ceiling is exactly eight feet above 
the moist floor.  The only ray of light comes from a tiny, rectangular 
window cut very crudely into the solid oak door.  The rectangular light 
pierces the room resting on a spot about two feet above what appears to be 
some kind of bed.  The light has no exact source, as if it were magical and 
always there.  The light reveals tick marks left by a former prisoner.  The 
tick marks have a tiny inscription under them.  The bed is only a board held 
up with a rusty chain on each side; it looks as if it has not been used in a 
long time.  The only way out of this room is unfortunately the only way in, 
to the south.  There is not a single window anywhere in this cold dark room.

    <desc>This room is being worked on by Allison/Starlight
</desc>
    <editdraft>Windowless and dry, this corridor is flanked with rough wooden panels.  The 
smell of pine lingers in the cool air.  A small breeze flows in from the 
south exit where there is a small beam of light.  No other light is afforded 
in this pitch-black portion of the hall, as a vampire has no need for light. 
 Those who enter must run their hand against the walls to find their way 
through.  The corridor is silent aside from the hollow sound of footsteps 
and breathing of the path-taker.  Halfway through the passageway, an object 
that feels like a stone drinking fountain is affixed to the wall.  When 
touched, the fountain automatically spouts liquid.  From the northeast, a 
rancid smell wafts through the air where another ill-omened area lies.

      <desc>The smell of pine engulfs the corridor in a faux winter smell.  Working to 
calm those who enter, the scent allows the mind to relax without suspecting 
danger.  Surrounded by darkness, the unsuspecting walker uses a hand to 
guide their way through the hall.  The roughness of the wood easily sends 
splinters into the soft pads of fingertips while a pale figure approaches 
from behind.  Distracted by the painful splinters, the walker does not hear 
the soft footsteps behind them.  The wooden walls were put up for more than 
calming the mind; they are also highly effective for muting screams.

    <desc>A faint light from a single torch illuminates this dark and lonely corridor. 
 The floor seems to be newly built, the dark, polished tiles triangular in 
shape.  A small, window-sized opening, probably a ventilator, exists on the 
blocked, northern wall, through which a faint breeze emanates every now and 
again.  A south-eastern exit is covered by a black veil, leading to a steep 
stairwell.  This corridor continues towards the southwest, in all its gloomy 
emptiness.  The only eye-catching entity is the huge, triangular, metal door 
to the south.

    <editdraftcomments>This is really a great room, Surabhi! I love the way you started the desc, setting the scene; the first sentence is really awesome! Thank you SO much for your hard work! Much love, Cris

    <editeds>ECHOES: 
 
Your echoes are awesome. No objection here!
 
EDS:
 
Please add 'south' to the list of keywords of your ed. I edited the text of the ed a little bit, so please check that out when you get the chance. In particular, I wanted to draw your attention to the last sentence. I wasn't entirely sure whether you wanted those markings to be 'inch deep'  or 'mere scratches', because it can't be both, but I chose for the inch-deep approach, as it's more dramatic.  
 
Much love, Cris

    <desc>This small room is in the shape of a cone, with a circular floor area and 
smooth, pale walls sloping to a point high overhead.  The floor is ringed 
with an intricate, unbroken border of engraved runes and glyphs.  The dim, 
blue glow that lights the room emanates from these intricate carvings.  The 
only exit is a dark triangle to the south: no door is visible, but thin 
threads of sapphire light, growing out of yet more symbols by the door, 
prevent passage.

    <desc>Lightless, except for occasional, dark-grey gleams that erupt every so often 
from the rough, stone walls, the cell appears distorted in ever-changing 
shapes that create monstrous, fugitive shadows through the thick darkness.  
Anger and despair hang heavily in the air, abetted by the eerie moans and 
wails that somehow stream inside, mixed with the scent of sweat and 
excretions.  Long chains hang down from the centre of the chamber, with two 
shackles at the ends places high enough to keep a tall man standing on 
tip-toes.  Straw and humid hay slouch in a pile in one corner, crawling with 
parasites; the mound probably once served as a bed to a restless, tormented 
occupant, whose markings line the four stone walls and the floor of the 
small, windowless cell.  In the outbursts of the faint, silvery light, 
entire messages dyed dark-red can be seen etched within the stone.  A door 
of reinforced steel stands south.

      <desc>The words 'Innocent' and 'Thirsty' are written obsessively on every wall, 
often in large, diagonal strips, framed by deep fingernail traces that must 
have taken a very long time to dig.  A vague attempt at counting days of 
imprisonment can be seen upon the floor, between broken fragments of straw 
and dents in the stone surface.  Pieces of a solid material, presumably 
bone, lie scattered around, especially in the humid corners of the room.  
Entire patches of matted hair are stuck to the walls, with the aid of 
considerable amount of congealed blood, in a pathetic attempt of an artistic 
pattern.

      <desc>Heavy steel reinforces the lock of the impenetrable-looking door.  Its 
hinges are dark-red from the many times that blood has been spilled on them, 
while salty traces of, presumably, tears coat its surface.  The 
slightly-darker contour of a head and a strong pair of shoulders can be seen 
against the steel surface, probably from the many times that its occupant 
has collapsed against it.

      <desc>Straw and hay are scattered all over the cell, often broken into very fine 
fragments, with large numbers of parasites swarming atop and beneath them.  
Some of the straws show signs of brutal vandalizing, as they're spread 
against the walls, sticking together in sorry heaps bound by urine, blood, 
or human hair.

      <desc>The chains show signs of rare usage, although they are tight enough to 
painfully dig into a prisoner's wrists whenever they restrain someone.  No 
rust has settled upon the device, but the insides of the shackles are fully 
coated with dried blood, as though the person imprisoned in them had 
struggled in vain to defeat his defencelessness.

    <desc>Upon entering this room, one would be falling straight down for a very short 
while until met with the walls intersecting at a sharp dip.  Eight slates of 
white and black marble tilt towards each other at pointed angles, forming a 
cubic rhombus of some sort, make up this chamber.  Each wall is slender and 
squat, causing this cell to be cramped and damp with no leg room or space to 
stand comfortably.  There is only one exit: a small hole at the topmost 
point of an intersection of walls which diminishes in size with each attempt 
to move through it.  A bright, blinding light emits from the break in the 
walls, filling everything with the intolerable brightness that echoes off 
all the sides of the room.

    <editdraftcomments>Heya shanti!  :) overall pretty good room here.  Just a few tweaks as you 
used the word room a lot and I didn't want things to get repetitive, so I 
exchanged some out for new terms.  There was just 1 spelling error, and I 
re-worded the ending since you mentioned &quot;wall&quot; in the same sentence twice.  
I like the imagery you use here though, I can actually picture this cell 
quite clearly in my head!  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Everything seems ok here, except you have the echo placed twice.  Not sure 
why :P one runs from 2am-4am, and the other 2am-3pm...  So please remove one

intersection of walls in the room.  Barely visible or noticed is the depth 
of the walls shown through this crack - the opening seems to be at least a 
few inches deep, but beyond that all that can be seen is a white light that 
pierces the eye and could burn through flesh with its brightness alone.  
This gap is rougly the shape of an ellipse, but contains a few tangent cuts 
that suggest it being quickly carved by hand, not wand.

    <editdraftcomments>Hey shanti!  :) so sorry it's taken me ages to get to your room, but I was 
in a mix of taking a break, and furiously trying to train 9 new people!  
Anyway, overall I think your room is ok.  Just a few tweaks.  1 comment: 
your last word, shiver, are you sure you mean shiver?  I thought you might 
have wanted it to be shimmer, since you mention reflection and illumination. 
 But shiver would be ok since we're in azkaban, I'm just double checking.  
Oh!  And yes.  Word didn't like your use of harpacked.  It didn't register 
it as a word.  Are you positive this is correct?  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>I would love to have some comments for you here, but you forgot to add in an 
echo or ed!  :) please do so, and let me know when you have so I can peek at 
it before clearing you with the room.  Thanks so much!  `-mira 
 
 
everything seems fit here :) thanks for adding those in, shanti `-mira

    <editfirstcomments>No problem, mira!  You diserve a break, you work so hard!  Anyway, what can 
I do to make it better than ok?  For the &quot;shiver/shimmer&quot; thing, I'm really 
not sure what I meant when I wrote that, so I'll go along with you and put 
shimmer.  =D Now, as for harpacked, I meant &quot;hardpacked,&quot; but apperantly the 
dictionary doesn't think THAT is a word, so I'll change it to &quot;compressed.&quot;  
Sound good?  Thank you so much for editing!  -shanti oh, and I forgot to 
say, I edited a few bits because some of the wording didn't sound right, 
such as &quot;thrown across the earth floors...  Firmly attached to the floor...&quot; 
 Etc.  I hope you don't mind.  =D

      <desc>A large, almost human sized mirror is hanging here, framed by elaborate 
carvings of stone, and suspended with a thick, molding piece of rope.  Each 
section of stone is sculpted into a dagger tilted at an odd angle, harshly 
piercing a soft, almost flesh-like surface.  The stretch of glass stands but 
a half metre from the ground, and is twinkling with the reflection of a

looking glass.  Within, one can see themself only at their worst moments, 
whether it be a moment etched into memory such as the turning point from 
good to evil, or a time one could only imagine in the most horrible of 
nightmares, like the death of the only one who ever cared, or worse, one's 
self sprawled on the floor in a lifeless hump.

      <desc>A small, crudely formed box of metal sits here, holding a small candle 
within it's confines.  The dim light only emits a limited amount of 
brightness - alone, it could not illuminate the vast, stone room.  However, 
the surrounding mirrors give assistance, reflecting each lamp and sending 
streams of lights to various corners of the room, giving the room a 
shimmering effect.

    <desc>This long, low room is made more for the pacings of a restless wolf than for 
a man.  The ceiling is six feet high and the room is only four feet wide, 
but it stretches twenty feet long.  The remnants of a thin, narrow mattress 
sit at the south end, but the innards of the mattress are spread throughout 
the cell.  Like the mattress itself, the bits of stuffing are crawling with 
fleas and lice.  The carcasses of countless bugs litter the floor.  A thick, 
heavy door lies to the north, strong enough that a werewolf could not 
destroy it or force it open.  It is not well fitted to the frame around it 
and light from the corridor beyond leaks through, casting thin beams across 
the chamber.  Revealed in patches by the light, the once smooth, grey 
cobbled stones of the walls and floor are now scratched, chipped, and gouged 
from the full moon rampages of previous prisoners.  Lacking windows or 
torches, the cracks around the door provide the only light that finds its 
way into the room.

      <desc>For such a small mattress, there is a great deal of shredded stuffing.  It 
lies in clumps around the cell, matted and filthy.  The mattress itself is 
in several pieces and is now little more than scraps of thick material.

      <desc>The living bugs outnumber the dead ones, but not by a lot.  The fleas and 
lice swarm the mattress and stuffing so thickly that they almost seem alive. 
 Roaches feast on the bodies of their brothers, leaving nothing but the dark 
shells to scatter the floor.  Hardly a step can be taken in this cell 
without a sickening crunch of roaches underfoot accompanying it.

exact same colour as the walls around them.  However, whereas the walls have 
a translucent quality to them, the strange dentelle is a stark red.  
Moreover, six luminous sources have been placed behind the walls; this means 
that in some places, the transparency turns the walls white, while the veins 
appear almost black in the contre-jour.  Also, when the light hits them in

    <desc>This cell is a nice, seven-foot-wide cube.  The entire expanse of the walls, 
floor, ceiling, and even the inside of the eastern, only door, is covered in 
some strange, flesh-coloured, elastic matter; it looks phenomenally like 
human skin.  It even feels sort of alive and almost pulsing under the touch. 
 Walking on it not only feels squashy and weird, it is also kind of 
treacherous: the stuff gives slightly under any weight, and is thick enough 
that the hollow thus created can strain an ankle.  It is mostly like trying 
to walk on a water bed.  The best part of the cell is actually a bed, since 
the drawbacks of the floor carry over into assets for a lying surface, if 
the resemblance to human skin can be overlooked.

    <editdraftcomments>This room is very interesting!  I don't know how all of you builders come up 
with such clever stuff, but I love reading all of these great rooms.  
Anyway, nothing major to report here, just the usual tweaks.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Your first echo is great here.  In echo #1, though, I think it should read: 
For no visible reason, the entire floor caves in a shallow basin, then goes 
back to normal.  And in echo #2, instead of &quot;get in&quot;, maybe put something 
like &quot;can be heard&quot;, as it will make more sense.  :) `-mira

    <editfirstcomments>I just think the last sentence should be &quot;if the resemblance to human skin

    <desc>This cell is barely recognizable as a room; it is impossible to tell how it 
originally looked.  Huge, rugged gashes in the floor make it precarious to 
cross.  The solid stone of the walls has been ripped apart over time, 
bearing deep scars.  The crevices show layer upon layer of claw and bite 
marks, leaving very few smooth patches of the original wall.  In a fissure 
in the west wall is lodged a small, yellowish object that looks suspiciously 
like a tooth.  On the southern wall near the only door, the stump of a 
wooden torch protrudes from the wall.  Its remnants are scattered throughout 
the cell, in the form of splinters.  The presence of shredded, filthy rags 
attests to the existence of a destroyed bed, the splinters of which mix with 
that of the torch.  The only lights in the room are the thin lines around 
the door.  In one corner, water drips through a crack in the ceiling and 
pools in a split in the ground.

    <desc>This chamber is nothing more than a natural cleft in the stark, black rock 
of the island.  The floor is treacherously uneven and riddled with 
tauntingly-dangerous crevices, large enough to turn an ankle.  The walls of 
the cave are jagged and irregular, rising to merge with the stalactites 
piercing the ceiling.  The only respite from oppressive darkness is in the 
sickly glow from clumps of phosphorescent fungus.  A heap of old leaves in a 
natural recess is where other unfortunate occupants of this cell have bedded 
down.  The only visible man-made item is the huge, iron portcullis to the 
southeast, blocking the only visible exit, the cave mouth.

      <desc>The pelts are gorgeous; some are a silvery grey or golden brown, while a 
couple are a rich mahogany colour.  Even if they bear signs of use, the hair 
is still silky to the touch, and shines in the light.  The thick down ont 
the underneath side promises a deep, relaxing sleep.  The only impediment to 
that seems to be the heads.  In fact, a closer look reveals a hairy, 
peculiarly-shaped snout.  The eyes are replaced with coloured glass balls, 
but if they were still in their sockets, they would probably show slitted 
pupils; in fact, their glass replacements do.  The tail would probably be 
tufted if the hair had not been shaved of its end.  Knowing who the usual 
inhabitants of this cell are, makes this a particularly-cruel, gory joke.

Above this wooden obstacle, a torch is set in a simple, yet 
dangerous-looking, silvery metal ring; a stem is dug into the mud and holds 
the thing aloft.  The slightly damp mud is packed into sturdy but also soft 
surfaces, almost like padded walls.  If one was to investigate the said 
dampness and pass a hand over the mud, it would come out covered in a red, 
coppery-smelling substance.

    <desc>The stench of sweat, faeces, and decay hangs thickly in the stale air of the 
small, stuffy, cell.  The deep darkness of the room is only rarely broken by 
the sliver of light allowed in by the tiny hole in the door to the south.  
Scratches and deep slashes have attacked the sturdy, steel-reinforced 
concrete walls so fiercely that the steel jags out from the concrete 
menacingly.  Tufts of short, stubbly hair, often mingled with blood, and 
sometimes still attached to small patches of skin, are littered across the 
cold, stone floor; the only other thing in this barren room is some straw, 
presumably for making some sort of bed.  A solid metal door bars the only 
exit to the south.

      <desc>There are a number of small tufts of short, stubbly hair.  Blood often holds 
the tufts together, although some are also held together by scraps of 
now-decaying skin.  Those tufts that aren't overpowered by the stench of 
blood or decay carry the smell of a filthy dog, desperately needing a bath.

    <desc>This 8 by 8 foot cell is more suited for a large Werewolf than an average 
man.  There is a silver door on the southwest wall, and a 3 foot wide stone 
slab stretches on the wall from the northwest to the southeast corner, being 
used as a bed.  The cell gives off an air of brutality and despair, as if 
the emotions of previous prisoners have never left.  The floor is of cold, 
dark stone with long, deep gashes that zigzag all along the floor, as though 
something were trying to dig their way out.  Throughout the cell, stems of 
Wolfs Bane are scattered along the floor dry and faded purple with age, 
rodents dare not enter the cell for even the very odor of the plant would 
kill them.  The tall walls begin to fade at 10 feet and then expand into a 
perpetual dark, night sky, complete with a large full-moon, which is the 
only source of light.

and big, dark clouds.  A large, silvery full-moon rests in the center, it 
looks so close that you can almost touch it.  As beautiful as the scene is, 
there is something also foreboding about it, the sky itself is a deep 
crimson red and the clouds black, as if a storm is about to unfold.

    <desc>This room resembles a dry well shaft, stone and circular, its only exit far 
overhead on the western wall, a circle of faint grey.  Heavy bars across the 
opening obscure the dim light from above.  Roughly ten feet in diameter, the 
north side of the floor has been worn into a slight hollow, evidently a 
sleeping area.  The stones in the wall are roughly the size of a man's head, 
crudely shaped to follow the curve of the wall.  The grey surfaces are 
coarsely grained, the sort of surface that shreds unwary flesh.  A few dark 
smears hint that such encounters have occurred more than once.  On the 
southern curve of the wall there is a gap two feet above the floor where a 
stone appears to be missing.

    <editdraft>Upon entering through the northern door, fur covers very and any surface.  
The very short, white down makes for a very soft look, a padded protection 
and a muffled sound.  Even the bed is covered with the stuff, and more fur 
are set on it, as a promise of sound, uninterrupted sleep.  Over, under, in 
that overall warm atmosphere, festers a microscopic, albeit unbearable evil: 
fleas.  They can be seen pretty easily, in spite of their size, because of 
their dark colour against the pale down.

    <editdraftcomments>Everything edited is pretty self-explanatory, I believe :) though you're 
welcome to challenge or ask about anything I've changed, as always.

    <editeds>In echo #1, buried should be bury, as we write in present tense here.  In 
echo #2, I think it should be &quot;up from the bed&quot; instead of &quot;from up the bed&quot; 
:P and #3 needs to be capitalized, hehe.  In #4, I think &quot;cheer on two 
others&quot; would make for better clarification here.  And in #5, looks should 
be look, and in #6, form should be from :P #10, looks should be look and 
them I think should be others, for better clarification.  #13 makes no sense 
to me, though, I'm afraid.  You can either fix it, or remove it, whichever 
you like.  #14 will have to have the bed?  S changed to bed's too :) the 
rest is good!  I love how you love a lot of echoes in your rooms, hehe, it

    <editdraftcomments>Wow allison, I'm so impressed by the gruesome ickiness of this room :) it's 
AWESOME!  Hehe.  Well done, my dear.  I only changed your 'center' to 
'centre' as we use british spelling here (silly brits) and put in a few 
comma's in your one sentence that had 3 adjectives.  Lovely disgusting room, 
I wouldn't want to be in here too long because of the stench!  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Allison!  Your eds are creepy and make me squirm!  Hehe.  :) very nice.  
Your echo seems lovely to me, but I did edit all 3 of your eds so please 
have a peek.  Don't forget to use british grEy as well.  (think A for 
Americans, so don't use A!  Lol) `-mira 
 
I've also added onto each ed the changes I think are needed. `-tina
 
The echo needs to be changed to: &quot;A small spider, with thick furry legs, crawls over the sharp blue iris of the eyeball.&quot; as &quot;with thick furry legs&quot; is an adjectival phrase describing the spider.
`-tina
 
I've edited all your eds here, dear, lovely girl. They only needed some minor tweaks though. I've added my edited version at the very end of all eds, so I HOPE it's easy to find them, though some of those eds are pretty big by now. If you don't agree with something though, please feel free to thump me! `-Cristina

    <editfirst>Meticulous rows of lifeless vials and syringes sit with wicked intent.  The 
tiny room reeks of stale vomit and bile.  Rusted buckets line the walls and 
a cobwebbed mop leans abandoned in the corner.  In the cent(re) of the room 
is a small, black, wooden stool.  When in use, the stool serves as a 
kneeling block for the unfortunate interrogated.  Injected with the near

a rusted bucket.  The retching noise reverberates around the small room as 
the interrogator questions his charge.  Facing the corner, the victim cannot

    <editfirstcomments>Allison, the imagery in this room is amazing.  I'm not changing any of the actual descs, but adding to Mira's edits as I have some additional requests and explanations.  Dan and I went over this incredible room and agree on the changes needed, so let me have a go.  :)  I'm not 'changing' the room, as it will need to be checked out again after your changes, instead I'm just listing them for you to alter.
 
1, the word 'stool' is too 'sitty' for it to be used for a kneeling block.  The words &quot;kneeler&quot; or &quot;prie dieu&quot; would be more fitting.  Both are actual words, the 1st one meaning exactly as it says and the prie dieu as a kneeling area with an added prayer/pleading feature.  Or if it's simply easier, just join those 2 sentences mentioning the block.
 
2, change the &quot;with the near toxic serum&quot; to &quot;with near toxic serum&quot;.  This needs to be more generic since you've not actually established which serum this is (hence no 'the') and who knows, there may be many serums.  This also applies to &quot;the victim is forced&quot;, as there is no 'specific' victim.  You need the generic &quot;victims are forced&quot;.
 
3, &quot;the interrogator questions his charge&quot; is an outstanding image, however, isn't kosher for a desc of a room, instead the interrogating person should be mentioned in an echo.   The sentence should just read &quot;victims are forced to vomit wile kneeling uncomfortably over a rusted bucket; the retching noises reverberate around this small room.&quot;
 
4, &quot;corner, the victim cannot&quot; is, again, a specific article when we need a generic 'a' (or victims which takes out the article altogether ), which, by the way, talking about victims not being able to see the exit to the sw is an OUTSTANDING way to mention where the exit is.

It is not difficult to imagine the protocol of an interrogation in this chamber. Stripped naked, any of those questioned here is forced to kneel on the splintering kneeler, as a vomit-inducing serum is injected painfully between the second and third vertebrae of the spine.  When shot with this clear liquid, those interrogated are forced to vomit until only dry heaves are available. There is an antidote on the shelves, though it may be easily supposed that only the interrogator has it. Several, empty vials enforce the thought that the tormenter drips the contents of the vials little by little, with every unanswered question.

`-tina 1, I agree with your &quot;by fire&quot;, Allison instead of Mira's change, 
since a fire has not been established in here.  Is the fire from a 
fireplace, from spells, etc.?  You were right to keep it generic, though 
blackened was misspelled.  :) 2, change stool, as mentioned in your desc 
edit.  3, A, you've not established a specific victim in sentence 3 and 4, 
and B, you have &quot;victim's&quot; and &quot;their&quot; in the final sentence, thus having a 
singular victim and plural their.  Change it to &quot;As a victim shivers with 
cold sweat, the charredStabbing pains shoot through the victims' legs as the

Bellow are my notes. `-tina
 
1, you had 'with' twice in one sentence, when 'from', not only works better in this sentence, but changes the double 'with'.  :)  
 
2, Vapour is the correct British spelling.  
 
3, take out &quot;about 3 inches&quot; as we want strong, assertive words and not passive ones.  Also, the last sentence is a bit abrupt.  Next, dried streams of blood cannot 'drip' as they are dried, making them static and not in flux.  It needs to be changed to something like &quot;Dripped/Running/Streaked/Flowing/Spilled down the graying wood are dried streams of blood, an ornament of a past victim.&quot;
 
Covered with grime, the grey-brown mop is stiff from old vomit.  The pungent stench is almost strong enough to emit fine vapours of wretchedness.  Green bacterial mold grows at the base of the handle where it meets its cloth counterpart.  At the top of the worn handle sits a squished eyeball.  Dried crooked lines of cracked blood drip down the greying wood, it is an ornament of a past victim.

COMMENTS:
 
Your imagery is astounding, Allison! However, please try not to fall into the trap of thinking for the players and explaining mechanisms to them directly. I know it's hard, because I do it sometimes as well, but try to hint to how these things work rather than tell them. For instance, look at the last sentence of your 'pole' ed and how I have rephrased it. You tell the reader directly that the hook magically rises once the shoulders are dislocated. However, when the reader comes in, they will not see torture all the time. So try show them what they CAN see: traces, marks, scars, etc.
 
Otherwise, your work is great and you are doing a great job of scarrying the pants off me. `-Cristina

    <editsecondcomments>Lovely Allison, the room is nearly golden. The most important point I would make is about your sentence six. I changed the sentence to suggest exactly why it is visible that the screws have released the debris and why how that is related to the shaking of the pole. I hope you agree with the reformulation, but if you don't, please feel free to change it and send another 2nd Draft note when you are finished. Well done on this one! `-Cristina

      <desc>The hook placed at the curvature of the pole serves as a torture tool; its 
simplicity is somewhat deceiving.  When chained to it, its victims are 
certain to die a tortured and painful death.  In a traditional, 
behind-the-back, handcuff pose, the interrogated is hung by the wrists.  
Hours in this position will eventually dislocate the shoulders from the 
sockets.  Only inches above the floor, the victims are helpless and cannot 
support their weight.  Traces in the barren wood of the pole show that the 
hook can be raised even higher, so as to prevent any prisoners from touching 
the ground, even after their shoulders are dislocated.

A double-handled saw hangs on two hooks implanted into the stone wall.  The 
inch-long teeth of the saw are designed to easily cut through human flesh.  
Hung head-down and with their legs spread, the prisoners are helplessly 
vulnerable to an interrogator interested in flesh-carving.  One might 
imagine that the technique is highly effective, given that the contraption 
offers a victim's genitals at perfect height for a first cut.  Any 
unfortunate prisoner's screams would freely echo down the exits that stand 
north, south, west, north, and southeast.  
</editsecond>
    <editsecondcomments>Ouch, sinister suggestions about those genitals, Allison! Yuck, this is definitely one place I'd most definitely hate to be! I tweaked things here and there, but nothing major. In sentence six, however, you have a slightly-confusing turn of phrase, since it seems that the interrogator is hung head-down. I've also rephrased sentence seven since, again, here you tell us what happens rather than show us.
 
Otherwise, you are doing a cracking job of these cells! `-Cristina

      <desc>The tall metal frame is screwed into the stone floor to prevent the narrow 
structure from crashing to the ground.  Two chains adorned with cuffs are 
affixed to each corner of the rectangle.  When interrogated, the victim is 
hung face down in a forced, spread-eagle position.  Suspended two inches in 
the air, the prisoner is unable to move.  The easy access to the victim's 
privates and the multitude of bloodstains on the floor leave little to be 
imagined as to the proceedings of such torture.

      <desc>This tool resembles the typical, two-man saw often used by lumberjacks to 
cut trees.  About three feet long, the chisel-edged blades are designed to 
rip wood cells from one another.  With wooden handles on each end, two 
people are needed to operate the tool.  Sharp enough to cut down a tree, 
this instrument can easily slice through human flesh and bone.  The teeth 
are sticky with old blood and are beginning to rust, due to the lack of 
proper cleaning.  If a victim is lucky enough to live through the 
interrogation, tetanus will ensure a painful death.

human-high, cylindrical pit in its centre.  In the hole itself, cuffs are 
attached to the stone, probably to hold some one there.  However, against

      <desc>A slightly-whitish trail goes from the pit to the western wall and to the 
vivarium.  The latter is the dry kind meant for insects rather than for 
underwater species.  In it sit a handful of large, curly leaves; there are 
also a lot of small-sized, slime-covered bones.  From the sparse skulls, 
these once belonged to rats, rabbits and cats.  The muck comes probably from 
the slugs sliding lazily around the vivarium.  On the wooden frame is fixed 
a tiny, weenie plaque, which reads &quot;Flesh-Eating Slugs&quot;.

    <desc>Evidently below sea level, this cell's ceiling is a transparent magical 
barrier surmounting a barred grate.  The murky light filtering down through 
several hundred feet of ocean bathes the chamber a gloomy, shimmering glow.  
Ripples in the water and shadows of sea creatures passing overhead create an 
unceasing sense of movement in the isolated stone chamber.  Marking the 
ubiquitous grey walls, just below the ceiling, is a greenish smear of a 
water mark.  No doubt the effect is intended to remind the cell's inhabitant 
just what would happen if the magical ceiling were to fail.  The single 
exit, a stone slab to the east, is completely featureless.  The door fits 
so snugly into the frame that it is probably water-tight.  It is not a 
detail intended to inspire confidence.

    <desc>This room is far longer than it is wide, and stretches until the far wall is 
no bigger than a thumbnail.  The cell is obviously submerged in water, as 
the southern wall is glass and one can see into a murky ocean through the 
dusty glass.  The floor is made out of thin, iron grating; and one can see 
through the gaps.  A generous coating of flaming coals spreads across the 
length of the room beneath the grating, ready to surge up and burn whomever 
it pleases.  Black burn marks dot the walls.  The only lights that shine 
into the room are the eerie, green glow from the ocean beyond and the 
spitting, crimson fire from the coals below.  The stench of burned meat 
lingers in the smoky air.  The only way out is a bolted, metal door to the 
north.

    <desc>The ceiling, walls, and floor of this oval tunnel connect to each other as 
if the chamber were simply a hollowed rock. The jagged and rough stone 
threatens injury to any bare skin that it may come into contact with. A 
crimson liquid shines spectacularly from a gap on the ground. Limply hanging 
from some particularly jagged rock is a piece of torn cloth. The thin air 
curses all that breathe it, threatening suffocation. The tunnel extends 
northeast while the southwestern end changes into Interrogatio Tabulatus.

no attempt at levelling it. The miserable corridor continues northeast and

of the passageway because a thick fog shields the rest from view. Small

White frost lines the smooth, grey walls so that they are barely visible. 
Sharp pieces of jagged stone stick out of the nearly-freezing liquid,

smooth ceiling, like miniature, frozen daggers. Thick, white frost covers 
the walls, except for a few, random lines, where water ran from the ceiling 
and froze to the unearthly medium. The windy passage leads south toward 
Interrogatio Tabulatus while also continuing north.

    <desc>. An inch of water rests under a layer of thick ice on the ground of this 
passage.  Claw marks, etched into the sheet of ice on the walls, lead north 
as though someone were dragged in that direction whilst fighting against 
their horrific fate.  Two-inch long icicles dangle from the seven-foot 
ceiling, offering wounds to any thing that disturbs their peace.  A frozen 
bar of chocolate lies, thrown aside, against the western wall.  The tunnel 
stretches south to Interrogatio Tabulatus and leads north.

    <desc>. The jagged bits of rock are hardly visible under the frost-covered layer of 
solid ice that stretches on the floor of this pathway.  Huge icicles drip 
from the ceiling like the deadly fangs of some giant serpent.  The smell of 
rotting flesh sifts through the freezing air, working its way into every 
crevice of the room.  Several holes in the ice make it clear something was 
forced through here.  The room is filled with a fierce, indescribable cold.  
This secret tunnel extends south to Interrogatio Tabulatus and north.

    <desc>. Small banks of snow rest in the corners of this rough, stone passage.  The 
floor, ceiling, and walls are coated in layers of ice.  Huge icicles 
decorate the ceiling.  An oak wand is sticking out of a pile of snow, barely 
visible.  The air is a blistering negative eight degrees and laced with the 
sickening smell of rotted, human flesh.  Blood, frozen to a sharp piece of 
ice on the ground, sadistically stresses the pure whiteness of the 
surrounding area.  The passage leads south to Interrogatio Tabulatus and 
continues north.

    <desc>Ice coats everything in this below-freezing chamber.  Frozen pieces of 
frost-covered ice stick out of the walls and floor, offering harm to 
anything careless enough to fall on them.  Giant icicles reach for the 
ground, dangling like enormous spikes on a whip.  Small piles of snow rest 
along the edges of the passage.  A thick, white frost coats the surface of 
everything.  The unbearable, never-ceasing cold lingers in the air, biting 
at everything.  The miserable tunnel leads south to Interrogatio Tabulatus 
and continues north.

    <desc>. A foot of ice reaches off the walls, floor, and ceiling of this passage.  A 
smooth layer of frost coats the ice-covered walls.  Snow blankets the 
ground, stretching southward across the floor, as though escaping some 
horrible pain.  This tunnel is void of footsteps, handprints, claw marks, 
and any other sign of human life.  The smell of rotting bodies floats 
through the blistering air like a poisonous gas.  The hallway extends south 
toward Interrogatio Tabulatus and leads north.

    <editdraft>The layer of ice on this iceberg reaches higher than ever before.  Even as 
the temperature drops noticeably.  It moans, anguished, under two feet of 
snow, which has a thick crust on top.  A foot-long icicle reaches down the 
east wall.  A tunnel leads south to the Interrogatio Tabulatus, and to the 
north, northeast, and northwest.  The layer of ice on this iceberg reaches 
even higher up the walls, even as the temperature drops noticeably.  It 
moans, anguished, under two feet of snow, which has a thick crust on top.  A 
foot-long icicle reaches down the east wall, it's crystalline form twisting 
eerily.  A tunnel leads south to the Interrogatio Tabulatus, and disappears 
into darkness to the north.  The chamber widens to the northeast and 
northwest, shrouded in heavy, low mist.

    <editsecond>(Snow coats the walls and the low, level floor of this cramped chamber; the 
temperatures here are perpetually below the freezing point of water.  A 
thick layer of ice moans under the white, thickly crusted coat of tainted 
white.  Trickling down the east wall is a foot-long icicle.  A tunnel too 
long to see the end of spreads, buried in the deep cold, northwards.  To the 
north, northeast, and northwest opens a wide chamber of dread, swimming in 
the heavy, low mist that clings to every cubic inch of the area.)

    <editsecondcomments>This room has some good ideas.
 
However, you are not giving us all the exits.
 
Also, your sentences are a bit repetitive and muddled. I am not sure, reading your draft, if the ice is on top, or underneath. I am also not sure what the layer of ice rises higher than. I have added a desc that goes along your lines in the Second draft. Feel free to rewrite the room along those lines as well; this was just a suggestion. However, if you do change it, please get it through second edit again.

    <desc>Petra would like some snow...
</desc>
    <editdraft>Like the rest of the iceberg, this lonely corner is cold and dark.  A 
constant, biting wind from the exposed north blows the icy tendrils of a 
gloomy mist.  These wisps reach out hauntingly and diffuse into the 
atmosphere in eerie twisting fingers.  Like a low-hanging cloud, the mist 
clings to whatever it touches, obscuring any nearby surroundings; droplets 
of moisture are frozen against the exit of the cave.  The snow is dry and 
very deep, covering several large rocks in a wavy, telltale line.  A tunnel 
to the Interrogatio Tabulatus extends to the southeast, while to the north, 
east, and northeast, the iceberg extends starkly, drowning in everlasting 
fog.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Petra, I really like this room a lot!  Lets start with some edits though.  
Your second sentence needs to be a permanent wind, or otherwise it belongs 
as an echo, and you also might want to consider changing blows to something 
less harsh, as it doesnt fit well with the finesse of a tendril (I.  E.  
Swirls, touches, stirs).  I changed your 3rd sentence just to make your 
subject more clear to the reader, and the ending seemed a bit stretched :).  
(just so you know, Im doing this edit with cristina so I can be a better 
editor).  She suggested you change the 4th sentence so that it separates for 
2 reasons.  1) we were confused with the cloud, was it the mist cloud or 
another one?  And also, 2) when youre talking about obscuring, thats the 
mist in its cloud-form, and when its frozen, the cloud is in a condensed 
form.  :) (shes so smart!  I never would have caught that, hehe).  In your 
next sentence, powdery snow is usually for low temperatures so you may want 
to take that out.  And also, as only as a mere suggestion and point of 
style, I would like to have clarified if this snow is falling, or already on 
the ground.  :) last, your last sentence had a horizon.  As this is the 
dementor iceberg, (like a cave), there cant be a horizon.  You can fiddle 
with our suggestion if you want as well.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>For your echo, (though written beautifully), needs to be altered.  If you 
want it to be snowing here, then its really not that cold.  You may need to 
have the snow falling magically from the ceiling or something, since the 
place is covered (like a cave as before mentioned).  :) great work!  `-mira 
</editeds>
    <editfirst>Like the rest of the iceberg, this lonely corner is cold and dark.  A biting 
wind from the exposed north blows the icy tendrils of a gloomy mist.  (These 
wisps/The tendrils) reach out hauntingly and diffuse into the atmosphere 
(with eerie twists).  (Like a low-hanging cloud, the mist clings to whatever 
it touches, obscuring any nearby surroundings; droplets of moisture are 
frozen against the exit of the cave). The snow is dry and very
deep, covering small rocks in a wavy, telltale line.  A tunnel to the 
Interrogatio Tabulatus extends to the southeast, (while) to the north, east, 
and northeast, the iceberg (extends starkly, drowning in everlasting fog).  
</editfirst>
    <editfirstcomments>I only have 2 comments.  (I know, my blowhard tendencies are at a surprising whisper today.  =D  1, in the penultimate sentence there's &quot;The snow is dry and very deep, covering small rocks in a wavy, telltale line.&quot;  My issue?  That if they are small rocks and the snow is VERY deep, wouldn't it just look uniform?  Either the rocks need to be larger or the snow less dense.  2, you don't need a comma after 'northeast' in the last sentence.  Great job Pet and Mira!!

    <desc>Gusts of strong wind have smoothed the walls, ceiling, and floor into 
smooth, absolutely-flat surfaces.  Likewise, the exits, to the north, 
northeast, east, southeast, and south, are neat rectangles.  But the wind is 
certainly not accountable for the perfectly-right corners of this cube of 
ice...  If not for the mist invading every inch of this room, the latter 
would be pretty barren, and even boring.  However, the mist is more than 
enough to occupy the mind: composed of billions of sharp ice crystals, it is 
very abrasive and intrusive.  It scratches cheeks raw, blurs the vision, and 
cracks lips; it also worms its way into any natural orifice and uses any 
opening to sneak into one's clothes.  Moreover, it transforms the simple, 
vital act of breathing into a slow torture, as the ice crystals stabs the 
fragile tissues of your mouth, trachea, and lungs.

    <editdraft>A slightly luminous, grey mist crawls heavily against the walls that crouch 
against this thick, tainted chamber; underneath the smoke-like surface, a 
floor is barely visible.  Ice clings to the low ceiling like a frozen 
tumour, multilayered and barely translucent from probably years of existence 
in this dank cold.  The air is suffocating and warmth-draining; chilling, 
depressing fingers of shrouding fog tickle whatever remainders of air this 
sickly room still contains.  To the northeast stands what looks to be a 
narrow gap in a stone block, wide enough for a person to snuggle into.  To 
the east, south, and southeast, the chamber continues, drowned in the 
tainted white of the smoke.

    <editdraft>This crammed, uncomfortable space is tiny, a mere hole in an otherwise 
dense, solid wall.  Any indication as to the age of the construction is 
hidden beneath a deep, dense, thick sheen of ice.  The freezing air is 
crawling with a fierce sense of foreboding only worsened by the flickering, 
dying quality of the grey light given off by the mist that drowns the entire 
floor.  The closeness of the walls would be reassuring if not for the jagged 
icicles hanging from them like daggers, ready to be plunged into their 
nearest target; their edges are sharp and delicate, like a scalpel's blade.  
To the south, southeast, and southwest stretches a more open area, though it 
is impossible to see how long it goes on through the mist.

    <editdraft>Like the breath of some unseen, malevolent creature, a mist swirls and 
spreads everywhere in this dank, closed space.  The freezing air feels like 
the blade of a sharp, subtle knife seeking the delicate tissue of the lungs 
with the intension to brutally cease the inflow of life.  Hanging low, as a 
permanent curse, stands an intricate, inverted pyramid of tendrils and spiky 
icicles: a hidden assassin ready to take the life of any unsuspecting 
passer-by naive enough to stir the lethal weapons into awakening.  To the 
south, west, southwest, and northwest stretches the fog, too thick to 
discern the surroundings further than fifteen feet away; the smoke sheds a 
dim, dying light in which any shadows become snarling monsters and the ice 
glares menacingly.

 However, whereas all water is frozen in most of the surrounding rooms, this

      <desc>The ceiling and eastern wall seem to be thin layers of ice containing 
amounts of water.  Only a couple of feet of dark-green sea are visible 
before darkness swallows up the dim light.  This reveals that the room is 
very deep underwater; the idea that the ice could give way to tons of water 
triggers shivers that have nothing to do with the cold.  Where small, 
needle-sized holes let the water drip into the room, air bubbles can be seen 
going up, until the black waters close in on them.  Because of the 
provenance of the water, the columns, stalactites, and stalagmites show 
hints of green.  While most of their mass is white from being frozen, the 
transparent edges are grass-tinged.  Moreover, the shadows they project are 
of a dark, greyish green.

    <desc>Thin, lethal fingers of ice reach out from the ice-covered ceiling and the 
floor, where some were apparently smashed down.  More surprisingly, 
identical, sharp needles protrude horizontally from the icy walls, defying 
every law of physics.  Frosted blades even extend into the arched exits, to 
the north, northwest, west, and southwest; this makes going through the 
openings without scratching any body part quite a feat.  Moreover, a thick, 
cold mist hovers constantly in the room and blurs out the distance: the ice 
stylets look very close, almost as if they were closing in in a 
blood-curdling, freezing rendition of an iron maiden.

freeze; it hangs low in the air above the icy ground.  There are no tracks

to the north, and a long, dark tunnel leads south to the Interrogatio

    <editdraft>Beneath a writhing cover of rancid, suffocating mist, a jagged, sharp floor 
swims in and out of sight.  The pressure in the atmosphere is incredibly 
high, as though this tainted, smoke-infested hole stood miles beneath the 
surface and ready to collapse.  Frozen tendrils dangling from the low 
ceiling appearing deadly fragile are intent on stabbing any passer-by with 
their sickly-delicate fingers.  In all direction but northeast and 
northwest, the shroud of fog crawls like a lazy, dense octopus.  The little 
light that the smoke itself spreads has the sharp, tainted quality of a 
faulty, grey lantern ready to give way and plunge the entire area into 
complete darkness.

sickly-delicate fingers.  In all directions but northeast and northwest, the 
shroud of fog crawls like a lazy, dense octopus.  The little light that the 
smoke itself spreads has the sharp, tainted quality of a faulty, grey 
lantern, ready to give way and plunge the entire area into complete 
darkness.

    <desc>The cell has no concrete floor being on the bottom level of the prison.  
Instead of concrete, there is merely dirt covering the ground.  A previous 
occupant tried to dig himself out.  However, a magical wall extends downward 
indefinitely, along all the walls of the cell, making it impossible to 
tunnel under the wall.  As a result of this, there is a deep pit at the far 
end of the cell.  No windows exist since the cell is underground.  From the 
torch mounted in the corridor, a flicker of light creeps into the cell 
through a tiny crack under the heavy wooden door to the south.

Sentence three doesn't make sense - what has age and torment ( torment of what  ) have to do with windows? 
 
Second to last sentence: we try to encourage our builders to give more concrete info to the readers rather than use 'generalisms' like this. For instance, you could rephrase as I have below, when the 'generalism' in fact becomes a characterization of the previous sentence. 
 
I do, however, like your imagery and the darkness that you have put in this cell.

    <editsecondcomments>Ah, the morbid feel of Azkaban - well done on capturing it! Some notes, though:
 
Try not to repeat things that have the same sound or are simple repetitions of the same word. (like in sentence three: drops  and drip). I have rephrased sentence four to avoid some of the repetition; this is just a suggestion, so it's between brackets. If you choose not to rephrase it like this, please send me a note and I'll come see what you have rephrased it to.
 
Second to last sentence: please try not to make judgements for the players - your information has to have a good, solid content. This is a great phrase in a book, but it's a generalization and a sort of mental assessment of what the people see here. Maybe a Death Eater would think this is lovely. (This refers to the second to last sentence, which I have removed; the contents of it are included in sentence six)

    <desc>A rank, overpowering scent fills this fifteen-foot triangular cell, 
obviously originating from the two dead bodies in the corners.  
Half-decayed, one lies sprawled on his stomach in the south corner with one 
hand reaching towards the door.  The rotting remains of the other body are 
huddled against the walls of the east corner, the skull split open.  Unlike 
the floors, these walls are not dirt.  They are made of muddy brown stones 
that crumble and flake to the touch, and the low ceiling is made of the 
same.  Strange, green flames burn in the torches mounted in each corner of 
the room, casting a sickly hue through the room and leaving piles of green 
ash on the floor beneath them.

    <desc>A single, dangling lightbulb from the ceiling illuminates the cell, which 
has a decidedly-sickening smell of raw meat, mixed with an odd, perfumed, 
vanilla scent.  A crushed, metal bedframe is crammed into a corner, directly 
below an array of engravings on the wall.  Disturbed markings are spread 
across every wall of the room, some in an indecipherable language, while the 
rest are etched plainly into the stone.  The ceiling seems to have been 
painted white a long time ago, but large, grey spots are starting to appear 
in the wake of falling chips of pale paint.  A large spot of blood rests in 
the very centre of the room, still looking fresh.  The only way out is 
through a heavy-looking wooden door to the east.

    <desc>This particular cell in the Vespertilio Turris branch of Azkaban looks like 
no other cell in the entire tower.  It's a cramped, claustrophobic, 
low-ceilinged box with very little room to move, let alone walk about.  The 
air is still and noiseless, and a musty smell hangs around the place.  
Broken glass is wedged in between dark bricks on all four walls, which are 
painted a scuffed shade of black.  The ceiling is covered completely with 
dank, green moss which drips perpetually onto the floor.  The ground itself 
is a skidmarked, wooden affair, with cheap, pale planks set out in a plain 
pattern.  A thin, curved knife is stabbed into one of the planks.  There is 
only one, thin, iron door to the south through which one may exit.  No 
illumination adorns the ceiling or walls, save for a small sliver of light 
from a hole carved into the door.

    <desc>Six feet by six feet, this cell is host to a number of extraordinary 
devices. Against the far wall are four cufflinks that are attached directly 
to the wall. Charmed to stay in place, they are clearly for restraint 
purposes. Three feet off the wall, in the centre of the room, is a small 
basin filled with some sort of blood. Refilled daily, it is all the captive 
of the room is allowed: the bare minimum to survive. No windows are present 
in this cell, and the walls are perfectly even with not even the smallest of 
holes. A small, wooden door leads west to a corridor.

    <desc>The darkness of this eight by four foot cell makes it difficult to see its 
shabby condition.  The stone walls and floor are severely chipped and small 
pebbles and rocks litter every surface.  The small, unmade cot occupies 
almost the entire room.  A pile of threadbare sheets sit next to the pillow 
at one end, both dusted with rubble from the walls.  The torch next to the 
door is unlit, creating no light for the room, but also adding no heat to 
the already uncomfortably warm cell.  There is no window in this cell to 
allow a breeze and the taste of stone dust fills the stale air.  The door, 
which has no handle, leads to the west.  It is made of a darker stone and 
is sealed tightly to its frame, not permitting even the smallest ray of 
light to pass into the room from the corridor beyond.

      <desc>The dark stone of the door is battered, just like the rest of the room.  The 
gouges and dents are the marks of some former prisoners' frustrations and 
feeble escape attempts.  The very edges of the door, however, are very well 
maintained and smooth, as is the section of the wall immediately surrounding 
the door.  Great efforts have been made to ensure complete and total 
darkness.

      <desc>The narrow cot is stained and worn.  Except for the rubble from the walls, 
the folded sheets sitting atop it look clean enough.  The grey sheets are 
thin and threadbare, but the heat of the room makes warmer bedding 
unnecessary.
