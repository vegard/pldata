    <desc>A small green caterpillar lays here, crawling on legs that are barely visable, only a bit faster then a turtle. It stops every once in awhile to eat some of the passing vegetation for his metamorphosis that will transfrom this dull creature into a beautiful butterfly, where he will be able to finally fly off and be with the others of his kind.

    <desc>A smooth, paved path tiredly stretches from the west, breaking at the feet 
of these high, regular steps, that lead eastward into Hogwarts Castle.  The 
sombre, grey stone of the stairs is cracked into patternless, sharp cuts, 
which crease the otherwise-level surface like they would a wrinkled, old 
face.  The fresh aroma of the immense grounds around the wizarding school 
mixes with the dusty, pungent scent of occasionally-damp granite.  Rounded 
around the edges and worn by time, the steps show slight indentations where 
feet have fallen particularly frequently.  The castle towers above the 
semicircular platform that lies at the foot of the large, front doors, 
providing some measure of shelter during windy times.  The sheer, vertical 
walls to the east have small trenches in them, dug by hundreds of years of 
rain trickling down in an inevitable fall towards the ground.  To the north 
and northwest stretch patches of clear, green grass.

      <desc>Two, large, oak doors rise tall above the top of the stone steps, their 
surface cracked and swollen where rain has scarred it.  The wood is clean 
and well-tended, smooth for the most part, exuding a peaceful, strong scent 
of sturdy freshness.  The emblem of Hogwarts, with the griffin, the badger, 
the raven, and the serpent gathered around the letter H, stands about three 
quarters up each of the two gates, patient and everlasting.

    <desc>A twenty-foot wide path sternly stretches through, connecting a pair of 
barely-visible, western gates and the double doors of Hogwarts Castle, to 
the east.  Dancing between the ornamental, white pebbles adorning the road 
are specks of dust that beat a wild, fantastic rhythm against the ground, 
irrespective of any wind.  Sweet, soft aromas of vanilla and roses fill the 
air at all times, flooding the pathway in a temperate, tender explosion of 
scent.  To the south and southwest, sheltered from any storms by the form of 
the castle, are flowerbeds.  The walkway is well-tended, although showing 
signs of wear from the centuries of feet and carriages crossing it, its 
smoothness marred into a sea of tiny hillocks and vales.  On either side of 
the road stand tall, copper poles, at the end of which are glass boxes, 
exuding a welcoming, white glow.  Parallel to the path on the north side are 
clear patches of grass.

      <desc>Six foot high poles stand at either side of the path, their surfaces clean 
and smooth.  At the top of each lamp a ring holds a glass box, inside which 
a glowing haze writhes like a candle, giving off a light that appears soft 
and gentle during daytime and powerful and reassuring during the night.  The 
edges of the flame change from calming blue to innocent pink, passing 
smoothly through all the intermediate shades.

    <desc>Tall, black lampposts rise every few feet along this carefully-tended, wide 
path.  Some pebbles, set as ornamentation along the road, catch the light in 
a matted, rich pattern of white and shades of grey.  Dust rises in 
tumultuous mini-cyclones, beating and breaking against the dented, wrinkled 
pavement, that still appears almost intact after what could easily be 
centuries of wear.  Scents of vanilla and rose spread through the air in 
spirals of tenderness and gentle passion.  Cradled beneath the shadows of 
the magnificent Hogwarts Castle, the drive appears protected and peaceful.  
To the northeast, and parallel to the road to the south, stretch flower 
beds, bathed in a whirlpool of colours and aromas, from the most tender of 
pinks to the fiercest, darkest shades of blue.  The path gently rolls along 
to the east, stumbling at the feet the large stairs leading into the castle, 
while far into the western distance are the outlines of a pair of black 
gates.  To the north lies a patch of clear grass, its green tinge bright and 
overwhelmingly-cheerful.

      <desc>No intricate models mar the smooth surfaces of these black poles, yet every 
inch of them exudes an area of ancient beauty.  At the end of each lamp 
post, a ring holds a glass box, which gives off a white gleam that spreads 
like a comforting, surreal blanket over the entire surroundings.  Inside the 
heavy lamps, the flame changes colour around the edges, from pink to blue, 
its everlasting dance captivating, slow, and passionate.

    <desc>The tall lampposts, set every few feet along the sweeping drive, are a 
copper tinge that throws reddish glows against the surrounding green and 
white.  The pathway is neat and well-tended, stretching between two, black, 
iron gates to the west and the wooden doors of Hogwarts Castle to the east.  
Its worn and frequently-treaded surface is somewhat wrinkled, in a mask of 
old age and dignity.  Ornaments of pebbles, the colour of the clearest 
cloud, catch any light and reflect it in golden nimbuses, like halos of 
saints.  Flanked by the last shadows of the peaceful Hogwarts, the paved 
road allows a view of the richness of the Grounds to the west.  Alongside 
the stone way, a rolling mass of green stirs and struggles, in an explosion 
of colour that contrasts with the grey granite.  Waves of aromas, ranging 
from soft vanilla to the deep sweetness of roses, linger in the air, 
sometimes strong, sometimes faded, like mere echoes of scent.  To the north 
and decorating the south of the path stretch flower beds, like mosaics of 
rich colours and smells.

      <desc>The old castle of Hogwarts is made of grey rock, its walls level and mostly 
smooth, except for the traces which hundreds of years of rain have etched 
into them.  The upper levels are covered in gentle arms and fingers of ivy, 
some erupting from edges of the many windows that brighten its stern and 
noble face.  At the feet of the wizarding school stretch carpets upon 
carpets of unchanged flowers, in all the colours of the rainbow.

    <desc>A twenty-foot wide path stretches between the far, large, black gates, 
crayoned against the westward horizon, and the tall, brown, wooden doors of 
Hogwarts Castle that stand a distance to the east.  Dazzlingly-white pebbles 
decorate the road, their polished surfaces reflecting any light in sharp 
outbursts of brightness.  The soft scent of vanilla clashes with the 
overwhelming freshness of the Hogwarts Grounds.  During most seasons, green 
grass spreads all around, except to the south, to the northeast, and to the 
southeast, where flower beds lavishly grow in striking mosaics of colour and 
aroma.  Beyond a small patch of trees, the faintest shape of a glass-covered 
building can be seen, far to the northwest.  The contour of the large 
Quidditch Pitch is outlined against the sky to the southwest.  The shadows 
of the Hogwarts Castle cradle the path at its eastern birth, reaching this 
distant section of the drive only with their longest spears.  At either side 
of the path stand tall, black lampposts.

      <desc>Simple, linear designs trace the lower section of these tall, black posts.  
Although they must have guarded the path for many centuries, the poles are 
as unmarred and the lamps as bright as ever, encased in glass boxes hanging 
motionlessly some six feet above the ground.  The vague outline of the flame 
varies in colour from pink to blue, flickering and writhing passionately 
sometimes, only to die down demurely seconds afterwards.

    <desc>The tall lampposts that stand at every few feet along this wide, stone 
pathway are coppery-tinged, their colour so rich that it almost exudes the 
sharp, tongue-biting taste of the metal.  The air is savoury and 
overwhelmingly-fresh, filled with the sweet essence of vanilla and glazed 
with the thick scent of roses.  To the north and south stretch the wide 
Hogwarts Grounds, coloured, during most of the year, in hundreds of shades 
of green.  By contrast, the drive that passes through to the east and west 
is decorated with white pebbles, that take in and reflect any light in 
glorious nimbuses, like golden halos.  To the northwest emerges a vegetable 
patch, shaded and guarded by the large, knobbly frames of a few cherry 
trees.  Rising out of the clear grass to the south is the great, beige 
contour of the Quidditch Pitch, crayoned against the open horizon above.  
Twirling leaves embrace the stems of a few, colourful balls of ever-blooming 
blossoms that have exploded from the confines of a southeastern flowerbed.

    <editdraft>.  A large raven, carved out of a bush stands here at twenty feet tall, and 
ten feet wide.  The raven suddenly jumps up, sending many leaves to the 
ground.  It rises about fifty feet in the air and begins soaring around the 
Grounds.  As it flies, it releases leaves of many different colours.  Red, 
gold, yellow, brown, and purple leaves begin floating through the air and 
down to the ground.  As the raven lands, it shows its blue and bronze 
coloured leaves that don't quiver, and fall off like the others do; these 
shades seem oddly familiar.  Also, to the north you will find yourself at a 
Smooth Lawn, to the east you will see a Gnome-Infested Flowerbed, towards 
the south is a Sweeping Drive, onto the west is a Low Hedge, towards the 
northeast is yet another Smooth Lawn, whereas northwest leads to a Hidden 
Trail, southeast will lead to a great, Sweeping Path, and lastly southwest 
leads to another Sweeping Drive.

    <editdraftcomments>Michael, just a heads up, we use british spelling here on the MUD.  So color 
should be colour :) and you use that word a lot, so I changed the last one 
to 'shades'.  I also didn't see any need to capitalize Raven, so I 
lowercased those all.  If I'm wrong, cris will fix it :)

    <desc>There is a petite, winding path of gravel and inlaid stones here.  The 
stones are diverse in shape and are shades of sandstone, limestone, and a 
bravura copper that seems to reflect its own aura of tranquility.  
Blossoming orchid and apple trees with low hanging branches and large, 
draped strands of twisted ivy cloak the path.  Icelandic poppies, zinnias, 
small bushes of pastel-coloured roses, and hundreds of other types of flower 
line the walkway.  Occasionally, a few blades of grass or flowers appear 
through the cracks between the stones themselves.  An exit to the northwest 
leads to a vegetable garden; other exits to the Hogwarts Grounds are present 
to the north, east, south, west, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

    <desc>A distinguished range of vegetables are found on this piece of earth.  
Fertile, black soil, suitable for plants, is found here.  The resulting 
vegetables are large and healthy.  Big, oval, purple-coloured, shiny 
aubergines grow here.  Cauliflower, with nature's delicate covering of 
leaves, are to the east.  Saplings of green peas emerge to the north; 
snow-white, tiny flowers accompany them.  Slimy creepers twine around the 
saplings.  Ferns surround the edges of the garden.  Brown, mud-coloured 
potatoes mushroom out of the land, which are the size of pebbles.  The 
veggie garden extends towards the north, west and the northeast, whilst 
dusty grounds roll open to the east, south, southeast, and the southwest.

    <desc>. Lustrous, green, bell peppers grow on this patch of land.  They are firm, 
plump, and smooth with glossy skins.  Some are shorter than others.  In 
bunches, they grow on the thin branches.  The plants are about three feet 
high.  On ripening, their colour changes slowly to ruby-red.  The leaves are 
broadly rounded, with a tapering tip, while the seeds are circular and flat. 
 In season, single, white flowers occur at the end of the branches.  These 
shrubs yield fleshy fruits.  Some of the withered flowers lie on the dusty 
grounds.  This garden continues east, south, west, southeast, and southwest, 
while open grounds stretch north, northeast, and northwest.

    <desc>A circular area of blue grass covers the ground in this area of the gardens. 
 There are flowers all around varying in colour and size.  Some sing while 
others dance merrily to the tunes.  In the centre of the circle is a nice 
little white table with four chairs and a game of Wizard's Chess laying upon 
it; it seems as though black has been check mated.  There are six trellises 
next to paths leading from the small courtyard going north, east, south, 
west, southeast, and southwest.  Dangling from the southern trellis are an 
array of purple vines, following the path leads to the Vegetable Garden.  
The southwestern and southeastern trellises have sunflowers weaving their 
way through the wood trying to reach the sunlight; the paths near these 
trellises lead to different parts of the Vegetable Garden.  The trellises 
near the paths going north, east, and west contain nothing but a few bee 
nests.  Looking far in each direction is visible a vast stretch of green 
land, Hogwarts Grounds.

    <desc>The tunnel here is made from mahogany wood and is just big enough for two 
lanes of foot traffic.  The roots of ancient trees growing above the tunnel 
can be seen dangling from the ceiling.  The wood has started to rot because 
of the constant berating it takes from the plant life surrounding it.  
Faeries make their homes in the walls of the tunnel; light can be seen 
through the cracks in the wood where they stay.  The path that goes through 
the tunnel is nothing but dirt, those who walk north on it end up in 
Hogwarts Grounds.  Walking south, southeast, and southwest down the path 
leads to the Peaceful Courtyard and the many Vegetable Gardens.  The very 
middle section of the path that isn't walked on as frequently as the west 
and east sides shows a little grass, otherwise the path is bare.  There is a 
torch in a bracket along the tunnel every five feet, they give an eerie glow 
to the long tunnel.

    <desc>The path here is nothing but a dirt trail under a tunnel, little grass grows 
because of the constant traffic north and south.  The tunnel is made of a 
nice mahogany wood that has begun decaying, as plant matter invades upon it. 
 Hanging limply from the ceiling are the roots and bulbs of plants growing 
freely on top of the tunnel.  There are a number of cracks and crevices that 
glow occasionally because of the faeries that make their homes there.  To 
the north, northeast, and northwest is the great expanse of Hogwarts 
Grounds.  To the south is the Peaceful Courtyard and the many Vegetable 
Gardens.  This very long tunnel is lit eerily by nicely placed torches that 
hang in cast iron brackets every few feet along each side of the wall.

    <copyright>Copyright © 2004-2010  Project Legilimensia</copyright>
    <desc>Being worked on by rulgard 
</desc>
    <editdraft>A brilliant patch of yellow and blue plants dominate this area. The plants, 
Mallowsweet, famous for helping centaurs with star gazing, is also used in 
many potions. They are sorted into about one hundred rows, with about fifty 
plants per row. The rows are lathered in 'Jayce's Magical Grow', along with 
natural mineral-rich soil. A scarecrow is in the middle of the patch, 
scaring away the crows that attempt to eat the Mallowsweet. Like many 
patches around here, this one has enchanted mist that falls to give the 
plants their drinks.

buttons down the front. It is hanging from a stake in the ground, and is 
composed entirely of straw. The straw seems to be jinxed together so it will 
not fall out. It waves its arms at the occasional crow, and sometimes even 
emits an earsplitting roar to crows that won't go away.

    <desc>Emerald-green, tall trees grow to the north.  To compete for sunlight, they 
grow as tall as twenty-feet high, their shadows making the path to the east 
darker.  Their branches hang low like tough ropes.  Stones, pebbles, and 
twigs lie along the pathway.  In season, the scent emitting from the wild 
flowers lining the path is addictive.  Silhouetted to the far west is a 
small hut, while at a short distance to the south are the greenhouses.  
Dusty grounds stretch to the east, west, southeast, and the southwest while 
the forest extends in all other directions.

    <desc>The southwestern corner the Quidditch Pitch looms close to this place.  
Leaning against the crook between the southern and western portions of the 
Hogwarts Outer Wall shivers a group of young, healthy trees.  Their leaves 
are a green so tender and see-through that they look almost yellow.  The 
trees also bear fruits: yellow and pink peaches; amber and translucent 
plums; and golden pears.  In the middle of this little grove stands on a 
socle a statue of a young, shapely woman, wild mane of unruly mane flowing 
down past her hips.  She is lifting the hem of her robes with one hand so as 
to hold the numerous, succulent fruit she has gathered; her legs show up to 
her mid-thighs.  Between a few peaches and two pears sits a white, round 
opal that the woman lightly covers with her other hand.  A haze of heat 
shrouds her like a cloak and blankets the whole patch in summer warmness.

    <desc>White lines of foam advance towards this lakeside.  The ever-blowing winds 
in this way seem like they are panting for breath.  Waves thud against the 
boulders in their path of infinity.  The coast shines as brightly as ivory.  
Criss-crossed tree branches hang low above the way.  This road, covered in 
dusty leaves, continues south.  A lake with crystal clear water lies to the 
east and southeast, while dusty grounds roll open to the west and southwest.

    <desc>The soil in this area is soft and black, two characteristics that it owes 
respectively to the south and southeastern Hogwarts Lake, and to the western 
Forbidden Forest.  This patch constitutes the northeasternmost limit of the 
grounds.  Little exits are offered and lead either to the aforesaid lake, or 
to the above-mentioned forest; only a narrow path staggers southwest, 
between those two obstacles and onto safer ground.  Up on the point, 
slightly overlooking the lake and with its back to the Forest, stands a 
statue of a hunchback.

      <desc>Under a thatch of dirty-blonde hair, the hunchback is broadly grinning, 
showing irregular teeth.  He is holding a wand in his left hand, but the 
point resides in his palm, while the bottom looks out to the lake.  In his 
other hand and over his shoulder, he is lifting a bundle on a long, rough 
stick.  His clothes are a strange collection to behold, as though he'd tried 
to dress like a Muggle without any knowledge of what Muggles actually wear.  
He's wearing a ruff over a tunic with a low neckline, comically showing his 
collarbone.  A belt with a long scabbard circles his waist, but no sword is 
visible.  The tunic reaches down to mid-thigh, and luckily so, since the man 
apparently forgot to put on pants and favoured tights instead.  And yet, 
even the tights are torn off, baring the underside of the right thigh.  This 
is supposedly the work of the sculpted baby dragon currently wrapping up the 
right tibia and biting at his exposed flesh.  This makes the hunchback's 
smile even more puzzling.

      <desc>The scabbard may be empty, but it is nonetheless a beautiful work of art.  
Although mainly made out of reddish-brown leather, thin bands of metal are 
inlaid into intricate knotworks all along the handle.  The knotworks outline 
a plain, very shallow rectangle in the middle of the face closer to the man; 
the angle makes it a little difficult to see the symbol carved in the centre 
of the figure, though it looks like a capital 'O' or maybe a big zero.  In 
any case, the mark is an ellipse of some kind.

    <name>First Draft Patch of Grass</name>
    <copyright>Copyright © 2004-2010  Project Legilimensia</copyright>
    <desc>This is patch of grass is maintained by Kanru's Lawn and Garden Ltd.
 
More echoes will be added as I come up with them.
</desc>
    <editdraft>Grass covers the ground here.  Starting from the edge of the path to the 
south, spreads west.  On the east side, the grass grows right into the edge 
of on of the massive Hogwarts walls.  Plush and thick, like a Pygmy Puffs 
fur, the grass here stays warm in the summer and peaks through even the 
deepest snow in the winter as if wanting to make sure it is always seen.  To 
the west, the entrance to a flowery alcove carries the faintest scent of 
flowers and vanilla whenever the breeze blows.  In the centre of this grass 
is a large oak tree to provide extra shade during the summer.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Sentence 1: This should be more descriptive.  It is the opening line to your 
room!  You want players to read your description, not just pass it by.  If 
it looks like you didn't put effort into writing it, then they won't put 
effort into reading it.  Sentence two: This sentence makes absolutely no 
sense at all.  What is starting from the edge of the path?  In which 
direction is the edge of the path?  What is spreading west?  Nouns are our 
friends, use more of them.  Sentence 3: On the &quot;east side&quot; of what?  Be 
descriptive, tell us what you're talking about.  We need cold, hard nouns 
here.  Also, the second part of this sentence doesn't make any sense; &quot;edge 
of on of the massive Hogwarts walls&quot;?  Is there, perhaps, * still * a 
spelling error in there, even after you were asked to redraft the room, and 
you were specifically asked to re-read and check for spelling errors?  I 
know it can be hard without MS Word, but this is a simple error.  I even 
went so far as to go online and look up this website for you: http://www.  
Spellcheck.  Net/ .  It has a free spell-checker, so no more excuses.  Learn 
it, use it, love it.  Sentence 4: &quot;Pygmy Puffs&quot; should have an apostrophe 
before the &quot;s&quot;, as it is possesive.  Add a comma after &quot;winter&quot;.  Sentence 
5: This is a good, descriptive sentence, however it has to be static.  Take 
out the part about the breeze and you're golden.  Sentence 6: Add a comma 
after &quot;tree&quot;.  And otherwise, there are no more mechanical errors.  However, 
looking at the description of this room, this is what we know: 1) There is 
soft grass that always likes to be seen.  2) There is a tree.  And that's 
it.  Grass and a tree?  This is Harry Potter's -magical- world.  It needs 
some extra descriptive things.  Are there squirming, giant jelly-bean-like 
plants that puff different coloured smoke every few minutes?  Are there 
white flowers that chirp like birds every time someone gets too close to 
them?  How does the tree hold itself?  Are there vines hanging off it that 
pick the fruit from it once it gets ripe?  Are there slug-like creatures 
with legs that leave sparkling trails of glory behind them and live in the 
tree?  The room is good, but definitely missing something.  Try thinking 
about something more for this area and adding it, then sending back another 
note with the edited draft so I can pop back in and take a look for you.  
(And feel free to use any of the examples I left for you!)  Thanks so much 
for all your hard work, and I'm only pushing you like this because I know 
you have the potential to be one of the best, if not the best, writer on 
this MUD.  Keep up the great work, Russell!  Xoxo Jess 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>. You misspelled &quot;dissipating&quot;.  Like I said in the above comments, there is 
something missing.  There are over 1000 students at Hogwarts, doesn't * one 
* of them walk by?  No one is playing with fanged frisbees, running away 
crying, cursing someone, or playing a joke?  You can do better than this, 
Russell.  Also, I don't like any of this &quot;when I think of them&quot; nonsense.  I 
am putting quite a bit of my own, personal time into editing this for you.  
Finish the room before you send it to me.

    <desc>The grass is thicker here than in the surrounding areas.  A bright, white, 
picket fence is here, with a gate sitting in the middle of it.  The smell of 
roses and vanilla permeates the air in a wonderful combination.  The flowery 
alcove to the north is very pleasant, and inviting.  To the east is a field 
of lush, green grass, in the shade of the castles towering walls.  To the 
south, southeast, and southwest is the great, stone, pathway, leading in, 
and out of the Hogwarts Grounds.  To the west, sits a very inviting patch of 
grass, with a single, tall, oak tree.

    <desc>A mass of assorted flowers fill up nearly all the space in this cosy alcove. 
 A wooden garden bench, nestled amongst a generous mound of pristine rose 
bushes, sits at the far end of the niche.  Towering behind the over-spilling 
flowers are three hedges, six-feet-tall walls of verdant shrubbery, 
providing privacy to the nook.  Cobblestone paving covers the bare dirt of 
the ground.  A rich, perfumed scent fills the air, and a quiet rustling 
sound emanates from the surrounding leaves.  A short, white, picket fence 
stretches over the south side of the alcove, and a little gate opens the way 
out.

    <desc>The field is brightly coloured, green with little, vibrant, yellow, 
buttercups, scattered hither and thither.  The grass is blissfully soft.  
The smells of vanilla and rose fill the air, making the air erupt with a 
spirit of tranquility.  To the east sits the entrance to a beautiful, 
flowery alcove, with a white picket fence.  To the south, southeast, and 
southwest is the illustrious, stone walkway to and from the Hogwarts castle. 
 To the west is planted a beautiful flower bed.

    <desc>The flashing colour of the poinsettia plants meets the eye while walking 
through this patch of earth.  Several spells and enchantments keep the 
weather warm for the delicate plants.  The leaves cluster close to each 
other and spread like the hands of a starfish; they flash red as though to 
attract attention.  Veins criss-cross across the surface of the leaves.  The 
flowers are small, either green, or yellow, situated in the midst of the 
bracts.  In winter, when snow accumulates on these plants, they look 
surrounded by four moons.  Nature adds a large amount of beauty to its own 
creations like Santa giving out gifts.  These plants are mainly used for 
delightful decorations during Christmas.  This eye-catching flower bed 
continues north.  A long patch of grass seems to invite people towards the 
east.  A long, sweeping path lies southwest; the sweeping drive lies south 
and southeast, whilst long, open grounds are to the west and northwest.

    <desc>A huge wall rises to the east of this lovely, flower-strewn patch of earth.  
During autumn dry, withered leaves decorate the area to the west.  Small 
pebbles separate the various plants.  The air is full of a 
magically-enchanting scent.  In the middle of the well-kept flower bed, 
lilies are the centre of attraction due to their milky whiteness.  Nearby, a 
wide range of yellowish-white daffodils, in different shades, bloom.  The 
ground is covered in multi-coloured blossoms towards the north and the south 
and to the northwest and southwest stand tall trees.

    <desc>Blackthorn shrubs about six metres high, dominate this part of land.  The 
branches have the colour of burnt umber, to match the ivory white blooms.  
White, stalkless blossoms with numerous petals and long pollen grains grow 
on them in groups, like garlands.  The side-shoots develop into thorns.  
Jade coloured, oval-shaped leaves emerge on the branches, near the flowers.  
The plant's leaves struggle away from the stems, in an attempt to reach 
higher towards the sky; they clearly hope to catch any incoming sunlight.  
This beautiful flowerbed turns lovelier as it moves north, south, and 
northwest, while wide grounds meet the eyes to the west and southwest.

    <desc>Heavily-fragrant jasmine flowers bloom from this fertile, brown soil.  They 
are pure-white, silky, smooth, like flawless pearls with five or six lobes.  
These pale blooms have a sweet smell.  Quite often the plant is used for 
decorations in the school, while sometimes girls braid it in their hair.  
The leaves of the plants are simple and have nine or ten leaflets.  The 
shrub is also known as &quot;Moonlight of the Grove&quot;.  The deep green of the 
leaves and the white of the blooms give it a simple, yet enchanting look.  
The plants seem to love the night, as they spread open more widely after 
sunset.  The path is decorated by delicate petals and dry leaves.  This 
breathtaking flowerbed continues south and west, while wide, open grounds 
stretch infinitely to the southwest.

    <desc>This flowerbed is a dismal mess.  Though a few plants are still upright, 
most lie sideways, their roots sadly dangling in the air.  In season, most 
of the flowers' buds, leaves, stems, and roots, whether pulled down or still 
upright, bear minute marks of gnawing and tearing.  The upturned soil is 
carved into knuckle-deep, hand-wide grooves.  The only places spared by the 
maniacal authors of this disarray are eight stone paths leading in all 
directions, though the stones are disjointed, chipped, and raised in some 
places.  The southern border of this flowerbed, the drive between the castle 
and its gates, alone is left untouched.  To the west, another flowerbed 
separates this area from Hogwarts Castle.

    <editdraft>This flowerbed is a dismal mess.  Though some plants are still upright, most 
lie sideways, roots sadly dangling in the air.  Pulled down or still 
upright, most flowers and buds (in season), leaves, stems, and roots bear 
minute marks of gnawing and claw-tearing and dirty traces.  Some random 
blades of grass poke their tip up, but most are ripped up.  The soil is 
carved in places into knuckle-deep, hand-wide grooves and into shallow, 
muddy puddles.  Where the ground is unscarred, it is ridden with small, 
round holes, that closer inspection reveals as gnomes holes.  The only 
somewhat-spared places are the eight stone paths, though the stones are 
disjointed, chirped, and raised in some places; plus black earth is 
scattered over them.  Likewise, the tiny lime stones dappled here and there 
are untouched, though mucky.  The southern border of this flowerbed being 
the Drive from the Hogwarts Gates, it is left completely unblemished.  To 
the west, another flowerbed separates this area from the Hogwarts Castle.

    <editdraftcomments>This desc is only 4 sentences long too, if you feel up to it and inspired, 
it'd be great to see more!  But awww, the poor flowers!  They're so 
helpless, lol.  Great room though, carole :) 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please change every 'Gnome' to 'gnome' and every 'Gnomes' to 'gnomes'. I've refferenced it to book 2.
 
2) BESIDE those changes, could you also change the following echoes:
 
- echo number 1 to: 'A gnome whistles completely off-key and out of tune; luckily, it is only for a couple of seconds.'
 
- echo number 4: I am confused about the doorstep. Doorstep to what door? Perhaps change to: 'A gnome reclines lazily right at the entrance to its hole.'
 
- echo number 5 to: 'A gnome uses the biggest limestone on the patch as a kind of diving board into a minute pond.'
 
- echo number 13 to: 'Some gnome children are engaged in a mud battle; compacted, black, mud balls are flying this way and that.'
 
- echo number 14 to: 'A smirking gnome gleefully kicks a good measure of dirt unto a nearby path.'
 
- echo number 15 to: 'A gnome tears a thin sheet from a stem, using it as a protection against the elements.'
 
- echo number 21: 'A gnome waves merrily behind him as it exits through a hole.'
 
- echo number  25: 'A gnome jumps up and down angrily, half-burying itself.'
 
- echo number 26: 'A gnome dashes out of a hole, but its sprint meets an abrupt end when it trips on a small pebble.'
 
I thoroughly enjoyed these echoes, Carole! `-Cristina

    <editfirst>This flowerbed is a mess.  (Though) a few plants are still upright, most lie 
sideways, (their) roots sadly dangling in the air.  The upturn(ed) soil is 
ridden with small, round holes.  The only spared places are the eight stone 
paths, though the stones are disjointed, chirped, and raised in some places. 
 The southern border of this flowerbed, being the Drive from the Hogwarts 
Gates, is left untouched.  To the west, another flowerbed separed (?  
Separates maybe?)  This area from the Hogwarts Castle.  
</editfirst>
    <editfirstcomments>I've lengthened the desc a bit and added echoes.
 
 
Er in fact, I've more than doubled the number of echoes. And in the end, I had trouble fitting the desc into the engine, as it was too long... *feels like bashing her head against her keyboard*.

    <editsecond>This flowerbed is a mess.  Though a few plants are still upright, most lie 
sideways, their roots sadly dangling in the air.  The upturned soil is 
ridden with small, round holes.  The only places that were spared by the 
maniacal author of the many holes are eight stone paths in all directions, 
though the stones are disjointed, chipped, and raised in some places.  The 
southern border of this flowerbed alone, a driveway from the Hogwarts Gates 
to the castle, is left untouched.  To the west, another flowerbed separates 
this area from the Hogwarts Castle.  
</editsecond>
    <editsecondcomments>Also a nearly perfect room here, dear Carole! One thing: after the first editor's finished editing your first draft, she will leave some brackets, meaning that she is only SUGGESTING these additions or changes. Please take out the brackets if you agree with her edits or leave it on and send us a note if you disagree. Thank you, love! `-Cristina

    <desc>All around this area, lush, short, green grass grows during the warmer part 
of the year.  Far off in the distance, a long path leads away east from the 
two high, wooden doors of Hogwarts.  The grass is trimmed to three inches 
here, and every, single blade is a dark green.  The strange statue that 
rises to the north is shaded by the great shadow of the Castle, with its 
great towers.  Flowerbeds seasonally aflame with aromas and vivid colours 
border this patch to the east, northeast, south, and southeast.  Carefully 
mowed lawns provide a less colourful, but nevertheless well-tended view to 
the west and northwest.  What looks like a gigantic raven stands to the

of a large bush.

    <editdraftcomments>Dearest Mike, you have here an overall good room. You have solid imagery and a great overview of what's happening around the patch. I love the fact that you stopped to describe the grass and not simply stopped at just stating it's there. However, you use a lot of passive sentences that all end in &quot;can be seen&quot; or &quot;is visible&quot;. Apart from the fact that they are rather cumbersome and should be avoided, they also give this patch a very formal, uptight form, which is awesome in essays, but will make our readers wince, remembering school days. Therefore, please try to make your sentences active. So not: &quot;a road can be seen&quot; but &quot;a road ambles past&quot;. I've suggested some editing, but you don't per se have to keep to it. If you do make changes, however, do give me a ring, and I'll stop by to edit again. Good work! `-Cristina
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Your echo is absolutely lovely here, dear Mike. Well done! `-Cristina

    <desc>This patch of manicured grass is surrounded on four sides - north, 
northeast, east, and southeast - by flower beds; these miniature-gardens 
gently guard the foot of the castle's wall.  The lawn is so smooth that no 
amount of treading, nor any elemental force holds any sway over it; no 
matter how tousled the blades get, they unfailingly fall back in their 
original place.  The green expands into similar patches to the south, 
southwest, and west.  To the northwest lie peaceful vegetable gardens, and 
beyond them, the greenhouses; these appear to shelter some not-so-peaceful 
plants, as random silhouettes clang against the glass noisily enough to be 
heard even all the way down to this area.  Eight narrow, dirt trails gently 
slither out of this patch, in all directions.  In the centre of this lawn is 
the statue of a man lost in thoughts.

    <editdraftcomments>Ooh, you did very well here, carole.  Just a few commas I think I changed.  
And I really like your sentences about the greenhouses :) 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please change echo number 0 to 'The flowerbeds closeby send a gift of heady scent on the wings of a small breeze.'
 
2) Please change echo number 1 to 'An unholy ruckus is carried by the wind from one of the distant greenhouses.'
 
3) Please change echo number 2 to 'A strong gust of gale ruthlessly manhandles the lawn, but the grass still looks supremely unperturbed.'
 
4) Please change echo number 3 to 'A buzz of insect activity vibrates from the nearby flowerbeds.'

    <editfirstcomments>&quot;This patch of manicured grass is surrounded on four sides, north, 
northeast, east and southeast, by flower beds; the latter stand(s) guard at 
the foot of the Castle's wall with much trepidation.&quot;  In these sentences, 
&quot;latter&quot; refers back to flower beds, which is plural; so shouldn't &quot;stand&quot; 
be left without a &quot;s&quot;?  
</editfirstcomments>
    <editsecond>This patch of manicured grass is surrounded on four sides - north, 
northeast, east, and southeast - by flower beds; these miniature-gardens 
(gently guard the foot of the castle's wall).  The lawn is so smooth that no 
amount of treading, nor any elemental force holds any sway over it; no 
matter how tousled the blades get, they unfailingly fall back in their 
original place.  The green expands into similar patches to the south, 
southwest, and west.  To the northwest lie peaceful vegetable gardens, and 
beyond them, the greenhouses; these appear to shelter some not-so-peaceful 
plants, as random silhouettes clang against the glass noisily enough to be 
heard even all the way down to this area.  Eight narrow, dirt trails gently 
slither out of this patch, in all directions.  In the centre of this lawn is 
the statue of a man lost in thoughts.  
</editsecond>
    <editsecondcomments>1) Yes, in that context, I judged Carole to be right in saying there should be no 's' after 'stand'; however, to prevent all confusion, I replaced 'the latter' by 'these miniature-gardens'. 
 
2) Since a lot of the stuff you described was completely flat and not at all moving, I do not understand where the 'trepidation' comes from at the end of your first sentence. I have given a different reformulation between brackets (please take the brackets out if you agree with it).
 
3) Please use no capitals in the word 'Greenhouses'; this word is not capitolized in the books.
 
Other than that, I have no main points to make. The room has a great deal of detail, which I like very much! Thank you for the hard work! `-Cristina

      <desc>Old age has whitened this man's sculpted beard and has heavily lined his 
face, but by no means has it disfigured him; on the contrary, time lends him 
a lofty air that exudes nobility and wisdom.  Likewise, the man's body has 
weakened and slimmed with the years, but pride still keeps the man's back 
straight and his head high, despite the heavy, imperial crown resting there. 
 In his hand rests a shining, brazen &quot;globus cruciber&quot;; this object is what 
the man sightlessly contemplates, as he wonders and ponders unknown 
mysteries.  A lethal sword and a large shield lie at the old man's feet.  On 
the weapon's scabbard, a rectangle is etched into the leather; inside, the 
figure &quot;IV&quot; is scribbled.

    <desc>Waxed, dark green Mahonia plants grow in this place.  Bright, deep-yellow 
flowers bloom on the branches.  The plantations bloom all through the year.  
The blooms look almost like corn plants.  They spike in groups of seven to 
eight.  The leaves of these evergreen bushes are thin, yet pointed.  A few 
tall trees rise near the plantations to protect them from any powerful 
sunlight.  The dusty ground is covered by a few dried leaves and flowers.  
This flowerbed continues east and southeast.  A beautiful shrubbery lies 
north.  A variety of vegetables mushroom in the land to west, while wide 
grounds open south, southwest, and northwest.

    <desc>This ground is divided in two by a wide, dusty path stretching for the south 
to the north of this patch.  During spring and summer, hawthorn, wild-rose, 
and cabbage-rose shrubs dapple the east part with all the shades of pink, 
from the brilliant, lurid fuchsia to the pale, blushing white: they are used 
mostly by students as a gift to their love interest on Valentine's Day.  In 
autumn and winter, holly shrubs adorn the west with vivid, deep green leaves 
and vibrant, red berries; this part itself is divided in two by a narrow, 
winding, and scratchy path through the holly and out of the patch to the 
west.  All through the year, mistletoe grows on the hawthorn shrubs, in 
strings of pearlescent berries and velvety silver-green.  Those two plants 
serve as decorations come Christmas and New Year's Eve.

    <editdraft>.  In the Hogwarts Grounds are a variety of different flowers, growing 
carelessly across the lawns.  An assortment of blue, gold, green, red, pink, 
purple, white, and black flowers are scattered in every direction.  A 
different fragrance is emitted by each colour of flower, each of which are 
heavenly; blue is the ocean, gold has the aroma of fresh air, green is like 
the forests, red has a hint of fresh roses, pink giving the scent of icing 
on a cake, the purple smells like grape juice, white is easily snow, and 
black is the amazing aftermath of a thunderstorm.  The flowers are arranged 
to form a variety of messages, each which are unique to several different 
colours.  A magic seems to keep these flowers still, as though they were 
dead but alive at the same time.  To the north and east, you see some Smooth 
Lawns, to the south you see an intricate Tall Topiary, to the west is a 
Hidden Trail, northwest is the Emepror Statue, southeast is Gnome-Infested 
Flowerbed, southwest is a grand Low Hedge, and northwest are the Grounds.

    <editdraftcomments>OMG I want the black flower, for real.  Thunderstorms are my favorite!  :D 
if the white one was like a daisy, I would want that one too :) just a few 
adjustments of editing here for you, michael.  Keep up the terrific work!

    <editeds>I did edit your ed here, as it was overly repetitive.  Don't be afraid to

    <editdraftcomments>While we do have a minimum length 4 sentence requirement, and you met that, 
if you feel the urge to write a bit more in here michael, please do.  
Actually, you will need to as I took out your 2nd sentence; it was more 
appropriate as an echo, than in your desc.  :) thanks so much!  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Echoes:
 
1. Please remove the echo, since it has sunlight on it. If players see this echo during a storm, they will be very confused.
 
EDS:
 
1. Please add: 'park' and 'smooth' to the keywords of your 'grass' ed. I have also edited it, so please have a look at it.
 
2. You need an ed of the southwestern bushes (or anything else that you would like to have there and that would hide the hidden trail), telling more careful adventurers that there is an exit there, hidden in the bushes.
</editeds>
    <editfirst>The grass here is (unusually) smooth, and well trimmed also, as though a 
professional cut it.  The sun overhead shines brightly, making the lawn seem 
like a perfect place for a picnic.  Birds fly overheard, and in trees, 
singing their songs happily.  
</editfirst>
    <editsecond>In the warmer part of the year, the grass here is unusually smooth and well 
trimmed, as though cut by a professional.  (The ground beneath is soft and 
dark brown, littered with the occasional twig fallen from one of the few 
trees that are scattered about this otherwise-low park.  In season, the 
northeastern vista drowns in the coloured whirlpool of a Flower Bed, while 
to the south and southeast, the green of soft lawns is fresh and 
overpowering.  At the foot of a southewestern thicket of high bushes, a hint 
of light brown contrasts with the otherwise dark shade of the soil.  The 
scent of vegetables is heavy on any, occasional breeze, coming from the 
north and the northwest.  The park softly bows before an eastern statue, 
while to the west, the grounds explode on, infinite and rich.)  
</editsecond>
    <editsecondcomments>1. Grass does not grow in the winter. Therefore, if you are talking about grass, flowers, or other such 'perishable' things, please write 'In season', 'In the warm seasons', or 'In the warmer part of the year', or suchlike at the beginning of your sentence. If the grass magically survives winter, you have to tell us that.
 
2. I've yanked sentences 2 and 3. Sentence 2 refers to the weather (what happens if there's a storm?) The weather system stands apart from the rest, so make sure you do not mention sun, or unexpected light in a room that is not magically protected. Sentence three has birds in it, and birds do not permanently sing (think of what happens at nightfall!) As a rule, we do not have living things in our descs.
 
3. Thank you for mentioning all the exits! That, indeed, is a crucial part of the desc. However, please do not just list them like you would write items on a shopping list. It is best if you group the like exits together and mention them in full sentences that add to the descriptions.
 
4. You have here a Hidden Trail as an exit. The fact that it is 'hidden' means that it is not so easily visible. Therefore, I hinted only to its presence to the southwest, without mentioning it. You should write now an ed of the southwestern bushes that suggests a possible exit through these bushes. Please do not forget to check my comments in the edsechoes section.

    <desc>A stack of bean plants grow in this piece of land, and to the west, the 
saplings stand erect in the mud without any kind of support.  In season, the 
land often is quite dry and develops a dendrite pattern.  Sweet corn pops up 
in the north; the juicy corn emerges partly from its tender and protective 
covering.  Its golden colour shines like the bright sun.  Heavy watermelons, 
shaded in colours of emerald and pale yellow, rise from the ground to the 
east.  The tones of the peppers enhance this colourful garden.  They are 
draped in shades of olive-green, chrome-yellow, and crimson-red.  This patch 
extends to the west.  The ever-blooming flower beds are to the east and the 
northeast, while dusty grounds stretch to the north, south, southeast, 
southwest, and the northwest.

    <desc>This hill climbs just high enough to allow a decent view of the changing 
colours and landscape of the surrounding grounds.  The mound's sparse 
grasses and shrubs are greener than the dusty lands down to the west, but 
not as vibrant and alive as the gardens to the east, south, southeast and 
southwest.  In the spring, the white and yellow clumps of dandelions 
scattered across the hill stand out brightly and the dark green bushes 
appear to be healthy and strong.  Halfway down the southwest slope stands a 
young apple tree that bears sweet fruit in the summer and whose low, strong 
limbs are ideal for climbing.  The steepest piece of the western slope bears 
a broad streak of lifeless dirt, the scar of sleds in the wintertime.  To 
the northeast and northwest, the grounds continue, and the north leads to a 
greenhouse.

    <editdraft>The glass walls and ceiling of this greenhouse are stained by the magical 
mist that is produced by the various flora throughout the room.  In the 
southeastern corner is a mulch bin giving foul, nose piercing smells from 
its rotting contents.  Next to the mulch bin is a large rubbish bin, 
sticking out from within it is a pair of oddly twisted shears, obviously 
used for something other than what they were made.  Some soil remains from a 
group of untidy first years remains on the table, pushed around in large 
circles in a feeble attempt to clean the table.  Against the wall are great 
stacks of beige, clay flower pots on a set of black, industrial steel 
shelves, not every pot is completely intact, and small shards of clay litter 
the floor around the shelves.  Near the door a large stack of tattered and 
torn books sit, gathering dust on their molding covers.  A singular strand 
of string, with small lanterns hanging from it at a set interval, circles 
the entire room and tapers off behind various posters and a single 
blackboard against the far wall behind a single teaching podium.  To the 
north is the tool storage unit, to the south are the Hogwarts Grounds.

    <editdraft>.  At the back of the greenhouse are a variety of tools used for gardening.  
There are tools such as blades that are used for cutting plant's leaves.  
Also, there are hedgers, used in clipping/designing bushes, and other 
plants.  The tools glitter and glisten, and they are shined to the last inch 
with perfectness.  This room seems to emit an aura that makes it feel like 
it isn't used often.  To the south is Greenhouse One, the front half, and 
north will lead to  Behind the Greenhouse. 
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Overall very well written, just a few tweaks :) 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>1. Please add 'utensils' 'gardening' 'equipment' 'closets' to your ed keywords. Remember to add as many related words as you can reasonably think of.
 
2. Your ed shows all these tools in permanent motion, but there are no trees or plants to be working on (that you mention in the desc). Make echoes of these things leaving to work if you wish, but do not have them working unless you have mentioned that in the desc. I have suggested a rephrase to your ed. Please take a look.

    <editfirstcomments>Hey, guys.  Sorry to intrude, but I wanted to throw in a couple of points.  
1, Michael did put in exits, they just weren't recopied into the 1st draft.  
2, Cristina, I, as always, love your rework of the ed, but I also thoroughly 
enjoy Michael's idea of some of them 'actually' in use.  I'd change the ed 
to something like this: `M&quot;Several tools have taken it upon themselves to work 
around the room.  A spade is taking soil from the compost bin in the 
northeastern corner and placing it into an empty pot.  A pruner is clipping 
back some branches and a watering can sprinkles its precious liquid upon the 
thirsty plants in this room.  Hanging in their wooden closets, the rest of 
these bewitched tools are polished with extreme care, the wooden handles 
smoothly falling into metal or straw ends.  Whether they are hedgers, 
shovels, hoes, rakes or something else, the utensils all, indiscriminately, 
twitch of their own will, impatiently awaiting their call to work.&quot;  `X 3, 
Michael and Cris, I took out the word tiller altogether.  Unless tillers are 
different in Europe (and from my investigation I couldn't find anything 
different than what I know about tillers) they are typically large, and most 
are motorized, but all of them demand a great amount of soil to 'till' up 
from the ground.  There are smaller tillers that have migrated into Europe, 
like here in the States, but they are still larger than what would be used 
in a greenhouse.  Since this is a greenhouse I'm of the opinion that a large 
tiller isn't ripping up the greenhouse floors.  I think that's it.  Thanks 
for the hard work, one and all!  `-tina 
</editfirstcomments>
    <editsecond>Glass surrounds this room, enclosing it within a protective, transparent 
grasp.  Between a high, southern archway and the northern, sealed door, a 
central, stone floor is flanked by a few open closets, filled with a variety 
of gardening tools; some of these are more magical than others.  There are 
blades, scissors, Self-Cleaning mops, shovels, recipients, and hedgers, all 
used in the trimming, clipping, or caring of magical plants.  Although dust 
clings to the foot of the wooden closets, the tools themselves gleam with a 
perfect shine.  The air is dense with the scent of thick soil, and only a 
few footprints are outlined against the dusty floor.  
</editsecond>
    <editsecondcomments>1. Your desc describes the tools and not the rooms. It is good, excellent even, to have a focus to the room, but you have to describe the room, too. Tell us what everything looks like, not only that they have blades and hedgers. 
 
2. Please also remember that this is a magical world. In the books, Harry describes the Greenhouse as one of the more magical bits of Hogwarts, so let's make it that way.
 
3. Please also remember to write down the exits of every room, as players will not have a minimap or a list of exits to be getting along with.
 
4. Your last sentence tells the players how they should feel. Please don't use such sentences. Show that the room isn't used by using its elements; for instance, I have hinted at it with the dust and the footprints. This, of course, is not the only way to do it.
 
5. Although I have eliminated 'perfectness' from the desc, please remember that 'perfectness' is not a word. Please use 'perfection' instead.

</desc>
    <editdraft>.  Behind the Greenhouse is an assortment of things.  Dazzling tools, 
sparkling plants, empty pots and bags upon bags of fertilizer are spread out 
around here.  A tall wooden fence circles around this backyard, protecting 
it from sneaky students that attempt to steal the plants for their own uses. 
 The door back into the greenhouse is glass as well, so the insides of the 
greenhouse and the 'front yard' are visible.  To the north are the Grounds, 
to the east is the Ursa Major, and to the west is an Ancient Yew Tree, while 
to the northeast are more of the Grounds.  In the direction of the 
southeast, one can find themselves between the Greenhouse and Castle, while 
to the southwest lies the Greenhouses, and to the northwest are yet more 
Grounds.  Lastly, in a southerly direction is the back half of Greenhouse 
One.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Michael, I've noticed in a few of your rooms that you repeat things a lot, 
instead of mixing it up a bit.  :) so I've changed a bit of your wording to 
make it less monotonous.  If you have any objections, please let me know :) 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Echoes:
 
1. Please edit your echo to: 'One of the flower pots gives a small hiccough.'
 
EDS:
 
1. I like the idea of this ed and the way you wrote it, but I have changed the fence that you have, so please yank the ed away. You can't have a fence blocking all the exits, since you've written in the desc, and it is materially present on the MUD, that exits DO exist. Now, if you would like to write an ed about the magical fences I have suggested, please, please do, and then send another 2nd Draft note.
 
COMMENTS:
 
1. We NEVER use 'you' or other second-person pronouns in our descs and echoes. You MAY, if you wise, use it for an ed, but never for the other two.

    <editfirst>Behind the Greenhouse (is) an assortment of things.  Dazzling tools, 
sparkling plants, empty pots and bags upon bags of fertilizer are spread out 
around here.  A tall wooden fence circles around this backyard, protecting 
it from sneaky students that attempt to steal the plants for their own uses. 
 The door back into the greenhouse is glass as well, so the insides of the 
greenhouse and the 'front yard' are visible.  To the north are the Grounds, 
to the east is the Ursa Major, (and) to the west is an Ancient Yew Tree, 
(while) to the northeast are more of the Grounds.  (In the direction of) the 
southeast, (one) can find (themselves between) the Greenhouse and Castle, 
(while) to the southwest (lies the) Greenhouses, (and) to the northwest are 
yet more Grounds.  (Lastly, in a southerly direction) is (the back half of) 
Greenhouse One.  
</editfirst>
    <editsecond>Behind a southern greenhouse lies an assortment of things.  Dazzling tools, 
sparkling plants, empty pots, and bags upon bags of fertilizer are spread 
out (on the well-trodden earth) here.  Each, lovely plant is protected by a 
magical fence that will repel any sneaky student attempting to steal from 
this supply.  The southern door into Greenhouse 1 is made of glass, allowing 
a peek at the more prominent plants inside.  To the north and northeast 
stretch smooth grounds, while to the east stands a most impressive statue.  
A scent of bitter yew wafts in the air, probably originating from a rather 
impressive, western yew tree.  Wide, low paths to the southwest and 
southeast trace the border between two greenhouses and between Greenhouse 1 
and Hogwarts Castle, respectively.  
</editsecond>
    <editsecondcomments>1. I like the idea of having this as an extra storage for the greenhouses. However, the fence you have put around this area would block most exits which, nevertheless, exist. Therefore, I have removed the general fence and put small fences around the plants, since those were more likely to be stolen.
 
2. You have a few general, grammatical mistakes here. I will list the more important of these under this point: a) in a list of more than 2 items we always place a comma before the 'and'; b) We always use commas between adjectives that address the same noun, for instance 'tall, wooden' rather than 'tall wooden'; c) Please be careful how you phrase the description. You used here 'the door back into the greenhouse is glass AS WELL', without having anything made of glass here before. This will make players read the desc again and again, trying to catch something that isn't there; d) While Hogwarts Grounds, Greenhouse 1, Hogwarts Castle are names and should all be capitolized, the nouns 'grounds', 'greenhouse', and 'castle' are common nouns and should NOT be capitolized. Therefore, if you do not have a Hogwarts or otherwise another element that would suggest a name, please use uncapitolized letters.
 
3. Since the greenhouses contain a lot of plants probably swarming everywhere, I doubt that you could see all the way through the greenhouse into a front yard or suchlike.
 
4. Please do not declare areas or exits by their names. For rooms that have been written, try reading their descriptions and thus picking an element that would suggest what they look like. For instance, saying 'to the east is the Ursa Major' would baffle me, since how can you have a constellation on the ground? Are you giving cardinal directions here? If you had walked into that room, you would have seen that the Ursa Major is a statue. Also, as I have asked in one of my previous edits, do not list the exits like on a shopping list and try to group alike exits together. Thank you for describing the exits, however!

    <desc>Big trees grow infinitely tall to the corners of this patch of earth.  They 
look like burly figures with extra-large, bushy, strong hands that can hold 
a human in it.  A wooden fence separates the trees from the path.  The road 
is unlevelled; to the north, it is slightly uplifted, while to the south, 
it's a slope.  This place provides home to the small beings of nature, like 
birds, insects, rabbits, and squirrels etc.  The place has a completely 
different beauty in it.  Most people avoid coming here after sunset, as 
there is a danger of perilous animals coming this way in the night.  Quite 
nearby, to the north, northeast, and northwest, is the Forbidden Forest.  
Never-ending grounds extend to the east, south, west, southeast, and 
southwest.

every shy blade of withered grass, with every grain of dark, rough soil, 
with every thin, moaning branch.  Shadows of scents, sometimes musty, 
sometimes sweet and heavy, linger for moments before a screaming gust of 
wind sends them away.  The earth is ruffled in circular patterns that sketch 
the likeness of a hurricane with an eye around a patch of four oaks.  Tiny 
grass cowers in fear across the ground, no taller than a few inches, 
motionless and pained like the green blood of the whipped soil.  The 
permanent storms are strongest around the trees and fade towards the 
vegetable gardens north, west, northeast, and northwest.  Similarly clear of 
the screaming tempest are the grounds to the east, south, southwest, and 
southeast, basking underneath the steadfast wall of Hogwarts Castle.

      <desc>Each of these four trees is not more than ten feet high.  Their trunks grow 
sideways in knots and knobbles rather than erect towards the sky, tormented 
by ages of storms and winds.  Across the bark are long wounds, probably dug 
out by the insistent pound of a heavy rain.  Despite their ordeal, the trees 
do not bow their heads; instead, their arms rise without complaint in 
whatever direction the tempests allow it.  Wherever the branches of one tree 
reach another, they close in a comforting, brotherly embrace.

    <desc>This part of land is purely magical; spells and enchantments keep the place 
warm for the coffee plantations developing here.  The plants are about two 
feet tall, with slender branches and thick leaves.  The veins on them are 
clearly visible.  Marshy and slippery soil covers the ground.  Cherry-red 
fruit grow in bunches on the topmost branches.  They are juicy and sweet to 
taste.  The flowers emerge from the branches together with the leaves, and 
have a jasmine-like scent.  Some seeds lie scattered and crushed on the 
ground, exuding the smell of strong coffee.  Some of these lie scattered on 
the ground.  A protective dome five feet high shields them from direct 
sunlight.  This garden extends towards the east, west, and the southwest, 
while dusty grounds roll open out in all other directions.

    <desc>This piece of land is flat and dusty.  Small sprigs of grass try to grow 
through the dirt, but their brittleness and pale brown colour show that 
their efforts are failing.  Only a few prickly weeds thrive on the surface 
of the ground.  The greens of the gardens to the south, southeast, and 
southwest contrast sharply with this less fertile plot.  The most lively 
piece of nature here is a small willow sapling; somehow it is surviving and 
growing much better than the lawn around it.  It is thin and only three feet 
tall, but it stands straight and its dark leaves are vibrant and healthy.  
The dry plain continues to the north and west.  A small hill climbs to the 
east.

    <editdraft>.  In between the greenhouses are a variety of different plants.  There are 
blue plants as small as a rat, and red plants as tall as the greenhouse 
itself.  Intricate designs are on many of the plants, including swirls 
around petals, and zigzag lines across stems.  Beside the plants is a bag 
with the words 'Jayce's Magical Grow' on it.  The bag is open halfway, and 
the top half of the bag is flatter then the bottom half.  Enchanted mist 
falls on the plants every now and then, to give them enough water to survive 
the day.  To the north you will find yourself Between Greenhouses, to the 
south you can find The Grounds, to the southeast are the Hogwarts Grounds, 
and to the southwest is the magnificent Flagstone Entry to the Greenhouse.

    <editdraftcomments>Wow!  I like this room a lot.  That bag of plant growth is really creative 
to add in here :) I made just a few tweaks.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Echoes:
 
1. Please replace your echo by: 'An enchanted mist gathers out of thin air above the plants, dampening them for a few moments before it disappears.'
 
ED:
 
I have edited your ed of 'bag'. Please take a look whenever you have the time.
 
COMMENTS
 
In your ed, I put the second and fourth sentences together, as I thought they sounded better this way, since they were related. Please tell me if you have any comments or objections.

    <editsecond>In between the greenhouses is a variety of different plants, from rat-sized, 
blue bushes to red trees as tall as the buildings themselves.  Intricate 
designs, including swirls around various petals and zigzagging lines across 
some stems, ornate much of the surrounding, local flora.  Beside the plants 
is a bag with the words 'Jayce's Magical Grow' on it.  The bag is halfway 
open and its top half is flatter then the bottom half.  Beneath the bag and 
scattered across this patch of earth, rich, dark soil slithers all the way 
between the glass walls of the greenhouses, giving in to some seasonal, 
green grass to the south, southwest, and southeast.  This broad path 
continues northward.  
</editsecond>
    <editsecondcomments>I've tweaked the description here and there. You have a small tendency of repeating some words, so I tried to go around that. This desc was very good, except for the shopping-list approach to the exits and the usage of the second-person pronoun. Please do not use 'You' except in eds. `-Cristina

      <desc>. The bag of Magical Grow is filled halfway with what seems to be fertilizer. 
Half of the contents are missing, as though some of it has been used 
already. The Magical Grow fertilizer seems to be a green and brown color 
mixed, giving it a pukish essence. Whatever the fertilizer does, it seems to 
work because most of the plants are already ten feet tall! 
 
The bag of Magical Grow is halfway filled with what appears to be fertilizer. The substance is coloured a sickly mixture of green and brown that approaches the tinge of vomit. Half of the contents are missing, and to good effect, it would seem, since many of the plants are at least ten feet tall already!

    <editdraft>.  This area smells strongly of a forest, most likely because the Forbidden 
Forest is up ahead.  The sun makes the dew on the grass glisten beautifully, 
and the wind causes it to blow slightly.  The greenhouses that stand on 
either side of the path reflect the sun magnificently.  Off in the distance, 
a faint song can be heard, sounding much like a crude baby screaming, and at 
the same time, like a professional opera singer.  Ahead up north can be 
found an Ancient Yew Tree, and to the south is still an area between 
Greenhouses, as well as towards the northeast and northwest.

    <editfirstcomments>About the desc: Shouldn't &quot;radiates&quot; be &quot;radiate&quot;?  It's the five lanes which radiate, not the area.
 
 
About the yew edit: you can find the definition of lanceolate here:http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/lanceolate . I've kept &quot;leaves&quot;; as it is a plural, I've kept &quot;measure&quot; without an &quot;s&quot;. All other suggestions were duly noted, accept for &quot;seen&quot; to replace &quot;glanced&quot;: instead I used &quot;glimpsed&quot;.

      <desc>This yew tree's proportions are exceptional: up to eighty feet in height, it 
is also ten feet wide.  Other than that, the tree displays the usual 
characteristics of a yew.  The evergreen, lanceolate leaves measure a couple 
of millimeters in width, and from half an inch to an inch and a half in 
length; they are interspersed with translucent-red berries.  Beneath all the 
leaves and berries, dark-brown bark can be glimpsed from time to time.  At 
the foot of the tree, barely visible under the branches, a bronze plaque is 
embedded in the earth.

    <desc>This part of the grounds is quite chilly.  The surrounding vegetation 
absorbs most of the heat and makes the path pleasant.  Tall trees to the 
sides bend the ground like hunchbacks.  A large, pine tree to the right is 
the centre of attraction.  The ground is covered in pine cones, they are 
artistically shaped by nature.  Its deep, mystic, and pleasant smell spreads 
through the woods.  Any time darkness settles in, the place looks full of 
burly figures, shadows of the plants, and numerous insects that crawl on the 
wet ground.  On a clear night, the patch is perfect for a midnight walk, 
with the beams of starlight gleaming on the pebbles like the milky way.  
These grounds further extend east, south, west, southeast, and southwest.  
The Forbidden Forest lies north, northeast, and northwest.

    <desc>Lustrous, shiny, and attractive tomatoes emerge out of the fertile and damp 
soil.  The fruits have the size of a giant compared to ones grown in a 
regular, Muggle garden; their sepals are exactly like a king's crown.  Most 
are pale green, shaded in streaks of chrome; a few ripe ones have fallen on 
the ground.  The fresh buds look like tiny tots, while the older ones seem 
to be their parents.  Slender stems and delicate leaves comprise this 
creeper; they grow in all directions like long, slimy snakes.  In day time, 
the sun plays hide and seek with the fluffy clouds which are like cotton 
balls etched against the sky, hovering in all directions.  The plants 
stretch in the direction of the heavens as though pleading for something.  
Their shade covers the earth in a variety of designs and shapes.  This 
vegetable garden casts its magical spell east, south, west, and southwest, 
whilst vast grounds extend in all other directions like a bowl of dust.

    <editdraft>.  Gigantic stones are neatly placed on the ground here.  They create a 
walkway that leads straight to the Greenhouse.  The stones are dirty with 
mud, in the shapes of footprints.  Trees grow on either side of the walkway, 
creating the image of a fairy-tale road.  To the east are the Grounds, to 
the south, southeast, and southwest are some Vegetable Gardens, while to the 
west is a Peaceful Courtyard.  The northeast leads to an area between some 
Greenhouses, to the north is the Front Half of Greenhouse Two, and to the 
northwest is the Retta Tunnel.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>I like this room a lot, it feels very outdoorsy :) you don't need to 
capitalize Between for Between Grounds...  That's just the name of the room, 
and it always gets capitalized, but it's just for reference, if that makes 
sense.  
</editdraftcomments>

    <editdraft>.  This greenhouse is unlike the first one; it has much more advanced plants 
that are probably as big as the students are! An Abyssinian shrivelfig is 
visible on one of the many shelves that surround this greenhouse, as are 
honking daffodils, puffapods, screech snaps, and leaping toadstools.  Among 
all of these, the most menacing seems to be none other than the Venomous 
Tentacula!  Some of the plants bite ominously when approached, and others 
just purr lightly like a kitten, as though they could cause no harm.  To the 
north is the back half of Greenhouse Two, and in a southern direction is the 
flagstone entry to the Greenhouse.   
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Aww, I really like this room!  How cute these plants are, even the mean 
ones, hehe.  :) I think I'd like herbology, if it were a real class.  
Anyway, nothing too major changed here, just a few grammar tweaks, good work 
michael!

      <desc>This spiky, dark red plant has malicious teeth. Its vines will reach out 
toward any person, to hold them down while it sinks its teeth into the body. 
The venom injected will spread very quickly, often causing severe pain and

    <editdraft>.   Poisonous spike balls begin flying from every direction here!  They come 
from the shelves on the walls at full force towards the glass sliding door.  
Green venom can be found on the wooden walls of the supply shed.  Alongside 
the glass walls are growing plants that seem to have been given up on, for 
they are untidy and withering.  To the south is the front half of Greenhouse 
Two, and off to the north leads behind the Greenhouse. 
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>This room is also very good :) my one comment is that you said 'untidy and 
messy.  ' those both mean the same thing.  So for the first word, please 
pick one or the either, and then for your second word, I gave you some 
suggestions to supplant your redundant word.  If you have something better, 
please feel free to throw it in :) these were just off the top of my head.

    <editdraft>.  A field of decaying plants fill the area.  Dead plants, piles of venom, 
and blood can be seen everywhere.  The remains of the plants create a foul 
stench so strong that one can hardly breathe.  The smell causes the eyes to 
water, and create the need to get through this area as fast as possible.  In 
a northern direction, one can find the Grounds, eastward is an Ancient Yew 
Tree, and to the west is a large patch of Mallowsweet.  Off to the northeast 
and northwest, the Grounds are visible, while in the direction of southeast 
is the path that leads to between the Greenhouse.  In a southwest direction 
is a Ratta Tunnel, and the vast view of the back half of Greenhouse Two 
fills the area to the south.

    <editdraftcomments>I really enjoyed reading this room too, michael, you definitely have a gift 
for writing outdoors :) one comment though, you always throw in at least 4-5 
exits into 1 sentence.  It makes it very difficult to read as you repeat 
yourself with everyone (i.  E.  To the north is (blank), to the south is 
(blank), etc.)  I would suggest only putting in a maximum of 3 exits per 
sentence, and use some creativity to distinguish between them, it'll be more 
fun to the reader :) thanks so much!  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>I did edit your ed here.  We always write in present tense here on the MUD, 
so that's why I've changed your 'decayed's to 'decaying' if you're wondering 
:) take care!  `-mira

    <desc>Sturdy trees stand like tall pillars to the sides of this patch.  They are 
quite near each other and look like a huge, joint family.  A few of these 
possess medicinal properties.  When they shed their leaves, it seems like 
they are showering down pearls of wisdom.  Their bark is thick, tough, and 
brownish-black; its fibres are excellent for making parchment.  A small, 
wooden board hangs on each of them, specifying their names and importance.  
Lovers choose this place for its romantic solitude.  To the north, 
northeast, and northwest lies the Forbidden Forest, where most of the 
students fear to trespass.  Vast, open grounds spread, welcoming, to the 
east, south, west, southeast, and southwest.

    <desc>The castle northwestern tower stands to the southeast.  A narrow path to the 
south sets this part of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry apart 
from the greenhouses to the southwest.  More trails lead to the east and 
west, to more grounds as well as to the northeast, north, and northwest 
towards the Forbidden Forest.  The white, marble statue of a huge she-bear 
and her cub is attached to the tower, looking up and slighty north.  
Strangely, a large dipper is set by their paws.

    <desc>Sweet chirps, melodious tunes, and pleasant songs greet the ears on entering 
this patch of land.  Settled upon the tall branches of nearby trees are the 
nests of the small, feathery singers who dwell in this land.  A few weeds 
emerge out the earth and grow about three feet tall.  Their golden colour 
looks like a ripe mango.  They provide a cosy home to all the tiny beings 
such as ants, rodents, and rats.  The ground is invisible under a cover of 
plants.  A rickety, wooden board hangs on one of the nearby trees, 
indicating directions out of this land.  It is commonly believed amongst 
students that any wish made with a true heart comes true in this place.  The 
Forbidden Forest occupies the horizon to the north, northeast, and 
northwest.  Vast grounds open out east, south, west, southeast, and 
southwest.

    <editdraft>A gentle slope coated in tall green grass rises up on all sides to form an 
almost perfectly round knoll.  A dirt path, rather than go around the hill, 
cuts straight over it, dividing the circular rise into two semi-circles.  
Planted almost directly in the centre of the hill, but off to each side of 
the path, are two sycamore trees, providing shade for a generous portion of 
the rise.  Blue and yellow wildflowers are planted in strategic lines, 
starting around the base of the hill and moving upwards till the very tip of 
the mound is inside a circle of yellow blossoms.  The grass around the base 
of the slope has been worn down from students opting to travel around, 
rather than go over, the hill.  A myriad of flowers from a patch of ground 
directly north spills over to the knoll, creeping up to the beginning of the 
slope, while the trees northwest of the hill provide some shade.  The 
yellow-gold heads of sunflowers peek out from the northeast, while a stream 
burbles to the east and a bear statue overlooks the hill from the west.  A 
distant line of shadowy trees is visible in the far north.

    <editdraftcomments>hey chris :) I put in comma's to separate your 3 items in your first sentence, and took out the comma before providing because you don't need it, and since things are worn down 'by' and not 'by' an object, I've changed that as well :) in your sentence with the myriad flowers, it was a bit repetitive, so it's been re-worded. please let me know if you have concerns over that, same with the sunflower sentence that follows. other than that, thanks for your hard work and keep the rooms coming!
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Your echo here was just fine, :) and I changed ever so slightly the ending 
of your ed to make it more clear.  You are very good with writing 
descriptively :) last thing, as our system picks up commands as quick as 
they can, you don't need 'tree trees' in your keywords.  Just trees will do 
(keeping it plural will still allow the player to see the ed if they type 
the singular, for instance) thanks so much!  `-mira

    <desc>Lush-green, soft, fluffy bushes flourish to the sides of this path.  The 
flowers blooming on them seem to carry an exotic smile on their pretty 
faces.  Blossoms like marigold, periwinkle, and rose grow here.  To the 
south is a small pond; the multicoloured reflection of these blooms is 
visible in the crystal blue water.  Tiny fish shine like gold and diamond 
whenever any sunlight pierces through the surface, into the water.  The soil 
near the waterside is marshy.  The footing is quite slippery and dangerous 
here; the soil is all set to send passers by into the relatively shallow 
pond.  For fun, students make sketches or etch their names on the trunks of 
the tall, tough trees lying south.  The Forbidden Forest to the north, 
northeast, and northwest casts a strange look on anyone who passes in its 
direction.  Endless grounds expand east, south, west, southeast, and 
southwest.

    <desc>The wall rounds a corner, heading east and northwest, its edges rounded by 
old age and constant exposure to the elements.  Ivy grasps the stone 
lovingly, its vines stretched over the entire surface of the stone barrier, 
giving an odd, opaque, silver-coloured shine to the dark granite.  Patches 
of trees grow by its side, stretching towards it, entangling with the vines. 
 To the northeast, beyond the magnificence of the tall Quidditch Pitch, 
rises Hogwarts Castle: a miracle of serenity and reassurance with turrets 
plunging sharply into the sky.  Opposite the wall, tears of blood line the 
grass in the shape of passionate rose beds.  To the south, the whisper of 
water announces the presence of the school lake, surrounded by willows and 
rocks.  A deep sweetness hangs in the air, thickly mixing with the freshness 
coming from the carpet of grass tinselled with bushes that spreads over the 
lovely grounds.

the interior and made of beige sandstone on the outside.  Banners, forgotten 
after a vicious match, hang high amongst the seats, flapping occasionally 
with the wind.  Two, large archways are visible on the edge of the arena 
that runs parallel to the Hogwarts Wall.  At about the same level, on the 
inside, are two groups of three hoops each, the tips of which are just 
distinguishable in the distance, slightly dented from frequent usage.

elegant plant, while its leaves are pointed and waxed.  Needles reach out in 
all directions, edging from the tips of the leaves and making it look like a 
dangerous creature, throbbing with the wild rhythm of life.

    <desc>Worn and weather-beaten, the dignified, high wall has smooth, rounded edges 
to the east, visible even in their close wrapping of slender, young vines.  
On its western half, however, the stone is chipped and scarred by the 
branches of old trees, so thick together that they allow no view of the 
village beyond.  Pulsating and stretching atop the rough surface, the 
silvery ivy reaches up to the closest of the pack of branches, drawing them 
nearer in a strange web of grey and brown.  In a much stronger imitation of 
the nearby oaks, a large, forbidding forest covers the entire horizon to the 
north, swallowing the wall in hungry jaws.  To the east, beyond the shadow 
of the magnificent Quidditch Pitch, are rose beds, lavishly reaching upward 
towards the sky.  The air is thick with the sweet scents erupting from 
around the peaceful Lake to the south.  Gently sliding towards the northwest 
and to the southeast, the wall surrounds the grounds in a loose half-circle 
that ends before the forest and at the foot of the Lake.

      <desc>Willows bend gently over the water, their image rippling very slightly as 
they prod its clear surface.  Rocks of all sizes are gathered without a 
pattern, tenderly protecting the sides of millions of small paths leading to 
the waterside.  Nimbuses of light erupt over the entire Lake at the

      <desc>The gentle, soothing vines of the silvery ivy slither gently against the 
smooth surface of the wall, stretching hungrily in all directions.  Their 
leaves are oval and waxed, sharpened at the tips and ending in thin needles. 
 A soft puff of fur is visible upon the silky fingers of the plant, soft and 
delicate, whispering softly with the slightest of breezes.  The plant throbs 
in a violent rhythm of life.

    <desc>Sunflowers bloom in this dry and clean patch of land.  The flowers have an 
enchanting loveliness in them.  Stranded on the thin, weak stems, these 
beauties look around in all directions, challenging all the other living 
beings to match them.  The sunflowers hold its head high up in pride.  The 
orange streaks on the yellow, silky petals look like electric sparks against 
the plain surface.  The roots hide deep underground, like ostriches.  In the 
middle of the flower bed is a clean path leading out of this maze-like 
garden.  Segregated far apart from this land to the north, northeast, and 
northwest is the mysteriously deep Forbidden Forest.  Vast grounds extend 
like the infinite sky towards east, south, west, southeast, and southwest.

    <editdraft>Here, a small stream burbles up from a small hole in the ground and cascades 
down a slight hill for a stretch.  At the point where the narrow dirt path 
intersects the little rivulet, a tiny bridge has been built over it.  A 
small plaque is attached to one end of the bridge.  Over it, the path winds 
on into the distance.  The stream travels on for a bit more before plunging 
back into the earth via another hole.  The area immediately surrounding the 
small brook is mostly sandy soil, which eventually gives way to a lush 
carpet of vivid green grass.  To the north, a row of imposing trees in the 
distance casts a shadow over the grounds, including the sunflower patch to 
the north, the small sandalwood forest to the northeast, and the 
wildflower-covered land to the northwest.  The ground rises up in a hillock 
west of the stream, while the land east is inhabited by a cluster of cherry 
trees.

    <editdraftcomments>Chris, I only had tiny adjustments for your room here.  It's a pretty nice 
description for an outdoors room.  Almost takes me out of this bad mood I'm 
in :)

    <editeds>Wow, I like the use of treacherous in the echo, and your ed made me smile.  
No edits here, nice work.  `-mira

    <desc>A mass of sandalwood trees occupy this land; their deep fragrance spreads 
through the mystical air.  The deciduous plants spread their snake-like 
branches overhead.  The land is quite hard, stiff, and dry.  Footprints of 
passers-by are not erased easily once they are etched on the earth.  Layers 
and layers of dust cover the pretty, olive-green leaves like envelopes.  
Students like to make funny pictures on their bark; the rough and tough 
trunks look like decorated and carved pieces of wood.  Girls often sneak in 
here to collect the tiny pieces of sandalwood, which they use to smear on 
their faces to enhance their beauty.  Fresh vegetables nurture in the 
fertile land to the southeast.  Infinite grounds lie east, south, west, and 
southwest, while the dense, creepy, and frightening Forbidden Forest lies 
north, northeast, and northwest.

wonderful view. The cherry trees are common in the Muggle World, but of 
course they don't know of the spetacular uses. Holly trees are in the Muggle 
World too, but more rare.

    <desc>The statue of a woman is nestled in an indentation of the castle's wall 
facing north, towards the Forbidden Forest.  The wall is grey, whereas the 
statue leaning against it is white with a cerulean sheen.  Her striking, 
feathered, white wings are connected to her shoulder blades and are allowed 
free rein by her open-backed, strapless, heart-shaped dress.  A silver band, 
no more than a thread of metal, holds her wavy mass of hair in a semblance 
of order.  A gauze ribbon circles her slender, regal neck and finds its 
counterpart in the gauze strap which defines and lets the rest of the gown 
flows smoothly to the ground.  Arm-length gloves complete her outfit.  From 
where she stands four paths winds to the northwest, north, northeast, and 
east.

    <desc>Shocking pink rose bushes stand to the north of this patch of land.  The 
flowers are shaded in pure white and look like coral designs on a velvet 
carpet.  They hold their heads high up showing its beauty to every single 
living element.  When any dew settles upon its delicate petals and stem, it 
looks like pretty women wearing necklaces of pearls and diamonds.  The piece 
of earth looks like a jewellery shop.  A stone bench is situated next to the 
bushes; the old as well as the young, enjoy moving about this pretty place.  
Quite different from the man-made world, the atmosphere here is quite serene 
and quiet.  Spooky forests lie north, northeast, and northwest; wild, 
carnivorous animals haunt this place.  A drizzling sound of water is heard 
from the southeast where the waterside lies.  An entire patch dedicated to 
nurturing fresh, juicy, and colourful vegetables lies south, while unbounded 
grounds stretch east, west, and southwest.

    <desc>A tall, evergreen wall of privet surrounds a square patch, huddled and 
rustled briskly.  Little, house-elf-sized bowers adorned every exit, in the 
centre of each wall and in every corner, save the southeast one.  All sorts 
of succulent-looking vegetables, tomatoes, salads, the thick tufts of 
carrots, bathe in the warm sunlight during the day and lay dormant at night. 
 A trickle of water gently winds its way in the little grooves of the black, 
rich soil.

    <copyright>Copyright © 2004-2010  Project Legilimensia</copyright>
    <desc>This patch of dirt, set in a recess of the castle's outer wall to the 
southwest, south, and east sides, faces the Forbidden Forest to the north.  
In the angle between the walls leans a polished, black statue of a woman.  
Her straight hair is kept from her pretty face and fanged, plum mouth by a 
simple headband.  The halter neck of her dress leaves her back exposed, 
allowing her bat-like wings to extend to their full span.  A leather pouch 
dangles from the large, leather belt that adorns the heavy, rich gown.  The 
final detail of her attire consists of elbow-length gloves.  From where the 
robe pools around her feet, four lanes start to the west, northwest, north, 
and northeast.

    <copyright>Copyright © 2006  Carole Vaudry &lt;Vaudry2@hotmail.com&gt;</copyright>
    <desc>This patch of land is occupied by a small, yet beautiful lake, in which the 
water shines like a silver mirror.  Thirsty passers-by quench their dry 
throats over here.  Surrounded by trees on all sides, this place is like a 
'green heaven'.  The long branches slide into the water; it looks like they 
are washing their lovely, long hair in it.  The students like to sit on the 
edge of the wooden bridge whose foundation extends into the depth of the 
lake.  Silver coloured fish shine like tiny stars on the surface; they form 
sparkling, lattice-like formations that move in different directions.  
Another waterside is situated south.  The dense, scary forest starts from 
the north, northeast, and northwest, extending to no specific destination.  
Fresh vegetables mushroom to the southeast; quite nearby to the southwest, 
lies another patch, where poisonous vegetables await someone to pick them.  
The grounds extend widely to the east and west.

gorse on the east side and a wall of privet on the west side, each 
presenting a way out through the trees.  The north is an open vista to the 
eyes and offers way to the north, northeast and northwest grounds.  On the 
other hand, the Forbidden Forest blocks most of the south way, except for a 
nascent, almost obliterated path in the southwest corner.

    <desc>Trickling in from a northern forest, a tiny brook slithers down to a 
westward pond.  Barely visible, this thin stream is unfortunate enough to 
vanish during the summer months, though during the winter it flourishes with 
life.  A glistening, elf-sized lake joins with the tiny brook here.  Hidden 
mostly by foliage, the water's dribbling sound gives away its existence.  
Small creatures find this the ideal place to draw a sweet drink, while 
sparrows find pleasure in taking a bath in the slow, stream flow.  To the 
south, a poisonous vegetable patch flourishes from the stream's ground 
water; noxious weeds adorn the southeast of the brook.  A thick forest lies 
ominously to the north, northeast, and northwest; whispering continuously 
nearby, a crystalline lake lies westward, and another, to the southwest.  A 
clump of dense bushes crowd the eastern vista.

    <editdraftcomments>Allison, this room is just breathtakingly beautiful.  I absolutely love it!  
:D great work, no edits.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Echoes:
 
1. Please change echo number 0 to: 'A small bird splashes itself in the shallow, cold water.'
 
Eds:
 
1) Please add 'stream' to the ed of brook. I have edited this ed (just small tweaks), so please check it out when you have the time.
 
2) I tweaked the ed of 'pond' a bit, so please check it out some time. 
 
Comments:
 
I particularly loved the last two sentences of your 'pond' ed. They were great. Well, well done!

    <editsecondcomments>Your desc is almost perfect, lovely Allison; I love this gift of yours of putting life in your descs. Only two more important points:
 
1. You tend to repeat words, such as 'brook'. Please try to find synonims for it, so that the desc sounds even fresher and more beautiful.
 
2. You only mentioned two of the eight exits. Please, please mention ALL the exits. The players will not have access to the minimap, nor to an exit list, therefore they are dependant on your descriptions to find their way through. To easily know where this room has exits, please type: exit.

    <desc>Gorses contort and entwine themselves in a spiny hedge, delimiting a square 
patch.  However, some bright-yellow flowers soften the plant's outline all 
through the year, as is common in gorse.  The west, north, and east walls 
are pierced with organic penings: two gorses stand a foot or so apart and 
join their twisted branches three feet up in the air.  The northwest and 
northeast corners present tree-free gaps large enough for a man to pass 
through.  This patch is riddled with hemlock, hellebore, belladonna, and 
other venomous plants, all arranged in neat, ordered rows: their fragrance 
mingles with that of the tilled earth to give off a agreeable if not 
surprising smell.

    <editdraft>About five clusters of bushes can be found here, in a strangely organized 
circle. The bushes bear fruit of a breed of hellabore and a normal muggle 
bush. The fruits release the stench of a swamp, causing discomfort. A pale 
green haze is visible in this circle of bushes, perhaps caused by the 
unnatural contents in the bushes. To the north and northwest can be found 
the Forest, eastward is a Winter Statue, in a southern direction are some 
Noxious Weeds, on the westside is a Tiny Brook, in the direction of 
northeast is the Waterside, a Poisonous Vegetable Patch fills the southwest 
side, and lastly to the southeast is a large beech tree.

      <desc>This bush seems to have been breeded with a muggle bush and a hellabore. The 
fruits on the bush contain the same essence of hellabore of the natural 
plant, but emits a disgusting smell that the real hellabore doesn't. It is 
also hard to ignore the green haze that is coming from it...

    <desc>In season, this patch of weeds is a fest of warm-coloured flowers, in tinges 
of deep-red, flame-orange, and sunny-yellow.  The dark-green and 
emerald-hued leaves of the three species of weeds offer a perfect background 
for the vivid inflorescence.  Although gorgeous, the plants forebode well 
the Forbidden Forest, which bars the northern and northwestern vistas; 
indeed, two thirds of the wild thicket, made up of ragworts and broad-leaved 
docks, can be slightly poisonous if absorbed in large quantities.  The third 
plant, a trumpet vine, climbs up a dark-grey castle which stands to the 
south and southeast, damaging the stone wall in the process.  Moisture 
gathers in this area from the lake that lies to the east and northeast.  
Seven paths are cleared of weeds, allowing a glimpse of the rich soil 
around; the ways run in every direction except the southwest.

    <editdraftcomments>Lovely aruna!  :) so sorry it's taken me a while to get to these edits.  I 
just added a few commas, took out one, and removed some of the extra wording 
I felt wasn't necessary.  Very good work, though!  I like your desc of the 
flowers.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>EDS:
 
1) Please add 'vines' and take out 'vine' from the keyowrds of 'trumpet'.
 
2) I've edited all eds. Mostly it's a matter of small tweaks, but if I had comments, I've added them.

    <editsecondcomments>I've just made a few tweaks and minor adjustments to the desc. However, I was confused by your usage of 'docks' as the title of a plant. As far as I know, docks are places where boats are anchored; if, however, if there exists a plant with this name that I am unaware of, please feel free to keep the term.

      <desc>This plant is mostly recognizable by its large, dark, slightly-serrated 
leaves.  Clusters of small, round flowers grow along a single stalk, forming 
racemes.  Early on, the inflorescences are lime-green, but as time passes, 
they change to a blood-red.  The flowers are eventually replaced by 
reddish-brown seeds.  As the qualification &quot;weed&quot; implies, this plant is 
extremely difficult to completely uproot and get rid of.

      <desc>This weed can grow up to seven feet high.  The leaves are fern-like, 
multiple lobes developing symmetrically along a long stem.  The flowers can 
measure up to an inch in width; they form dense, flat-topped clusters of 
bright-yellow, sun-shaped flowers.  Whatever the season, the plant lets off 
a strong, unpleasant smell, thus reminding everyone of its toxicity.

      <desc>Warmth exudes from the twisting tentacles of these vines; a spell has 
probably been cast either on the plant itself or on the patch to keep this 
more tropical weed alive through Scotland's frosts.  There is nothing frail, 
however, about the appearance of this plant, which would probably be able to 
recover even from a hard winter.  The inflorescences stand out strongly with 
their red or orange petals, yellowish throats, and trumpet shapes; the 
flowers contrast beautifully with the vine's emerald or dark-green leaves.  
The stems are woody and thumb-thick; from them, tendrils extend along the 
Castle's wall and anchor into the stones and joints.  Consequently, cement 
dust, and stone crumbs gather in the leaves and flowers, and litter the 
ground near the plant's roots.

    <desc>Eight paths stream from all cardinal directions, skimming across the frozen, 
barren ground.  Where they meet emerges the statue of an old, wizened, and 
withered man.  With one knee up and the other leg dangling, the man sits on 
the jagged rock which serves as the statue's socle.  One gnarled hand fists 
in the folds of his ermine mantle, gathering it around his hunched shoulder. 
 The other arm is extended slightly, forearm resting on the propped-up knee; 
the bony fingers securely hold a pear-cut topaz.  Waves upon waves of cold 
air radiate from the statue.  Almost directly north and creeping northwest, 
the Forbidden Forest adds its gloomy, cold shadow to this eternal, magical 
winter.  A bone-gripping dampness permeates the air from the nearby Hogwarts 
Lake , stretching from up north down to the southern silhouette of the 
castle.

    <desc>Rulgard is working here. 
</desc>
    <editdraft>.  This beech tree glistens with fresh wood, and the leaves are intriguingly 
magnificent.  Different sorts of animals can be heard from the treetop, 
singing their songs of beauty, unaware that the very tree that they live in 
now will soon be made into a wand.  To the north will lead to a Winter 
Statue, and the eastside is near the Forbidden Forest.  The road that leads 
south will take one to a colourful stretch of grass, while going westward 
will take one to some noxious weeds.  In a northeast direction is the 
waterside, southeast is a magnificent mushroom patch, and a clump of bushes 
fill the northwest area.

    <editdraftcomments>I took out your 2nd sentence, michael, as it is more appropriate for an echo 
in my opinion, so here it is, please add it in: Dew drips from the tree, 
damping the ground below.  :) it's just too pretty to leave out completely.  
Again, no major changes, just fixing up your exit sentences :) 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>I did edit your ed, just had a question over your word 'scartches', I'm 
guessing you meant scratched?  :) take care!  `-mira

    <desc>The ground is covered in tall, lush, lavender herb with unusually large and 
thick blades.  Among this eldritch herb, tufts of an even stranger weed 
border little paths to the west, northwest, north, northeast, east, 
southeast, and south.  These tufts are a lurid orange, that clashes horribly 
with the pale purple around it.  This time, the blades are thin, hard, and 
sharp, like needles ready to sting the innocent passers-by.  To the 
southwest, Hogwarts Castle stands supremely unconcerned, towering above the 
odd plants and colours.

    <desc>Wet, moist soil, covered in pebbles and shells, is found in this area.  The 
place is clean and free of pollution.  Ripples of water flow towards the 
edge of the lake.  Tall, leaning trees stand nearby; their reflection is 
formed in the crystal clear water.  One can't distinguish between the real 
image and the replica.  In day-time the blue skies bring a heavenly feeling 
to the atmosphere.  During sunset, it looks like a huge, golden ball of fire 
has been drowned in a silver bowl, while the surface is calm and still.  
Aquatic insects, crabs, water-snakes are often seen in this place.  This 
waterside extends to the north and southeast.  The lake is to the east and 
northeast, while vast grounds are to the south, west, southwest and 
northwest.

    <desc>A blue-grey mist swirls about the ground, veiling it in its thick, ethereal 
coils.  Under the feet, the earth feels spongy and littered with ragged, 
slippery rocks.  Trees spring from under the mist in black, gnarled trunks; 
they block the south and most of the west vistas.  The north, northwest, 
northeast and east ways are left open.  Even on the sunniest summer day, a 
penetrating dampness raises goosebumps on all that venture in this corner of 
the ground - or it is the ominous darkness lingering here, in the shadow of 
the Forbidden Forest.

    <desc>A little, round, three-foot wide spot has been cleared in the southern part 
of this ground, right next to the Forbidden Forest.  From there radiated 
five paths to the north, northeast, northwest, west, east.  Each of the 
delimited patches grows a different kind of edible mushrooms: starting in 
north-northeast patch and going clockwise, are beige agarics, honeycombed 
morels, brown-caped boletuses, funnel-like chanterelles, and white 
puffballs.  The last patch appears empty, but a little digging would unearth 
truffles.

place of endless worlds.  Overhead, the pathless, infinite sky stretches 
indefinitely.  A few withered leaves are scattered on the wet soil.  If the 
sky is clear on the full moon, it reflects into the waters like a mass of 
darkness interrupted by a single, smiling, white snowball.  To the west is a 
small bench carved out of a large rock.  This lakeside continues south and 
northwest.  A beautiful lake with crystal-clear water lies to the north, 
east, northeast, and southeast, while dusty grounds roll open to the west 
and southwest.

The soil is loose, looking sagged and hollow.  Every chill from the wind

northeast, and south.  Strange, milky wisps of fog drift through the heavy, 
damp air.  The ground is covered with coloured mushrooms, all of them 
poisonous; a translucent barrier stands around the mushrooms, preventing 
unwary hands from harvesting them.

    <desc>At day-break, the darkness of night uncovers to reveal this beautiful piece 
of land.  Pure, clean water swims towards the shore.  Multi-coloured 
crystals cover this area.  Magical sand shines like jewels on the lake bed.  
The deeply-leaning trees provide shade and fan fresh air to passers-by.  The 
waterside stretches widely to the north and southeast.  The rare beauty of 
the lake sparkles east and northeast, while open grounds stretch to the 
south, west, southwest, and northwest.

    <desc>Heavenly skies that look as though weaved together stretch over this 
beautiful piece of earth.  The foam of the waves hits the land, washing the 
shore.  Conches and shells lie hidden in the huge pile of fine sand covering 
the land.  The water of the lake seems emerald green as nearby trees are 
reflected in it.  The air is laden with the smell of fresh water, as though 
the scent has been sprayed through the atmosphere.  This lakeside continues 
south and west.  A breathtaking, colourful stretch of grass lies southwest, 
whilst the lake extends north, east, northeast, southeast, and northwest.

    <desc>To the south of this patch stand the tall walls of Hogwarts, while the 
northwest border is overshadowed by the brooding presence of the Forbidden 
Forest.  A lone tree stands a foot apart from it.  From its hundred-foot 
tall trunk radiate five paths, winding their ways through the other, 
smaller, six-foot tall tea trees to the west, northwest, north, northeast, 
and east.  Because of the tea trees growing, days in this patch are always 
stuffy whereas the nights are chilly.

    <desc>Lapping and gnawing, never-tiring waves hit this beautiful shore.  Fine sand 
lies all over this patch of land.  Any sunlight makes the beach shine like 
liquid gold, while the surrounding pebbles refocus the luminous rays like 
clear, diamond mirrors.  A few wild bushes grow to the sides; some are 
flowering, while others have only pointed, sharp, olive-green thorns.  The 
large, shapeless shadows of the tall trees provide shade whenever the sun 
decides to cast its hot spell.  To the north, two large, heavy rocks are 
etched into the earth, large and smooth enough for even a tall man to sit on 
and admire the beauty of nature.  This damp pathway stretches east, 
southeast, and northwest.  A lake with pure, crystal-clear water is to the 
north and northeast.  A well-maintained citrus grove mushrooms to the 
southwest, while wide-open grounds reach out south and west.

    <desc>This grove, despite the Forbidden Forest ominously blocking its northwest 
border, is very agreeable.  Hogwarts stands guard to the southwest.  Citrus 
trees, standing fifteen to eighteen feet tall, offer protection from the 
weather, be it rainy or sunny.  A thick canopy of evergreen, long leaves, 
yellow-pink grapefruits, plump oranges, oval-shaped lemons, and smaller, 
green limes, grows at a constant temperature of twenty-five degrees Celsius. 
 Little tree-free dirt paths make ways to the west, northwest, north, 
northeast, east, and southeast.

    <copyright>Copyright © 2006  Carole Vaudry &lt;Vaudry2@hotmail.com&gt;</copyright>
    <desc>This patch of land is covered by silky, velvety, fine sand, the kind that 
Muggle children use to make castles.  During clear, full-moon nights, the 
dark horizon seems to cradle the pearl-white ball.  The water in the lake 
shines like flawless diamonds and the retreating waves sway ever lower until 
they die at the point where they kiss the heavens.  A few plants with wild, 
bright, colourful flowers stretch alongside the waterside.  The place is 
covered in footmarks that stand proof of the many passers-by.  This path 
continues north and northwest.  A beautiful lake looking like a pretty 
damsel with ripples of waves that look like long tresses of hair, lies east 
and northeast.  Dusty grounds stretch infinitely southwards.  A bright and 
colourful stretch of grass is to the west.  To the southeast lie tall 
cliffs, while a big apple orchard lies southwest.

    <desc>This apple orchard is obviously full of magic, though the presence of 
Hogwarts Castle to its west and south is a huge clue to any heedless 
wanderer.  Every few minutes trees pop up from great, round holes in the 
grounds, while others retreat back under the earth.  The trees are 
full-grown apple-trees, bearing large branches, vivid-green leaves, and 
yellow, green, and red apples.  Between the holes, paths lead out of this 
orchard to the north-west, north, northeast, east, and southeast.

    <desc>Green moss covers the flaking brown bark of the decaying logs.  Sharp broken 
trunks erect three feet high where the tops have snapped.  The break was 
most likely caused by last winter's heavy snowfall.  Thin broken limbs lay 
serenely in horizontal lines, while their thicker counterparts stick firmly 
into the soft earth.  The jumbled mass looks like a giant-sized game of 
Pickup Sticks.  Large enough to make a clearing of its own, the clump of 
logs provide a miniature habitat for small animals and insects.  Seedlings 
sprout around their decaying elders, hoping to become full-fledged trees in 
years to come.  Eight exits surround the crumbling logs to the north, south, 
east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.

    <editdraftcomments>Allison!  This room is so wonderful!  I love your comparison to Pickup 
Sticks, hehe.  Very cute :) I just did 3 changes I think, a comma, and 1 
word change (needs to be present tense).  Keep writing your lovely style!  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Echoes:
 
Your echoes are just perfect! Well done!
 
EDs:
 
1. I have tweaked all your three eds. Please note that you have the text of the second ed twice, one after the other.

    <editsecond>Green moss covers the flaking, brown bark of some decaying logs here.  
Sharp, broken trunks rise three feet high, ending in snapped tops.  The 
breaks were most likely caused by a recent, heavy snowfall.  Thin, broken 
limbs serenely lie in horizontal lines, while their thicker counterparts 
stick firmly into the soft earth.  The jumbled mass looks like a giant-sized

    <editsecondcomments>Lovely, lovely room here, dear Allison! As ever, I love the way you make the atmosphere of the rooms seem so beautiful and so rich. I have only two more important points:
 
1. Please mention the exits of a room. It is essential that players see the exits of the rooms they are in, so they know where to go.
 
2. Gramatically: please add commas between adjectives. For instance: 'sharp, broken trunks' instead of 'sharp broken trunks'.

sharp, tree fragments proved deadly to a squirrel who was unfortunate enough 
to lose its balance and be skewered; its body is joined by tiny skeletons of 
others who met a similar fate.

    <editdraft>.  A breathtaking view inhabits this area.  In every direction are turned 
over stones and boulders, which look as though they aren't there naturally.  
The rocks have cuts in them, as though altered by magic or some unnatural 
force.  The rocks seem to be arranged in a peculiar pattern; two small 
rocks, three big rocks, four medium sized rocks, it goes on for a long ways, 
and never seems to stop.  On the north side is a gloomy clearing, eastward 
are some fallen trees, and towards the south is a Compost Pile.  In a 
westward direction are some rocky outcrops, while in the directions of 
northwest and northeast is the forest.  A vast view of the High Priestess 
fills the southeast, and the path between greenhouses lies towards the 
southwest.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Ooh, great room :) I really like the rock pattern you made up here, very 
pretty :) 1 comment.  You had &quot;Composte&quot;.  It should be compost or 
composted, I'll let you pick which you want.

    <desc>A vast, gnarled willow tree dominates the skyline; its heavy, knobby 
branches and long, flexible shoots are perfectly still, frozen in place 
without regard to the wind.  A few, wiry shrubs grow around the tree's 
roots, taking shelter in the contorted arches.  Tough, wiry turf extends out 
from the trunk in a rough circle, twenty feet in diameter.  Just outside 
this patch of scrubby grass is an irregular ring of broken ground; loam, 
rocks, and partially-decomposed leaves lie in a freshly-turned jumble.  An 
exposed, granite outcropping, just outside the churned earth, is peppered 
with dark lumps.  The massive trunk of the willow, warped and bent, shifts 
its weight minutely, as if searching for a comfortable position.  Away from 
the gargantuan tree, the grounds spread out in all directions.

      <desc>This ancient willow forks heavily, presenting a dozen weighty limbs to the 
sky, the ends swollen in knobby balls, like angry fists.  Smaller branches 
thrust out at acute angles.  Cascading from each terminus and joint are 
green, whippy shoots, each tagged with dozens of blade-shaped leaves.  The 
tree shifts and creaks periodically, its motion unrelated to the winds that 
sweep the grounds.  An air of churning strength, barely contained, suffuses 
the area.  There is a heavy tension in the endless, discontented whispering 
of the restive leaves.

      <desc>The scarred limbs of this massive tree are clothed in smoother bark than the 
trunk; pale blotches are spattered over the smoky, taupe surfaces.  Where 
the limbs fork or end, the pebbly bark gives way to a swollen nodule, 
covered in flaking bark and decaying leaves.  From these lumps, bristling up 
through what looks like damp tea-leaves, are the flexible, arched whips that 
bear the leaves.  These slim branches are a jaundiced tan, contrasting with 
the smoky olive leaves and their straw-pale undersides.

peak and swirl, like ocean waves solidified in a storm, speckled with green, 
lichen foam.  The continuous bending and shifting of the trunk ripples the

the surface, like rocks thrusting up through the waves.  One, ragged knot is 
particularly prominent, surrounded by a whirlpool of silvery bark.

from the tidy, regular furrows left by a plowman, these random ruts and

energetic bout of Bludger testing.  Palm-sized tufts of uprooted grass and 
smaller chunks of moss are scattered around the disturbed earth for a dozen 
yards in every direction.

    <editdraft>The ground here is surprisingly soft, and it wouldn't be a surprise to sink 
in the ground a bit with each step. The leaves of the Whomping Willow litter 
the ground here, falsely creating a surprisingly brilliant landform. 
Although as one steps on this terrain, the misguidance below the leaves is 
revealed. To the north, northeast, and northwest is the beautiful forest. On 
the eastside is the Whomping Willow, in a southern direction would be some 
seedling trees, westward is a flat rock, some scrubby turfgrass fills the 
area to the southeast, and to the southwest can lead one to in front of the 
Gamekeeper's hut.

    <desc>A slightly-canted, oblong slab of rippled rock is lodged in the rich soil 
here.  With a fairly flat surface the size of a double bed, the stone shows 
signs of long use as a seat and work surface.  Near the south edge is a 
smooth section where the undulations are worn to a uniform curve in the 
shape of a seat.  Long, plumed weeds ring the rock, green in summer, dry and 
brown through the colder months.  Tufts of moor grasses spread out in all 
directions; each wiry stem is the same, faded brown all year-round.  The 
corner of the groundskeeper's hut blocks passage to the southwest.  To the 
north, the dark fringes of the Forbidden Forest stand ominously.  In the 
eastern distance, a massive willow tree stretches up against the sky; 
farther to the southwest towers the massive form of Hogwarts Castle.

    <desc>A paradise of freshness cradles this wide drive on both sides.  The healthy 
blades of grass are dotted with bright-coloured flowers in the warmer 
seasons and covered in a dazzlingly-white blanket during winter.  Polished, 
tall, black lampposts mark the way every few feet, glass boxes hanging down 
their bowed heads.  Within the containers, vivid flames exude light ranging 
from the most innocent pink to gentle cerulean blue.  The path is worn down 
by time, but clean and welcoming, the occasional traces of a footprint 
embedded in its structure.  Shiny pebbles are aligned against the smooth, 
stone bed, their surfaces polished and luminous.  Towards the east, the path 
leads towards the high doors of the steadfast Hogwarts Castle.  Against the 
horizon, at the western end of the drive, the black gates to the grounds are 
barely visible.  In all other directions stretches a splendid, large park.

    <desc>A wide stone path stretches between the eastern, large doors of Hogwarts 
Castle and a pair of stern, iron gates to the west.  White pebbles are set 
against the smooth road, their polished surfaces generously reflecting any 
hint of light into bright shimmers of angelic grace.  The air is filled with 
the heavy, thick scent of roses, glazed with sweet, gentle vanilla.  
Temperamental flowers, embracing each other's stems as though afraid to let 
go, arise in season on both sides of the road, their petals soft and a rich, 
crimson colour.  Shading them at every few feet are lampposts of a coppery 
hue.  The paint is thick, matte, and viscous, as though dripping the metal 
itself.  From the edges of the sweeping drive spread endlessly-stretching 
grounds.  Far to the south rises the exuberant silhouette of the beige walls 
surrounding the Quidditch Pitch.  Against the northern horizon emerge the 
tormented, contorted, sombre tentacles of the Forbidden Forest.

      <desc>Intricate models with oriental and Byzantine elements are carved into the 
wide base of these ten-feet-high poles.  The endless spirals are as thin as 
though traced by the tip of a feather.  Hanging from the end of the 
lampposts like bowed, tired heads are glass containers.  Behind the glass, a 
flame shivers and dances in an explosion of life and strong emotion, turning 
from pink to scarlet, to crimson, to purple, and blue in breathtaking 
moments.  Crayoned against the surrounding grounds, the shadow of these 
posts appears to vibrate slightly, as though pulsating in the wild rhythm of 
a heartbeat.  The metal is, however, still and lifeless to the touch.

    <desc>Black lampposts, their heads bowed in patient meditation, stand every few 
feet along this stone drive, like unmoving, everlasting watchers.  Their 
gentle, unwavering glow falls splendidly on complicated patterns of 
polished, white pebbles, reflecting in millions of tiny halos.  The air is 
full of the sweet, heavy scent of roses and willows, accompanied by only a 
tiny hint of vanilla.  Old, tired, but steadfast, the path runs from a pair 
of western, iron gates to a flight of eastern stairs leading to the doors of 
Hogwarts Castle.  The stone bed of the road beneath the pebbles is cracked 
and eroded in places, the occasional footprint embedded in it.  A carpet of 
grass, streaked in season with the vivid colours of many flowers, leads 
south towards the magnificent Quidditch Pitch.  Beyond a vegetable path to 
the north rises the shadow of the Forbidden Forest, its tentacles weaved 
like sinister threads into an unsuspecting, pure canvas.

    <desc>. Several, sturdy branches fill the forty-foot distance between the few trees 
which grow along the southern end of this path.  Their branches linger over 
the pathway, presenting themselves for judgement, children seeking parental 
affection.  Many layers of small rocks have been scattered over the ground, 
their pure whiteness glints intrinsically, even at night.  Several, black 
poles stand along the northern side of the walkway, each has, in its 
possession, a glass box from which a ball of white fire burns.  The edges of 
the mini-sun show off as they change from a baby-blue to a light-pink, 
touching each colour in between.  The road reaches west, to the Hogwarts 
Gates, its fingers barely grazing the wrought-iron bars.  To the east, the 
path winds and twists, anxious in its anticipation of a promised treat.  The 
lush, fascinating grounds extend in all directions, and the tip of the 
Quidditch Pitch is visible to the south, a quaint reminder of friendship.

    <desc>. Inch-long, white rocks cover the ground of this sweeping drive, making it 
appear as though hundreds of tiny clouds settled here.  Though the many 
imprints of carriages and teenage footsteps litter the exquisite walkway, 
the rocks are as pure white as a unicorn.  To the south, an array of 
magnificent oak trees line the road.  In the thirty-feet of space seperating 
each tree, thin, rod-like sticks have grown out of the ground.  Metallic and 
shiny, as though recently purchased, several copper posts stand directly 
opposite the trees.  From the top of each post is a large hoop which holds a 
glass box.  A ball of fire floats in the centre of the case, emitting a 
fierce, white light.  The path moves west to the Hogwarts Gates, and 
continues east to the castle.  The grounds are visible in all directions, 
stretching out over the vast, open space so that the Quidditch Pitch is 
barely visible in the south.

      <desc>Gigantic, strong oak trees line the southern side of this path.  Their 
branches extend high and wide in all directions, reaching blindly for some 
form of life.  Enormous extentions of their protective bodies reach out over 
the trail, shading it as a mother would a young child.  Several, abandoned 
birds' nests lie in the top-most branches, adding to the plants' look of 
helplessness.

growing randomly from the fertile ground.  At the very top of each stick is 
a sparkling, crackling explosion of colour and light.  A materialistic 
representation of excitement, these plants are like miniature, ever-lasting 
fireworks.

    <desc>. Along the southern side of this path, elegant, ancient oaks stretch upward, 
their branches reaching for the sky as though it were some type of escape.  
Luscious, green grass shimmers under the trees, sparkling beautifully, like 
it were coated in a dazzling, astrological glitter.  A layer of white rocks 
gracefully shields the ground from view.  A series of black poles, separated 
by ten feet on either side, each play host to a single, glass box, inside 
which is a ball of dimly-lit fire.  Thick, green vines modestly wrap 
themselves around the base of the poles, as though to spare them the intense 
judgement of prying eyes.  The well-kept grounds reach out in every 
direction, allowing the Quidditch Pitch to be visible in the south.  This 
path leads east, to the castle and west to Hogwarts Gates.

      <desc>The beige colour of the Quidditch Pitch stands out against the grassy, green 
grounds.  The sandy walls of the building appear to be moving, as though 
something is crawling along the sides.  The tips of six, golden hoops are 
visible above the stadium.  Atop each of the four, house-themed entrances is 
a large, metal spire, bearing a Hogwarts flag.

    <desc>.  Giant, lumbering trees litter the southern lining of this path. Enchanted 
flowers, blooming in the space between the trees, modestly release a vanilla 
scent into the surrounding area. The ground is covered in decorative, white 
rocks and laden with the dents and footprints of the many passers-by. Every 
ten feet along the north side of the walkway, copper poles hold glass boxes 
from which a dim, white light radiates. Exactly twenty-feet wide, the path 
supplies enough room for even the largest carriage to pass through. To the 
south-east the Quidditch Pitch is visible in the distance. Stretching to 
their fullest height, the trees shade most of the sky from view. The lush, 
green grounds extend in all directions, whilst this path leads west to the 
Hogwarts gate and east to the castle.

      <desc>A copper pole, six feet in height, stands here. As is the case with its 
neighbours, a large ring is attached to the very top and from it dangles a 
single, glass box. Inside the box a fire levitates, glowing dimly, and emits 
a white light. The edges of the ball of flame are hazy, and slowly change 
from a light blue to a faded pink and back again. On the base of the pole a 
tiny heart has been etched into the metal. The heart grows bigger and then 
smaller in rhythm, as though it were beating.

    <desc>. Huge, oak trees line the southern side of this path, as their branches hang 
over the walkway like protective mothers.  A layer of white rocks covers the 
ground and is smudged with the many footprints of students, teachers, and 
visitors of Hogwarts.  The north side of the road is skirted with black, 
iron poles that stand, isolated, every ten feet.  From the poles hangs a 
large, glass box, inside which floats a single ball of dim fire.  The 
grounds extend into the northern, north-eastern, north-western, 
south-western, and southern distances.  To the west are the gates and a path 
leading to Hogsmeade.  The Quidditch Pitch is visible in the far-off, 
south-eastern distance.  This path continues east, to Hogwarts.

      <desc>. The trees lining the path have grown to their massive height out of pure 
loneliness.  Twenty-foot distances separate their trunks and each enormous, 
outstretched branch touches its neighbour's, as though they were wrapping 
their arms around each other in a comforting hug.  Several, empathetic birds 
made their nests among the sadden beings and their abandoned shelters add to 
the dreary look of these omniscient plants.

    <desc>An austere assembly of black, wrought iron bars, the gates at the end of the 
path are the only entrance between Hogsmeade village to the west and the 
dominant outline of the castle to the east.  From north to south runs a 
fence made in the same fashion, a clear boundary between the two 
communities.  Its top is spiked and somewhat rusty, and the prongs are meant 
as a deterrence to those who value their own well-being.  To the east, the 
dirt road fades to a ribbon of well-treaded grass, where countless students 
have stepped on their way to and from Hogwarts.

    <desc>Perched on a strip of land between the high wall of Hogwarts Castle, to the 
west, and a sharp drop-off, to the east, this lonely path leads south and 
northeast.  The abrasive, unfinished, stone blocks of the castle wall offer 
little shelter from the buffeting winds.  Stinging grit is carried up from 
the crumbling rock of the cliff face by erratic gusts that scour the path 
and anything on it.  A tiny, green plant clings precariously to the brink of 
the drop.

perplexing as it is, the grass, unlike ordinary Muggle grass, is not 
seasonally effected, therefore the weather has a great influence on it's

enchanting scent emitted from most of the grasses on the grounds. There are

    <desc>This narrow trail leads north and south, wedged up against the towering bulk 
of Hogwarts Castle.  Nothing but the uneven, grey stone of the wall is 
visible to the west.  The east side of the pathway brushes along the edge of 
a sheer escarpment that extends far down, to the murky waters of the lake 
below.  The muddy-brown rock of the cliff face has been etched by the 
scouring winds.  The creviced stone breaks up at a touch.  In one place, a 
deep crack invades the path itself.

untouched, the crumbly brown walls of the crevice widening to provide a 
clear view of the lapping ripples far below.

wind off the lake.  The trail runs north and south, paralleling the mossy, 
stone wall of Hogwarts Castle, which stands to the west.  To the east, a

the lake, far below.  The earthy scent of wet rock pervades everything.

across the lake.  The mossy wall of Hogwarts Castle, looming just west of 
this path, is little protection from the cold.  Squeezed between the castle 
wall and the edge of a steep drop to the rippling lake, the path stretches 
north and south.  The crevice-riddled ledge is of the same, crumbling, brown 
stone as the cliff face below: cracked, uneven, and spotted with damp, 
grey-green lichen.

    <desc>This rough path perches atop a sheer cliff, huddled westward against the 
high, stone wall of Hogwarts Castle.  The rock face that stands below the 
cliff edge, to the east, is little more than an uneven surface, formed of 
crumbled stone, held together with mud, lichen, and luck.  The wind-rippled 
surface of the lake below conceals anything that might lurk beneath the 
water.  The windswept trail to the north and southeast is slightly more 
promising, though the slick, cracked surface is treacherous in its own 
right.

    <desc>The path, running northwest and south, clings to a narrow strip of ground 
between the high wall of Hogwarts Castle to the west and, to the east, a 
long drop to the lake below.  A gigantic puzzle of cracked, brown stones 
make up the irregular rock face that stretches down from the path to the 
shifting surface of the water.  Every sheltered crevice is liberally coated 
with green, slimy algae.  The treacherously-slippery plant life has begun to

    <desc>This path, stretching north and southwest, is little but a strip of bare, 
cracked rock, squeezed between Hogwarts Castle, to the west, and a 
precipitous drop to the rippling waters of the dark lake to the east.  The 
wind growls across the disintegrating stone of the cliff face, carrying the 
perpetually-wintry chill of the water far below.  The odour of damp earth 
blends with that of wet rock, with a whiff of scorched stone from the castle 
added when the wind shifts.  Thin patches of green, growing matter break up 
the uniform, dirty brown of the sheer rock extending down to the water.

    <editdraft>Nature is so extreme in this area, one would think that it is part of the 
forest. Several different trees inhabit this area, not native to London at 
all. The view here is magnificent as well as misleading, ivy can be found 
encircling the trees, though they don't look all too friendly. The leaves 
that fill this area are not like any that are found at Hogwarts at all! They 
seem magical, and yet, they seem ordinary at the same time. There are no 
visible exits! Beware! 
</editdraft>
    <extradesc>
      <desc>Cedar and Oak trees are the main forms of nature here. The cedar trees 
contain various holes in the middle, inhabited by oddly shaped squirrels. 
The oak trees seem ideal  to sit under and enjoy a good book, their massive 
tops cast a gargantuan shadow over the landscape.

    <desc>A rough footpath huddles against the comforting, grey solidity of Hogwarts 
Castle.  One can follow the trail south, southeast, or northeast.  To the 
east, the narrow rim of land ends abruptly, a crevice-riddled, vertical wall 
of rock stretching down to the quiet surface of the lake.  Stuffed behind an 
outcropping halfway down the cliff is a bundle of twigs and feathers, barely 
visible through the outcroppings of the cliff.

    <desc>An old-fashioned lamppost leans against the castle wall.  It is intricately 
wrought out of a highly shiny, mercury-like, but solid metal.  Fifteen feet 
up in the air, the top contorts into Art Nouveau, flowing shapes and 
volutes, from which dangles an equally exquisitely-forged lamp.  Between the 
metal structure of the lamp, glass panels are set.  Behind them, a light 
pulses and moves as if alive; with each throb, it changes colour and 
illuminates the five paths out, to the east, southeast, south, southwest, 
and west.

    <desc>The soft ground has been deeply excavated, especially in its northeast part. 
 There, an exposed, whitish, and rounded corner of Hogwarts's castle springs 
up from deep in the upturned soil, like a tooth of stained ivory in a black, 
wicked gum.  Jagged bits of stone, the same colour as the castle's wall, 
delimit three paths in a triskele pattern, to the north, southwest and 
southeast.  Another path, delimited with the same stones, goes straight from 
the west to the east, through the triskele's center.  A last path of wide 
stepstones, still of the same whitish colour, winds its crooked way from the 
center of the triskele to the northwest.

    <desc>This place is protected by Hogwarts castle to the north and east, and is 
close enough to the lake to have an irrigation system.  Thus, it has been 
judged the best place to grow a tropical Palm Grove.  Here, all sorts of 
tropical, edible plants are protected by a translucent quarter-dome, 
starting right from the castle wall.  Kiwi vines, heavy with fruit, cover 
the old, granite surface.  Mango and coconut trees create a vegetal, living 
maze around; however, little pineapple-delimited paths offer ways out of 
this labyrinth to the south, southwest, and west.

    <name>* A Gargoyle Statue</name>
    <copyright>Copyright © 2006  Carole Vaudry &lt;Vaudry2@hotmail.com&gt;</copyright>
    <desc>The granite outer wall of Hogwarts is here covered in a fine layer of 
obsidian, up to seven feet along its surface.  An amazing, gothic, obsidian 
gargoyle statue protrudes out of the obsidian layer, its strong wings 
spanning over three-feet on each side.  Its sharp, pleasant features are 
crowned with a mane of unruly, curly hair; its eyes are incrusted with blue 
sapphires.  Its body is finely carved, showing off bulging, black muscles, 
only covered by a loincloth.  Its firm arms are up and slightly bent so that 
they define a round space.  The statue stands upon a round pedestal, 
occupying the half closest to the wall so that a normal-sized creature has 
room to step up between its arms.  Five paths, from the east, southeast, 
south, southwest, and west, lead up to the socle.

    <desc>In the northwestern corner springs a vast stone quadrant.  A sage-scented, 
thick, white mist covers the entire bowl and occasionally boils over to the 
ground.  The gentle and soothing gurgle of running water can be heard, 
though no water is visible underneath the mist.  Where the Hogwarts walls 
meet a small sphere exudes at all times a light of the most luminous and 
calming cerulean blue, which suffuses the surrounding mist.  Small, stone 
benches are set along the three paths, to the south, southeast, and east.  
The meditative atmosphere here favours a quiet study.

    <desc>This patch of rocky ground is nestled near a indentation of the southeastern 
wall of the Hogwarts Castle; to the west, the area is bordered by the 
building.  To the west, cliffs overlook the Hogwarts Lake and taper down 
into southern watersides; to the north, they go on into a narrow, dangerous 
path, stuck between the body of water and the tall, unyielding, stone 
structure.  It is probably because of the proximity of those steep ridges 
that this area is so rocky.  However, some intense heat seems to have 
scorched it down into a glassy, black substance.  Only stubborn, but meagre, 
tufts of blackened grass manage to crack their way out of this 
incredibly-hard obsidian.  A cross-armed statue is leaning casually against 
the centre of the western wall, apparently made out of the same matter.  
From its feet, five paths lead out to the north, northeast, east, southeast, 
and south.

    <editdraftcomments>Oooh obsidian!  I learned about this over the summer in my geo class!  
Obsidian is volcanic glass, and it's under the felsic group, even though 
felsic is supposed to be for light colored rocks (like white, pink, etc.)  
And that's all I remember, but yay for obsidian!  :D just a few tweaks here 
as normal, carole.  You did very well!  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>For your echo #0, pleae make caught catches, as we always write in present 
tense here, please!  :) and #1 should be 'off', not of.  And lastly, I've 
edited your statue ed.  Take care, lovely girl!  `-mira

      <desc>The scabbard is thin, long, and slightly curved at the tip: it probably 
holds a light-weight sabre, rather than a heavy sword.  A small depiction of 
a pitchfork-wielding, forked-tailed, horned demon is carved on it.  Below 
that, is a smooth rectangle, just barely outlined; inside of the figure, are 
engraved the letters &quot;XV&quot;.

      <desc>The statue is otherworldly, androgynously handsome.  Two other peculiarities 
indicate that this may not represent a human being: two small horns poke out 
of the sleek, shoulder-length hair, and a cruel, sensual smirk uncover two 
long, sharp canines .  The face looks virile with its square jaw, firmly 
defined cheekbones, and its straight nose, but more womanly features 
softened the ensemble: full lips, almond-shaped eyes, and a smooth skin.  
The eyebrows mix masculine and feminine traits: they are thick, but also 
perfectly drawn, as if pencilled in.  Likewise, the body balance the two 
sexes' characteristics.  Clad in a sleeveless, v-necked, ankle-length robe, 
the creature has a flat chest, and yet the waist tapers and then flare into 
a very curvy bosom under a large, cloth belt; from the latter hangs a 
scabbard.  The muscles are barely, gracefully chiselled.  The neck, wrists, 
and ankles are slender and delicate, yet strong.  Mid-thigh high, 
stiletto-heeled boots are visible under the robe's waist-high slits.

    <desc>From the Hogwarts Castle's western wall extends a delicate, stone canopy in 
the resemblance of heavy, silvery drapes.  Under it, in a honey, wicker 
throne with a high, rounded back, sits a life-sized china doll.  She is 
looking east, towards the lake, while the scent of flowers drifts in from 
the southern flower beds.  To the north, a niche into the castle's wall is 
visible.  In the doll's lap lie unwrapped sweets and empty wrappers.  More 
wrappers litter the five paths to the north, northeast, east, southeast, and 
south, and the patches of shrubs between the paths.  The shrubs produce 
berries of the edible kind: strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, 
cranberries, blackcurrants, and blueberries.

      <desc>(to be made into an object) The statue is as chubby as a candy.  A 
large-brimmed, red, velvet hat tries to discipline her unruly, 
strawberry-blonde curls; a few loose strands fall, however, over her 
expressive, ice-green eyes.  Her love-apple-like cheeks and cherry lips 
contrast sweetly with her pale, rosy complexion, as does the rich, deep-red 
velvet of her dress.

      <desc>Regardless of season, the berries are always just ripe, sweet, and juicy.  
Also, no matter how many have just been picked up, their number never seems 
to diminish.  However, the shrubs defend them fiercely with thorns and 
irritable leaves; their branches are inextricably entwined, making it 
difficult to reach the berries in their thick.  Sometimes, a wayward branch 
creeps into one of the paths.

Candy, That'll keep her happy&quot;.

    <desc>Due to the proximity of the lake, the ground is a mess of black mud.  
Dainty, polished 'Art Nouveau' motifs lace the grey stone of the seven 
bridges radiating away from this spot.  The bridges start from the grounds 
north, northeast, southwest, and west, from the waterside east and south, 
and from the lake southeast.  A central platform, placed high in the air, 
serves as their meeting point.  These refined, pale bridges contrast vividly 
with the black soil.

    <desc>Shiny alliums flourish in a vivid shade of purple flourish in this patch of 
grounds.  The purple colour of these flowers is enchanting.  Tiny flowers 
make up bunches, making the plants look like bouquet.  When looked upon from 
a distance, this land looks like an ocean of blue, green, and magenta.  The 
soil in this area is well-drained and fertile; the blooms prefer to stretch 
like royal lions, basking in any drop of sunlight they can get.  With a 
height of about three feet, the tiny specimens of rare beauty turn with any 
wind, graceful and fast like galloping, fiery stallions.  Their slender 
branches are flexible and smooth.  An old, stone bench stands to the north, 
waiting for its next occupant.  This beautiful flowerbed extends west.  
Seven stone bridges extend to the west.  Ceaseless, cool winds blow from the 
southeastern waterside; while dust envelopes the grounds towards the south 
and southwest.

    <desc>Highly nourished here in the fertile soils are cosmos flowers.  Their height 
ranges from two to four feet.  Situated to the north are yellow blooms, 
while red ones dominate the south.  The petals organize themselves 
gracefully; three of them are the top layer, while the remaining ones form 
the base.  In the middle are the saffron-shaded pollens.  At times, pink 
flowers bloom in between the other cosmos blossoms, like a fairy amidst of a 
mass of princes.  Their green stems are etched deep into the earth.  The 
yellow blooms shine brightly; they could be used as a substitute for gold 
were they any more solid.  The lovely flowers stretch all along, 
transforming the dullness of a patch of dry lifeless ground into a 
multicoloured paradise.  They love to stare at the sky and count the bright 
jewels of the sky on a clear night.  This pretty flowerbed spreads its magic 
to the east and west, while vast grounds open out south, southeast, and 
southwest.

    <desc>An active mass of fresh pansies blooms from the thick layer of soil here.  
Their colours range across the entire spectrum.  The streaks on the petals 
are like a rainbow etched across their softness.  Gold and orange blossoms 
are to the north, while shocking, violet flowers streaked in baby-pink are 
scattered to the south.  The pansies tend to dislike excess sunlight and 
bend their lovely heads, as though fearing the light will snatch their 
beauty.  The land is not level; a few rocks raise their heads above the 
surface of earth.  The delicate flowers all around shed their leaves and 
petals even at the slightest of breezes, thus covering the ground in a 
mosaic of all the shades imaginable, underneath this velvet carpet, a narrow 
path slithers through the garden.  This breathtaking flowerbed spreads far 
and wide east and west.  To the southwest is a small turn towards a path 
between the willows; wide grounds spread south and southeast.

    <desc>Attractive, red poppies sprout in this little corner of land.  These pretty 
flowers are considered a symbol of tragedy as well as of new life.  The 
plants are arranged at a suitable distance, so that the roots have enough 
space to grow.  The flower-heads have a typical tendency to move in the 
direction of any sunlight, and hate to be kept in a dark, shady place.  They 
bloom to their fullest extent during mid-summer.  Huge stones are kept near 
the edges, leaving narrow entrances to the garden.  To decorate the place a 
few creepers are planted to the edges, their twists and turns look graceful 
and seem to cast a mystic look upon the poppies.  A rickety, wooden bench 
stands east like an old man balancing on a walking stick.  People prefer to 
sit on the earth rather than on the bench, so it is used as a hangout for 
various birds.  The beauty of the flowerbeds spreads through east and west.  
The turnings to the south and southwest pierce through the raging winds and 
lead the way through the willows.

    <desc>A mass of golden daffodils move their heads in a sprightly dance.  Clusters 
of blossoms grow on some stems, while few bloom only one, single flower.  
Six to eight petals cling next to each other in a cup-like structure.  Their 
colour is caramel-gold, and they shine brightly.  On a dark day, they shine 
like golden pearls, illuminating the entire land.  The tender, smooth stems 
bend the flower-heads towards the earth as though shy of facing the sky.  
These innocent and beautiful blooms are the bliss of solitude.  As the birds 
sing from tree-tops, the plants seem to dance to their rhythm.  The 
ultramarine sky grins at the crowd below, and wishes to descend down to 
earth.  A few tall oak trees stand north; making home to all the small 
animals as well as birds.  A large variety of flowers are found to the east 
and northwest; flat, open grounds stretch south, west, southeast, southwest, 
and northwest.

    <desc>Bright, sparkling, marigold flowers bring a breathtaking look to this patch 
of old earth.  They grow in a racemic range of colours from saffron to 
salmon, while the shades are streaked, striped, and multicoloured.  Double 
layered petals like concentric circles cling to delicate stems.  Most of the 
plants are about six feet high, while a few are like dwarfs.  The flowers 
are cut in a way to look like different animals.  The blooms cast their 
sharp, dark shadows on the land, as though draping it in a black shawl.  To 
the north, stands a tall tree.  On the very top of it is a densely populated 
honeycomb.  The bees find their food in this land.  The aroma of the blooms 
spreads far through the place, into the woods; on moving north it combines 
with the scent of aromatic bluebells.  This lovely flowerbed crawls south, 
southeast, and southwest.

    <desc>In season, flowers grow on big bunches of purple blueweed.  They rise 
singly, or in pairs upon curled branches, on the reddish-black ground.  
Harmless weeds grow here and slyly among them are poisonous ones.  Beside 
them is a cluster of agapanthus; crisp, white flowers stand on short 
branches during autumn.  Dust envelopes the beauty of the wild blossoms.  
They magically change colour to match the sky.  This lovely flowerbed, which 
seems the veriest school of peace, extends to the east, west, and the 
southwest, while open grounds stretch in the south and the southeast.

    <desc>The perfume of jasmine flowers wafts along with the air in this patch of 
fertile, moist earth.  The atmosphere is so quiet that one can hear the 
blossoms breathe.  They are white with a tint of chrome-yellow.  The leaves 
are oval and lobed like ribbons.  The small flowers grow close to each 
other, looking like a bouquet.  On a dark night, they form a suitable 
substitute for the moon.  On a rainy day, the pitter-patter raindrops seem 
like pretty ladies resting on the soft and silky plants, they wash out the 
dust that accumulates on the leaves; the petals open out like a thirsty 
child seeking water.  The heavy scent of the blooms becomes even more 
intense as the rain lashes them; they have the power to enhance minds.  The 
simplicity of this garden adds to its beauty.  Students come to this place 
after tiring classes to relax in the midst of these delicate, refreshing 
blooms.  The beauty of this flowerbed shines further south and west, while 
puffs of dust blow southwest, leading to the grounds.

    <desc>Scattered sunflowers, like broken shards of the orb they bear the name of, 
spread on the earth of this patch.  The blossoms grow quite close to each 
other, like twin sisters with beautiful, glowing, eager faces.  The petals 
have a tawny hue, with hazel streaks.  Seeds having the colour of burnt 
umber look like a pretty necklace on the blooms.  The soil in this land is 
well-prepared and fertile; the plants grow up to three feet tall.  Their 
branches are slender and bend in a U-shape towards the top.  The flower 
heads always cast a look upwards, thirstily hoping to receive any sunlight 
from the infinitely-stretching heavens.  To the sides, large cane baskets 
containing seeds are stored.  The scent of the blossoms lingers through the 
entire place .  This lovely flowerbed continues south and west, while 
extensive grounds spread out southwest.

    <desc>Pretty bluebells rise in this smooth, fertile, and magical patch of earth.  
The plants are evergreen; growing up to four feet high, the flowers are 
shaded in sapphire and lilac.  They cling to the slender stems like church 
bells on a high tower.  The petals are curled like springs, they clutter 
next to each other like crystal lattices on the sepal.  Broad and long 
leaves surround the tiny, olive branches.  When it rains, the blossoms seem 
to open out wider, as though receiving a very precious gift; the shard-like, 
transparent raindrops, slash out the mud, whipping it.  The few dry petals 
fallen on the ground makes an excellent combination with the green leaves 
showered by tall trees on the sides.  This breathtaking flower bed continues 
north, east, and southeast, while long and distant grounds lie south, west, 
southwest, and northwest.

extending their petals to the sky, hopefully and expectantly.  They come in 
shades of white, soft pink, deep purple, and a calming blue.  They are 
planted in wonderful, fertile ground, with their roots clearly sunk in 
deeply.  Off in the south, there is one beautiful tree looming out of the 
ground, hovering over the lilies.  Its deep-green petals are reaching out 
towards the sky expectantly, just like the petals around them.  Soft, pink 
buds are shooting out of the tree, eager to be apples.  There is also one 
magical tree shooting out of the ground.  Off in the southeast and 
southwest, mother nature hurries on her way, quickly intwining many flowers 
together in a beautiful pattern.  In the north, northeast, and northwest 
there are more lilies and shrubs but they are becoming mixed with other 
flowers.

    <desc>Many colorful and beautiful lilies grow here.  They are spread all around 
you with a few other shrubs to keep them shaded.  They come in many 
different shapes, but most of them are about a eight inches high.  They come 
in shades of soft pink, dark purple, bright yellow and white.  Their 
beautiful color stands out brightly, making the shrubs seem very plain.  
They stand erect and tall, basking in the sunlight, with their leafy arms 
stretched wide open.  Off to the north, east, south, west their number 
diminishes into many other kinds of flowers and shrubs.  Off to the 
Northeast, Southeast, Southwest and Northwest, you can see mother nature 
continue her beautifully woven path of lilies.

    <desc>Wild and colourful lilies bloom in this part of land.  A few other shrubs 
are planted to their side to provide shade to the lily plantations.  The 
soil in the terrain is wet, rich and fertile; the plants grow two to three 
feet deep and like to bask in any sunlight.  A couple of buds emerge near 
the axils of the leaves.  These blossoms have an ancient beauty within 
themselves; the petals are cropped near the edges and curl like springs, and 
are as smooth as silk to the touch.  The leaves are oblong and pointed, the 
colour is a mixture of olive and jade.  As the darkness of the night befalls 
upon these pretty blooms, it seems to look like as bright as a newly 
discovered gem.  This lovely flower strewn garden continues north, south, 
and northwest while vast grounds lie west and southwest.

    <desc>In season, beautiful and delicate Dahlia flowers mushroom in this patch of 
land.  Their colours range from crimson to violet and from white to apricot. 
 The flowers are shaded deep-chrome in the middle; the pollen grains grow in 
a round shape and are a bit tall, looking like tea-cups.  About five to six 
petals grow on each flower and they are extremely delicate; the edges are 
not smooth and curl towards the white ends.  The petals, leaves, and sepals 
fall on the ground during any strong wind, as though decorating the earth in 
various designs.  The leaves are soft, silky, and oblong; they appear 
thoroughly oiled.  A few tall oaks surround the edge of this land.  A wooden 
bench about two feet high stands in the shadow of the trees; it is showered 
in leaves.  This breathtaking flowerbed continues south and west, while 
dusty grounds extend southwest, as infinite as the sky.

    <desc>A mass of aster plants grows in this place.  The plants are leafy; plenty of 
them bloom in vibrant colours of blush and deep-violet.  Borders of white on 
the pink flowers and of magenta for the lilac ones streak the edges of the 
petals.  The flowers are open, as though welcoming bees and butterflies to 
collect nectar.  The leaves are jade and oblong; a few of them are lobed.  
The bright streaks on the blossoms make an excellent combination with the 
surroundings.  On a rainy day, the heads of the plants seem to dance with 
joy, like peacocks spreading out their wings at the mere sight of dark 
clouds.  A five feet tall statue of a female house elf stands nearby.  She 
is shown pouring water on the plants, wearing an aster flower in her hair.  
This beautiful flowerbed continues east, west, and southeast, while layers 
of dust cover the grounds to the south and southwest.

    <desc>In season, plump, colourful sunflowers flourish in this patch of land and 
grow as high as twelve feet in fertile, well drained soil.  As their name 
suggests, their lovely heads turn towards the sky in the hope of being 
gifted with any sunlight.  The branches of these plants grow in all 
directions and have oval, oblong leaves; the petals are shaded in colours of 
bright-orange and deep-chrome, with streaks of burnt-sienna.  In the middle 
of each blossom is a round, green space, covered with jet-black pollen 
grains.  The flowers cluster quite close to each other, as though packed in 
a bouquet.  The oil from the seeds is used quite often, while the remains 
are used as fodder for the cows.  On a sunny day, the path basks in the 
golden light brightened by the plantations.  This lovable flowerbed 
continues east and northwest, while welcoming grounds lie south, west, 
southeast, and southwest.

    <desc>In the warmer seasons, crimson and pearly-white daisies grow in this patch 
of land.  Their petals spread out like an umbrella; they are soft to the 
touch.  The white ones are stainless, while the pink ones are dark in the 
interior, with the colour fading outwards.  The leaves are long and oblong, 
but soft-textured like satin.  A couple of deep-yellow pollen grains are 
cluttered in the middle, like bright specks upon a velvety canvas.  
Well-drained, red soil forms a base for the plantations.  The stem stands 
erect, while the flower bends towards the sky, as though expecting 
something.  Rows upon rows of blossoms, arranged like a theatre audience, 
are parted by a central, stone pathway.  This perennial flower is a symbol 
of brief happiness.  The lovely flowerbed continues north and southeast, 
whilst grounds spread out south, west, southwest, and northwest.

    <desc>In the warmer seasons, an assortment of crimson carnations is found on this 
piece of land.  Rich, well-drained soil nourishes the plants.  A few of them 
have a faint tint of snowy-white streaks on them, as though an artist had 
painted them that way.  Others have a fuchsia colour in the interior and 
shades ofpinkish-white towards the exterior; the curls in the petals make 
the flowers look like whirlpools.  The blossoms are fluffy to the touch, the 
cuddly blooms resembling soft, cotton pillows.  These carnations beam with 
pride and beauty.  The ground is covered by the multicoloured petals and 
looks like a velvet carpet.  This lovely flowerbed continues south and 
northeast, while wide open grounds stretch like the infinite sky to the 
north, west, southwest, and northwest.

    <desc>Attractive bluebells bloom in this patch of land.  Their stunning 
combinations of lavender buds and blue blooms look like bell-shaped bowed 
heads.  The petals are dark in the middle, but the colour fades as they curl 
up towards the end.  Pollen grains look like decorative beads in a girl's 
hair.  Small, rounded leaves lace the base of the slender stems, which can 
grow up to fourteen inches high, always ending in nodding, tender flowers.  
The soil in this area is well-drained and moist.  Tall trees surround the 
plantations like guards around beautiful ladies.  The beauty of this land is 
breathtaking.  This flower bed continues east and southwest.  Open grounds 
lie west.  A sweeping path to the north turns into a drive as it continues 
northeast.

    <desc>Deep-chrome, yellow western wallflowers mushroom in this patch of land.  The 
plant grows about two feet high; the stems are slender and erect, with 
plenty of leaves.  Clusters of flowers emerge on the short stalks.  The 
blossoms have four petals, shaded from lemon-yellow to the orange tinge of 
an early-morning sun.  In between the four sepals, long, white pollen grains 
grow.  The fruit is flattened, with winged seeds.  Leaves and blooms lie 
scattered on the dusty pathway.  The branches look like long thorns and open 
out in all directions.  This beautiful flowerbed stretches east and west.  
The sweeping drive north and northeast extends into a northwestern path.

    <desc>Silky, oval-shaped oriental poppies emerge in this region during the warmer 
part of the year.  Flowers in shades ranging from salmon pink to deep orange 
emerge out of fuzz-covered buds.  Most petals are ruffled, crimped, and cut. 
 The well-drained soil and any sunlight suits the plants.  To the east is a 
small, wooden bench in the shape of two hearts next to each other; it has 
the capacity to accommodate two people.  Students come here to meet their 
loved ones.  This beautiful and well kept flowerbed stretches widely to the 
east and west.  A long and wide, stone pathway descends northeast, from 
beneath the feet of Hogwarts Castle; it turns into a sweeping drive as it 
moves north and northwest.

    <desc>In season, lovely tulips in varying colours are found in this fertile and 
well-drained piece of land.  They come in every, single, rich and delicate 
colour in the rainbow.  The flowers have three inner petals; the outer 
sepals closely resemble these.  Quite a few of the tulips are striped.  
Brown and hairy tubers grow underneath the ground.  The blossoms clutter 
close to each other, like honeybees around honey.  On a bright day, the sun 
seems to cast its mysterious smile on these flowers.  This flowerbed, which 
is a rare specimen of natural beauty, elongates west.  A long, northern 
pathway leads to the enormous Hogwarts Castle, while a sweeping drive 
extends northwest.

    <desc>Amidst the rich botanic motley of the gardens, a patch of flagstone intrudes 
upon the earth.  While elegantly positioned, the original architects deeply 
underestimated the Hogwart greenery's enthusiasm for life.  Cracks ripple 
violently through the stone, giving way to leaves and blossoms of all 
description, reaching for the open air.  Every split chunk of gray has been 
consumed by a film of mucky green moss.  It is a rocky step or two north to 
the greenhouse, or northwest to step between this one and the next.  
Northeast, a wooden tunnel beckons with its torchlight glow, leading the way 
back to Hogwart grounds.  A peaceful courtyard lies to the east, and a rain 
barrel to the west.  The lush vegetable gardens span in all southern 
directions.

    <desc>Radish plants flourish in this piece of land.  The crispy roots are about 
two feet deep in the ground and taste peppery.  Simple, deeply lobed green 
leaves are above the ground while the vegetable is underground.  Their shape 
varies from round to oblong, and is in shades of red, white, pink, and 
purple.  To the east pea vines attach to any support they can find, making 
dense foliage.  Peas nurture in long and curved, green, tender pods which 
grow near the leaves.  Small white flowers having five petals form a canoe 
shape.  The garden extends to the east, south, west, and the southeast while 
wide open grounds lie to the north, northeast, southwest, and the northwest.

    <desc>Room changed from 2060 here by Cristina/Kaya. The lovely Rulgard is the author.
</desc>
    <editdraft>This room is brilliantly lit by the sun outside.  The walls, ceiling, and 
even doors are made of glass, allowing sunlight to pass through it into the 
room.  One long table spreads throughout a small section of this greenhouse, 
with sinks installed in the table every three feet or so.  Plants litter the 
greenhouse, from immature Mandrakes, to Devil's Snare; almost any plant can 
be found.  About twenty pairs of gloves lay on a small shelf in a corner, 
along with earmuffs and goggles.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>This room is very good too, michael :) I love the mention of mandrakes and 
devil's snare!  Just a few tweaks for you here.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Echoes:
 
Please change the echo to 'A ray of light strikes the outer glass of the greenhouse and explodes within, in a gleaming flood.'
 
EDS:
 
I have edited the ed of 'table'. Please remember to have a look.

    <editfirst>This room is brilliantly lit by the sun outside.  The walls, ceiling, and 
even doors are made of glass, allowing sunlight to pass through it into the 
room.  One long table spreads throughout a small section of this greenhouse, 
with sinks installed in the table every three feet or so.  Plants litter the

be found.  About twenty pairs of gloves lay on a small shelf in a corner, 
along with earmuffs and goggles.  
</editfirst>
    <editsecond>The walls, ceiling, and southern door of this room are entirely made of 
glass, allowing any light to pass through, inside.  (A steady warmth 
magically lingers everywhere, twirling around tall, dark trees and low, 
thick bushes.)  One, long table spreads across a small section of this 
greenhouse, with sinks installed into its surface at every three feet.  
(Except for a small walkway around this table, the greenhouse is covered in 
earth of different colours and textures; from within it rise various plants. 
 Round, tuber-like, wart-filled trees scowl at young, Mandrake leaves; 
violently-coloured flowers twist against tall, coiling vines.  Beneath a 
low, very thick bush stretches a symbiotic growth of apparently-soft, 
motionless, hardy roots.)  About twenty pairs of gloves lie on a small shelf 
in a corner, along with earmuffs and goggles.  (A large number '1' is carved 
at the very entrance, into a squared board hanging from the roof.)  The 
greenhouse continues through a large, glass archway, heading north.  
</editsecond>
    <editsecondcomments>1. Do not mention sunlight or sun in any form here, since we have to be able to deal with nightfall and storms, as well as general sunlight.
 
2. I added some descriptions between brackets. Please remember to give your rooms texture and substance, which would give even more feeling to your rooms. Please also do not declare the more 'interesting' plants, like Devil's Snare (who, by the way, hates sunlight, hence please remember to put it in the shade), but instead tell the readers what they look like and they can look things up for themselves.
 
3. I took the liberty of adding the number 1 there as this is Greenhouse 1.
 
4. Please remember to add exits.

    <editdraftcomments>. Scott, first and foremost, for a first room this is absolutely amazing.  I 
don't think I've editted a better first attempt!  Just a couple of small 
changes: Sentence 1, please remove &quot;the&quot; from before &quot;the years of 
abandonment&quot; as it is unnecessary.  Sentence 2, please add a comma after 
&quot;stone ground&quot;.  Otherwise, this is a fabulous room.  Keep them coming!!

experts.  One such face shows in the corner; the grin a previous herbology 
professor, Pomona Sprout, gleams proudly on the stone surface.  A long 
wooden table covered in various herbology tools and supplies lines the 
middle of the room.  The front half of greenhouse extends to the south and a 
closed door stands to the north.

    <editdraftcomments>Hey carole :) just a bit of tweakage done here for your glorious room.  Just 
on a side note, you tend to follow the same patter in your rooms.  You 
mention the wall, you mention the castle, then you state there's a statue.  
Feel free to move it around a bit, and mix it up!  It'll keep your creative 
juices flowing, and make the writing more fun and not so monotonous.  :) 
just a suggestion though.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1. Please change echo number 0 to: 'Dim shadows move restlessly within the greenhouses.'
 
2. Please change the timing of echo number 0 to daylight hours, since shadows might be hard to glimpse after nightfall.
 
3. Please change echo number 1 to: 'A shapeless blur of a silhouette dances behind the glass wall of one of the greenhouses.'
 
4. Please change the timing again to daylight hours.
 
5. You need to change echo number 2 to: 'A fiendish din resonates briefly from within the greenhouses, before all returns to silence - for now.'
 
EDS:
 
I've altered your ed a little bit and I've added a comment there. Please take a look when you get the time.
 
COMMENTS:
 
In general, the greenhouses should be spelled with a non-capital. You can capitolize the word if you use it as: 'Hogwarts Greenhouses'.

    <editsecondcomments>As a main point here, I've tweaked out all that says: better, worse, lucky, or things like that. The reason I've done so is that these adjectives depend on perspective. Think of Hagrid and how eagerly he enters the Forbidden Forest. Agreed, he's one in a billion, but for those characters, we can't say that the Forbidden Forest is good or bad; instead, we just describe it and they can think for themselves what they want to think.
 
I have rephrased your sentence two a bit, as well, partly because you have 'To make things worse' there, and partly because I feel that it is better to leave the people guessing a bit. I mean, they will see a lonely, bumpy willow, not a tag saying that this is the Whomping Willow. They can figure that out by themselves. Or get whacked, of course :D.
 
Other than that, the room was mostly perfect. I've made sure to add some stuff regarding distances. For instance, the Whomping Willow is FAR to the northwest, because you can go northwest and you still don't see it there, but one room away from there. Similarly, the castle is DISTANT.
 
Another small comment would be to take out things like 'it must be said'. Although these things are great in normal writing, in books for instance, or in stories, it loses much of its value here. This is because we try here to make dynamic rooms, which exude life and make peope feel the atmosphere real-time. Patterns in writing will remind the players that this is written, rather than real. I'm not sure if that's any clearer, but I hope you get the point.
 
Great work on this one, dear Carole; I do like the fact that you give some information about the exits, because that is such a good atmosphere-providing tool! `-Cristina

      <desc>Not a millimetre of this sculpted woman's stone skin is visible.  A piece of 
headgear covers her hair and forehead, and extends in a flap of cloth that 
shrouds the nape of her neck.  A blank, white mask conceals all of her face; 
even the eyes are hidden behind reflective lenses, directly incorporated 
into the emotionless covering.  A high-collared, toe-length robe finishes up 
the ensemble.  A cumbersome, wide sash is tied around her waist; it prevents 
the clothing from blowing up, even though the heavy material and strict cut 
would not let that happen anyway.  The waistband is held together by a 
buckle, which consists of a plain, metal rectangle, with a barely-smaller 
one etched inside; within the narrower figure, the letters &quot;II&quot; are 
engraved.  A hint of leather boots is scarcely visible at the toes.

</desc>
    <editdraft>Large clay barrels sit conveniently beneath each greenhouse gutter.  Thick 
chunks of dried mud cling to the sides of the clay surface, making the 
natural pastel orange color a dingy gray-brown; practicality winning over 
beauty.  Moss and dirt fight to engulf the glazed form of the barrel, 
leaving it a putrid green-brown swirl of color to cover the battleground.  
Catching the gutter water, the tub serves as a preservation receptacle.  
Providing the grounds with natural soft water, the water butts store the 
liquid until needed.  Not only do the barrels store water for the gardening 
by retaining the heavy rainfall, the barrels also prevent soil erosion as 
well as flooding.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Hey allison :) sorry it's taken me so long to get to your room.  My only 2 
comments are: &quot;the water butts store the liquid&quot;...  Butts?  Maybe I'm 
misunderstanding something here...  And you meet the minimum 4 sentence 
length requirement, but if you're feeling up to it, I'd love to have you 
write more and see your lovely creativity in this already great room.  No 
pressure though of course.  :) 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>For your echo, I think a comma is needed after 'water', and in your barrel 
ed you have that 'the aged water butts' again.  I think I don't know a 
second use for this term or something, lol, I feel so silly.  Keep up the 
great work though, allison!  :) `-mira

    <editdraft>Although this Flagstone entry is much like the others, it significally 
stands out more. A gigantic stone is carved into an outstanding figure, '3'. 
Although it is obvious that this stands for 'Greenhouse Three', it is also 
suspicious that the Herbology teacher is letting third years do herbology in 
the morning, while it is still cool outside. On the eastside is an 
outstanding rain barrel, to the south is a gigantic Vegetable Garden, and 
westward is a Stone Potting Bench. In a northeastern direction is the path 
between greenhouses, the grand Hogwarts Grounds fill the area to the 
southwest, and in the direction of southeast is a Vegetable Garden. To the 
northwest are some pesky weeds, and lastly to the north can be found the 
front half of Greenouse Four.

    <desc>Green foliage of spinach saplings flourish in this small piece of earth; 
they are six to nine inches high.  Red, fertile, well-drained soil covers 
the ground.  Several leaves emerge from the tender stems, their oval shape 
broadening towards the base; white flowers grow on the slender branches.  
Although they wither away like a candle blows off, the tiny blooms beautify 
the surroundings.  In the early morning, small dew-drops cover the delicate 
leaves and the branches, making them look like pieces of shining glass.  
Crimson, bright, lustrous tomatoes grow to the west.  During the daytime, 
they shine under any bit of sunlight.  Axils that emerge from the slender 
vines bear clusters of small, yellow blossoms, which later develop into the 
fruits.  They are too heavy for the weak, rough, frizzy plants, and are 
pulled towards the land by gravity, their shadow draping the moist earth 
below.  The garden extends towards the east, west, and the southeast, while 
the open, rolling grounds extend in all other directions.

    <desc>Large, blue-green, lobed leaves of broccoli grow with mushroom-like florets 
emerging between them.  The height is about twenty-four inches.  The stems 
have a similar flavour to asparagus.  The veins can be clearly seen; they go 
in different directions like a stream.  To the east, cabbages nurture in the 
fertile soil; they are in shades of jade, red, and purple.  The shapes vary 
from oval to flattened or pointed.  Smooth and thick leaves grow around each 
other in layers, most are dense while some are loosely bound.  The shade is 
deeper in the interior and fades in the exterior.  The garden extends 
towards the east, while wide open grounds stretch towards the north, south, 
west, northeast, southeast, southwest, and the northwest.

    <desc>This patch of land is particularly dusty and unkempt; people prefer to keep 
out of it.  Trees as tall as bamboo sticks stand east and west; spiders spin 
cobwebs from one tree to another, over the foliage of leaves.  Half-eaten, 
rotten fruit and dry leaves are scattered across the uneven patch.  The 
orientation of the planets can be very well observed here on clear nights.  
Grounds as long as the heavenly sky extend north, south, west, northeast, 
southeast, and northwest, while a grove lies southeast.  Fresh, juicy 
vegetables with eye-catching colours grow to the east.

    <editdraft>Scrubby turfgrass covers this rather rocky patch of land.  During the warmer 
parts of the year, this green coverlet is punctuated by a few dandelions and 
a patch of clover.  A violent rent in the grass may have been caused by the 
Whomping Willow, which stands to the north.  The upturned dirt reveals an 
abundance of gravel.  Nearby, into the distant south and southeastern 
distance, are the Greenhouses; to the east, the rocky patch extends further. 
 In all other directions are lovely, uninterrupted grounds.  
</editdraft>
    <editeds>Echo number 0 should become: 'A cricket emerges from the grass and begins a little symphony.'

We do not use second person in descs or echoes.

    <editsecondcomments>This is a good basic description; it adds texture to the title of the room.
 
However, you need to tell the players where they can go from here. In the final version, we will have no map, not even the smaller areamaps. Therefore, you need to describe or at least mention all the exits. I have suggested you a way to do so, but of course, it's your call how to do it. If you wish to rephrase this differently than I suggested, please,please go ahead, only make sure you tell me about it in a subsequent note, so I can check the new changes again.
 
A second comment: flowers and grass grow here only during the warmer seasons. Otherwise, Scotland is cold enough for snow, so everything will freeze around here. We generally add 'seasonally' or 'during the warmer seasons', or things of that effect when we mention grass and flowers.

    <editdraft>.  Young plants engulf the area.  There are enormous patches of about fifty 
to sixty plants in each row, with about a thousand rows within the area.  
Growing in the patch, seedling trees are visible, still immature.  They give 
off the scent of fresh youth, which is strangely pleasurable.  On the north 
side of this area is a Soft Turf, to the east is some scrubby turfgrass, and 
in a southern direction is some hazel thicket.  Westward leads to the path 
(in front) of the Gamekeeper's Hut, the Whomping Willow fills the area to 
the northeast, and in the direction of southeast, one will find a Holly 
bush.  To the southwest is a brilliant magician statue, and finally to the 
northwest can be found a Flat Rock.

    <desc>. Stones and pebbles lie undisturbed in the narrow pathway.  Towards the west 
of the path stands a small hut.  Straw and hay make a roof for the little 
cottage.  A black, polished, wooden door covers the entrance to the east.  A 
bronze-coloured, heavy handle hangs on the front door.  Puffs of smoke blow 
from the tall chimney.  Clean, white curtains cover the stainless, glass 
windows to prevent any outside intrusion.  Wide-open grounds elongate in all 
other directions.

    <desc>Towards the northwest of the congested room is a stone fireplace, with 
flying, golden embers sparking and flames leaping out like a snake's tongue 
after its prey.  The furniture is scarce in this room; it consists of a 
closet, table, and a bed.  There is a chest with many drawers.  A single, 
hand-woven cane basket resides here.  Satin curtains drape themselves around 
the spotless windows.  A large door to the west leads to the vegetable 
patch, whilst the pathway to the east leads to the enormous castle of 
Hogwarts.

stands in the room.  On top of the table is a box, containing 
different-coloured paper tissues.  A pearl-white tablecloth, delicately 
knitted, covers the table.  A few tea cups are kept over tea coasters.  
Placemats with designs of various fruits are arranged over the white cloth.  
Tucked under the table are three extra-large chairs.

streaks, it depicts an ancient era of civilization.  The sculptures on it 
are minute, yet quite detailed.  The hinges of the door are made out of 
strong tree barks.  The interior also magnifies the rich art of old times.  
There are three shelves; each compartment is spacious enough to keep a

the tears in the fabric, which makes it look bright and colourful.  The legs 
of the cot are heavy, strong, and polished.

of a horse, while on the other is a lion with a long mane.  A faint smell of 
perfume emerges from the wood.  Top of the chest is covered with cones of 
the pine trees.  The drawers are magical and can store any amount of things.

    <desc>Fresh, juicy vegetables grow in this part of earth.  Pinkish-yellow pumpkins 
are to the west, while crimson, fleshy, lustrous tomatoes are to the east.  
Covering them is sticky sap originating from the veins of a large creeper.  
The vine spreads across the patch like a long, green snake.  Stones and 
pebbles surround the area.  A rickety, old, wooden, cracked fence surrounds 
the border of the garden.  To the north stands an entrance gate which can 
swing open in both directions.  Wisps of vapour emerge from a tall chimney 
to the east, where the gamekeeper's hut can be seen.  A grove of magical, 
evergreen trees are to the west, southwest, and northeast, while vast 
grounds roll open to the north, south, northeast, and southeast.

    <desc>A dozen maple trees stand huddled together, littering the yellowing grass 
with their brilliant, red foliage.  More leaves, these ones aureate, sweep 
in from the northern Forbidden Forest and from the Whomping Willow, further 
west; paths lead in both directions.  Lanes also run south to the 
gamekeeper's vegetable patch, southwest to another grove, and west and 
northwest to the Hogwarts Outer Wall.  Slightly separated from the grove, 
the statue of a man lunges sideways, surrounded by mushrooms.  He is dumpy 
and working on increasing his waistline, if the numerous, purple bunches of 
grapes and diverse nuts spread on the couch-like socle are any indication.  
Among the seeds is also nestled an oval emerald; however, the jewel is 
partly covered by the man's robes.  A small crown of vine leaves adorns his 
head, fluttering in a recurrent breeze that keeps the temperature pleasantly 
autumnal.

    <copyright>Copyright © 2004-2010  Project Legilimensia</copyright>
    <desc>The thick smell of closely-huddled oaks hangs humidly in the air, mixed with 
the timid sweetness of linden leaves.  Hungry branches stretch westward 
towards the lonely Hogwarts wall, their spindly fingers often ending in 
sharp, claw-like tips.  A strange, perpetual wind beats against the high, 
stone barrier, rounding its chipped edges and planting mounds of twigs and 
small branches all over its lower half.  Blades of grass tentatively grow 
around whatever vertical protection it finds against the fierce winds, while 
moss and vines crawl amidst engorged tree roots, into the darkness of the 
woods.  The stern shape of Hogwarts is distinguishable in the distance to 
the east, beyond the forest, piercing the sky with large, stone towers and 
turrets.  To the southeast, a large, iron gate watches over the road that 
connects Hogsmeade to the wizarding school.  The ominous shadow of the 
Forbidden Forest crawls ever-nearer from the north.  
</desc>
    <editdraft>Forcibly caught in a thicket of strong, contorted oaks and fresh-scented 
pines, a high wall vibrates here with deep, powerful magic.  Sweet and 
acrid, fresh and rotting perfumes always battle here, their strange harmony 
thrumming with vitality and hatred.  For anyone mounted atop the twenty feet 
barrier, the world is obstructed by branches thrusting from both sides.  It 
could not be clearer that the vegetation is loath to be restricted by the 
heavily scarred stone, and in the permanent winds that ravage this area, the 
trees growl and scream their displeasure.  Complex wards make a descent on 
the western side impossible, but a great deal of bravery against an angry 
clump of southwestern oaks could result in a passage into the Forbidden 
Forest.  A slightly more appealing route for one mounted atop the wall could 
be to brace the howling winds and vicious tree branches and head south along 
the chipped granite.  
</editdraft>
    <editeds>I've very slightly rephrased the ed (move the however and its place).
 
As for echoes, in number 2, if the Forest is immutable, it shouldn't change at all, I think; so please use rather &quot;calm&quot; or &quot;stiff&quot;.
The rest is golden!

    <editfirstcomments>Hello there dear Samba queen!
 
 
Okay, I'm offering a very slight rewriting. Mostly, it's all suggestions; The only thing I'd really like you to change, is the second occurrence of &quot;mounted atop the wall&quot;.
 
See you!

      <desc>This wall is made from grey granite, though its surface is hardly visible 
beyond intertwined vines and branches.  The strong enchantments doubtlessly 
responsible for the fact that the barrier still stands tall have been unable 
to prevent the insistent, vicious attacks of the Forbidden Forest, however.  
The stone is heavily scarred, its texture uneven and ominously cracked in 
places, some of the wounds running down its side till they reach the ground. 
 Acrid scents stain every inch of the wall's barrier, probably coming from a 
multitude of apparently-rotting vines, which struggle to penetrate the 
granite with their strong grip.

    <desc>The dark cobblestones of the wall walk are worn smooth in this area, their 
erosion the product of centuries of passing students.  They seem to flow 
together, giving the illusion of a calm granite sea, so even is their 
wearing.  The state of the stones gives an odd harmony to the view, 
overlooking the vast lake that lies to the east of Hogwarts proper.  
Mountains, their peaks topped in snow and cloud, can be seen framing the 
loch.  The air tastes fresh here, far excluded from the bustle of Muggle 
cities.  The wind carries a soft scent of pine from the forests so prevalent 
in this part of Scotland.  The path continues to the north and northwest.  
To the west lies the lake.

    <desc>A narrow, well-worn, cobblestone path, covered for the most part by grass 
and wild plants, stretches to the north of the firm, dull-grey, granite 
wall.  Silver-coloured ivy stains the entire area, reaching out over all the 
stone surfaces in its path, embracing them tightly with its strong fingers.  
The wall is smooth and rounded by excessive winds, its southern side bathing 
into the Hogwarts Lake.  The ripples and whispers of the water echo deeply 
against the thick barrier, which enriches the sound and reiterates it over 
and over again.  Hanging heavily in the surrounding air is the dizzying 
perfume of damp willows.  To the north stands Hogwarts Castle, a short 
distance away from the faint silhouette of the Quidditch Pitch.  In the far 
background stretches the dark-green curtain of the dangerous Forbidden 
Forest.  The wall runs parallel to it for a while, to the west, coming to an 
end to the southeast.

      <desc>The thick, silvery vines stretch over the entire surface of the wall and on 
the nearby, stone path.  The plant is strong, pulsating like an 
unusually-elastic blood-vessel, its leaves outstretched and probing the air. 
 At the end of every leaf is a thin needle that vibrates occasionally like 
an antenna of sorts.

    <desc>Chipped in many places, but still standing strong, the granite wall slithers 
to the east and west, parallel to the vastness of the Lake.  To the south, a 
small patch of ground leads down a mild slope towards a lane of weeds 
growing by the river side.  The web of ivy that grows tightly against the 
wall lavishly snakes on the ground, dipping its fingers into the waves.  A 
carpet of grass, tinselled with dark-green bushes and, in season, with 
dark-red roses, stretches to the north of the stone barrier, over the entire 
Grounds.  The Forbidden Forest stands far into the distance, like a 
sinister, dank background to the magnificent Quidditch Pitch.  The Hogwarts 
Castle rises tall to the northeast, its turrets and towers plunging sharply 
into the sky.  The air is filled with a deeply-sweet perfume of damp 
willows, mixed with the freshness of the nearby grass.

      <desc>The Quidditch Pitch is surrounded by large stands, in the shape of a tall 
parallelepiped, made of beige sandstone on the outside and oak on the 
inside.  Two groups of three hoops each stand at the northern and southern 
ends of the field, symmetrically placed with respect to a commentary box and 
a scoreboard that stand opposite one another, along the eastern and western 
edges.  Shredded pieces of cloth flutter high, at the top of the arena, 
although they are too far away to distinguish in detail.

      <desc>The Castle is made of the same, grey granite of the wall, but fierce winds 
have rounded its edges, while preserving its magnificence.  Ivy, in 
different shades of green and silver, creeps out of the school's upper 
windows and greedily stretches along the its sides.  Many turrets and towers 
plunge into the sky, giving Hogwarts the appearance of a phoenix rising from 
the ground, with outstretched wings.  The citadel towers over the grounds, 
bathing them in gentle streaks of shadows whenever the sun shines on the 
sky.

them.

    <editdraft>.  The trees that are visible here are so magnificent that it is hardly 
possible to notice anything else but the trees.  They are covered in what 
seems to be pink and baby blue flowers from trunk to treetop.  There are no 
visible holes in the trees, only flowers.  On the north side are Four 
Warriors Statues, to the east is another exit, and in a southern direction 
is the Hogwarts wall.  To the west and southeast continues the Hogwarts 
Wall.  There is an exit to the northwest as well.

    <desc>Bushes in various tones of green are spread over the fresh, grass carpet 
that stretches on the entire surface of the Hogwarts grounds.  A vast 
curtain of trees rises far to the north, darkening the horizon like the 
sinister background of a magnificent painting.  A structure of beige 
sandstone, barely marred by time and weather, hugs the Quidditch Pitch.  
Mirroring its magnificence, the grey granite of Hogwarts Castle to the 
northeast is reassuring and peaceful.  As the wall rounds a corner to the 
southeast, heading towards the vast mirror of the Lake, its hard surface is 
rounded and weather-beaten, bordered by a thicket of trees to the south and 
by grass to the north.  Further to the west, another corner brings the stone 
barrier closer to the stone pathway that connects the massive, iron Gates 
with the entrance to the Castle.  A discreet perfume lingers sweetly in the 
air, mixing with the fresh aroma of the nearby trees.

      <desc>The corner of the stands surrounding the Quidditch Pitch is rounded, made of 
the same, beige sandstone that covers the outside of the arena.  Apart from 
the occasional streaks of grey, the structure has withstood the passage of 
time well.  Etchings are visible about two feet down from the upper rim of 
the stadium, perpetually moving in what looks to be an illustration of a 
Quidditch match.  The angle allows a distant view of a commentary box, 
placed halfway on the inside, eastern part of the stands, exactly opposite a 
large, wooden board.

    <desc>Vines of strong, persistent ivy are entangled with the little branches of a 
patch of contorted, lonely trees that stand to the south, thus preventing 
them from further scarring the surface of the granite barrier.  Far to the 
north, beyond the pathway of stone that leads from the gates into Hogwarts 
Castle, is the Forbidden Forest, throbbing with the rhythms of life.  A 
carpet of fresh grass is stretched over the grounds, decorated in season 
with small flowers of all colours.  In warm times, thorny rose beds spread 
over the green colour, in a mass of bleeding passion.  The Quidditch Pitch, 
majestic and grand as it is, is dwarfed by the size and beauty of Hogwarts.  
The castle is made of the same granite as the wall and spreads an aura of 
reassurance and peace.  Small willows lead the way southeast, towards the 
vast stillness of the lake, prodding at it with the tips of their long 
fingers.  To the west, the wall turns towards the gates, while to the east 
it gently leads towards the waterside, always bordered by trees.

even when the breeze is so light that one does not feel it.  Trees lead 
towards it, becoming more frequent as the dampness increases.  Their 
branches and trunks are stretched southward, in an attempt to draw nearer to 
the water side.  Some stones firmly stand between the last of the 
surrounding blades of grass and the Lake, as though they were ancient, 
steady guardians, eroded by time, but never defeated.

      <desc>Even from the distance, the perfection of the Castle is visible.  Unmarred 
by time and the caprices of both weather and enemy attacks, the granite 
surface is as steady as ever and emanating the same reassuring aura.  Like a 
Phoenix rising from the ground, with outstretched wings, the building has 
towers and turrets plunging into the sky with the force of a dagger, but 
without its violence.  An echo of freedom and power erupts mutely from every 
bit of stone.

    <desc>Large thickets of oaks and rosewood trees are clustered around the western 
side of the wall, their arms and fingers wrapped around each other in a web 
that hides anything beyond them.  During the day, the faint murmurs of a 
distant life hint to the presence of a village further to the west.  Utterly 
unrestricted from view, the Quidditch Pitch rises tall eastward upon a 
carpet of grass tinselled with dark-green bushes.  Further southeast, 
crimson tears peek from amidst the sea of green surrounding them, barely 
identifiable as flowers.  Bordering the grounds in the southern distance 
stretches the ever-changing surface of the lake.  Opposite it, the large, 
dark veil of the Forbidden Forest covers the entire horizon, its jaws 
wrapped around the end of the wall, which resolutely continues northwest 
towards it.  To the southeast, the wall slithers towards the waterside.

      <desc>From the distance, little of the lake can be seen beyond the rocks and many 
willows at its edge.  Its blue surface is, however, as clear and still as a 
well-cleaned mirror on days with no wind, although the occasional breeze 
might make it tremble slightly.  The water reflects any sunlight it receives 
in golden nimbuses that look like suspended bridges of light.

      <desc>Stands are placed in a high parallelepiped around the Quidditch field.  Two 
groups of three hoops each symmetrically stand at the northern and southern 
ends of the field.  The tips of the hoops are visible from the Hogwarts 
Wall, the metal giving off a dim, cold light, even in the absence of the 
sun.  All across the beige sandstone of the arena are etchings moving in a 
chaotic manner, but they are too far to make out properly.

    <desc>The wall serpentines north and southeast, alongside patches of young oaks.  
The trees push with their twigs against the surface of the wall, scratching 
its rounded, weather-beaten edges in patternless, crisscrossing lines.  
Through a web of branches, a distant side-path of Hogsmeade is barely 
visible slithering before a large manor.  The Quidditch Pitch rises to the 
east, surrounded by gigantic, light-coloured, rectangular stands.  
Dark-green bushes crawl all the way between the large arena and the stone 
barrier, decorating the carpet of grass like tinsel would adorn a Christmas 
Tree.  The deep-blue water of a lake is discernible to the southeast, 
surrounded by a belt of willows and rocks.

The structure is rectangular, made of beige sandstone.  Two large entrances, 
about ten feet tall, stand on the northern and southern sides of the edge 
that runs parallel to the Hogwarts Wall When the wind screams through the

for a particularly-beautiful goal.

clawed scars upon its stone surface.  The old trees creak as they bend 
northward, where the shadows of the Forbidden Forest loom like a sinister 
sea of darkness.  To the east, rising in a perfect, rectangular shape, 
stands the Quidditch Pitch.  Marvellous stands lifted high in the air dwarf 
the beech trees at the base of the arena, while green hedges embrace the 
walls of a small broom shed a few feet away.  Glistening with occasional 
rays of sunshine that draw the eye southward, the uneven, blue surface of a 
beautiful lake stretches far in the distance.  The view improves and becomes 
more accurate as the stone barrier turns outwards, to the southwest.  To the 
far north, a large, iron door breaks the wall into two halves.

      <desc>Edging into view is the Hogwarts lake, its contours snaking around 
dazzlingly-white rocks and tall willow trees.  The clear surface of the 
water is a perfect blue colour during most of the year, while during the 
more severe of winters, it is covered by a layer of ice, sometimes thick 
enough to walk on.  Mixed scents of algae, weeds, and waterside flowers 
spread in the surrounding air, reaching even as far as the wall.

      <desc>Large stands surround the Quidditch arena, where the students of Hogwarts 
can practise their skills and play for their House teams.  Three hoops on 
either side of the field stand at the end of long, golden poles that catch 
any sunlight and reflect it in magnificent shimmers.  Slight dents in the 
surfaces of the hoops show where hard objects have struck them, while 
fragments of banners and scarves caught and shredded in the stands hint at 
the passion with which the game is followed.

    <editdraft>.  A circle of tall birch trees inhabit this area.  They seem to be planted 
to represent something, though whatever it represents doesn't seem to be too 
clear.  The trees have red, gold, white, silver, bronze, yellow, black, and 
blue leaves.  They produce a scent that smells oddly like the common rooms 
of Hogwarts.  On the north side of this room is a Grove, to the east are 
some Hogwarts Grounds, and in a southern direction is more romantic stuff.  
Westward is the Hogwarts wall.  There are exits northeast, southeast, 
southwest, and northwest too.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Michael, remember how I asked you to not put in more than 3 exits in 1 
sentence?  It's a bit too long and heavy to read for the players.  Also, you 
forgot to write in desc that you claimed this room, and your past room.  
I've written it for you, just FYI :) also, last thing, since this room has 
exits in all 8 directions, it'd be much easier to say: exits lead to all 
directions (if you're not feeling up to describing each one), just a 
suggestion though, of course :) for your next time.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Your ed is fine the way it is, but perhaps you could specify which scents 
these trees give, as trees are not normally known to give off a smell unless 
they have fruit or something.  :) thanks!  `-mira

    <desc>Standing southward from the Hogwarts Castle and surrounded on all sides by 
numerous groves and healthy trees, this area seems immensely sad.  Short, 
yellow blades of grass wreathe lifelessly along the ground around an old 
barren tree.  Its branches are leafless throughout the whole year, and 
judging by the old, exhausted look of the tree, it must have been around for 
ages already.  Even so, the large width of the trunk still testifies that 
this tree once had a promising life before something devastated it.  The 
dark brown, at places even grey bark of this melancholic tree is completely 
dry, its many plies curling and falling off.  This whole scene invokes a 
depressing, sorrowful image; despite the heavy, sick tiredness in the air, 
however, there is still a ray of hope on this land, taking the shape of an 
evergreen flower.  A few small, blue flowers, similar to the periwinkle, 
grow next to the tree's ancient roots, their innocent beauty glowing next to 
the haunting image of a dying tree.

    <editdraftcomments>Absolutely breathtaking! When I first saw this patch, I had a feeling I was editing poetry, and not prose. It's beautiful, how you portray the tree and then the flower. My only edits are somewhat technical, taking out a repetitive word, or twisting the phrase a bit to make it clearer. If you, however, disagree with any of the edits, please don't hesitate to speak up, love! Great, hauntingly-beautiful room! `-Cristina

    <editeds>Awesome echoes; those should really enforce the atmosphere! One small edit though: Please add a comma between &quot;small&quot; and &quot;crimson&quot; in echo number 1. `-Cristina

climbs to the upper tiers, a three-foot-high, thick, sandstone barrier keeps 
the spectators within the stadium.  Jumping off is out of the question; a 
magical shield enforces the safety of this high position.  From the 
sandstone wall, rows of solid, oak benches tumble down towards a lower 
margin, and a narrow beam of wood separates the spectators from the roar of 
the Quidditch players.  The arena is adjacent to the stands to the east and 
southeast, with three hoops placed at either end of the pitch.  The benches 
in this area continue to the north and south and have various heights, as 
though to ensure that the smaller spectators have a place at the front and 
the taller, at the back.  A large banner in the colours of Gryffindor House 
is wrapped against the interior edge of the stands.

      <desc>This banner is old, probably dating back at least a century.  The texture is 
soft, but made of natural silk, weaved together with something stronger, 
probably linen.  The motif is repeated over and over again, every three 
feet: the Gryffindor lion, poised for a strike.  The makers of the arena 
have made sure the relic cannot be touched or harmed, as several 
enchantments, amongst which a Permanent Sticking Charm, make it 
invulnerable.  Beneath it beam glowing, crimson letters, spelling out: 
&quot;Semper Victorius!&quot;

    <editdraft>The grass of the field is ever so soft and green, in season.  It is 
pristine, and primped with painstaking perfection.  The creamy-white field 
paint continues around the oval shaped field, marking its sidelines.  To the 
north, a large Gryffindor banner is draped lovingly from the top of the 
locker room.  To the northeast, three large goal posts shoot out from a 
sandy pit.  To the east the field continues on towards the other sideline.  
The exact centre of the field, marked with a large circle of the same white 
paint, lies to the southeast.  Directly south, the paint marking the 
sideline continues to eastern midfield.

    <editdraft>Grass, a bright shade of green, covers the north centre baseline of the 
field.  The grain of the grass flows north and south, alternating the shade 
of green slightly in each column.  To the east and west are the sidelines 
and beyond them the wall.  To the immediate south sits the center of the 
field.  Southeast and southwest, are the centre lines of the field and their 
perspective sidelines.  Directly north, the elusive goal posts protrude out 
of the sandy ground.

Field Paing : `WHalf circle facing south joining sand to grass.
</desc>
    <editdraft>Three posts shoot out of the ground towards the sky.  The center post 
slightly higher then the other two, whichare on its east and west sides.  
The ground is a half circle of light-tan coloured sand.  On the outer 
reaches of the sand, white field paint attaches the sand to the grass.  To 
all northern directions is the wall surrounding the Quidditch Pitch.  To the 
south, in al directions, the Quidditch Pitch playing field continues.

    <desc>Like a storming, restless sea, benches of various sizes are propped here 
upon a thick layer of sandstone.  The beige colour of the rock is worn and 
old, stretching all the way from an eastern, darker-coloured edge to a 
western wall that runs all the way up, disappearing beyond an upper tier of 
the Quidditch Pitch.  Wooden steps in a warm, oak colour lead upstairs, to 
the better seats.  All access is denied to the east, as that is where the 
players emerge from; however, it is possible to enter the vast, 
seasonally-green expanse of the stadium to the southeast.  Beyond the exit 
of the changing rooms, three poles are deeply enrooted into the earth, 
leading high up towards three hoops - the goal area.  Rounded and smoothed 
by much wear, the sandstone floor continues to border the large arena to the 
south, and northeast, ending to the north in a large archway that provides 
an exit to the grounds.

    <desc>The enormous Quidditch Pitch blocks the east of this narrow path.  The lane 
is a sad sight, since it is quite barren and with not even a leaf in sight.  
The ground seems infertile, with wide cracks spreading across the entire 
area.  Broken twigs and branches lie defeated on either side of the road; an 
anthill towers amongst remnants of broken life.  To the north, a low, black 
figure can be easily discerned against the barren dryness, while a huge slab 
of rock lies midway along the southwestern trail.  An inaccessible corner of 
a shed stands out to the northwest.  With a narrow trail leading south and 
an enormous chariot towering to the west, this area is narrow, cramped, and 
terribly depressing.

:) just a few things, grammar wise, as always.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>1. In your last three echoes echoes, you have stone figures moving. Of course, this is possible since we're at Hogwarts, but I found it confusing that the horse is moving and yet we don't hear any strange noise from stone moving. I will suggest a rephrase here, but of course, this is more of a design decision, so feel free to rephrase differently and to send me a note to that effect.
 
- Echo 2: 'The red, stone horse docilely lowers its head; the move is accompanied by a heavy, grinding noise.'
 
- Echo 3: 'The blue, stone horse shakes its mane with a crackling noise and whinnies impatiently in a rich, low sound.'
 
- Echo 4: 'The stone horses neigh in unison, their voices exhilarating, deep, and rich.'
 
EDs:
 
I've tweaked all your eds, though no great changes were needed. I like your sculpture here very much! `-Cristina

    <editfirst>The whole western vista is blocked out by the harsh line of the Outer Wall.  
To the north stands a massive broom shed; the reason why it is there (is 
because) the Quidditch Pitch overshadows the eastern and southeastern 
borders of this area.  A paved path leads northeast to the (e)ntrance to the 
Pitch, while six other, equally-paved lanes radiate from the centre of this 
patch of grass to the east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and 
northwest.  In the said centre, a slightly-raised, round platform serves as 
pedestal for a(n) impressive sculptural ensemble.  Two statues of horses, 
one blue, one red, are harnessed to a heavily-decorated chariot.  The latter 
is topped with a baldachin and driven by the stone figure of a man.

    <editsecond>The whole western vista is blocked out by the harsh line of the Hogwarts 
outer wall.  To the north stands a massive broom shed, directly in the 
shadow of the massive Quidditch Pitch, which looms to the east and southeast 
of the area.  A paved path leads northeast to the entrance to the arena, 
while six other, equally-paved lanes radiate from the middle of this 
grass-covered patch, to the east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and 
northwest.  Where the paths meet, in the centre, a slightly-raised, round 
platform serves as pedestal for an impressive, sculptural ensemble.  Two 
statues of horses, one blue, one red, are harnessed to a heavily-decorated 
chariot topped with a baldachin and driven by the stone figure of a man.  
</editsecond>
    <editsecondcomments>A generally lovely room. I've just tweaked bits and pieces here and there. Probably the most notable changes are where I've taken some of the more 'scientific' turns of phrase you use, such as 'the said centre', which are impersonal and sound distant. `-Cristina

      <desc>Each of the seven paths is laid out with white-enamelled tiles, and green 
seams define an alternation of rhombic and pentagonal shapes.  More rhombus 
slabs line the borders of the lanes.  These paths cut straight through the 
grass from the round, central platform to the edges of the patch.  Amusingly 
enough, the lawn is the exact same green as the lines joining the tiles.

      <desc>The man is decked in a very formal, elegant robe; on top of it, his 
magnificently-decorated breastplate serves more as an ornament than as 
protection.  Likewise, the man looks too young, too cocky, and above all, 
too care-free, to be a true warrior.  A knotworked headband and a sceptre 
deem him a rather arrogant princeling.

      <desc>The chariot is perched on two three-foot-wide wheels; these are carved out 
of wood and reinforced with a thin, golden, metal layer.  The chariot itself 
is wrought out of same metal and a three-foot-tall parapet encloses it on 
three sides.  From the four corners of this safeguard rise four slim 
columns, two red, two blue.  A heavy, velvet canopy leans on these pillars.  
One of the blue columns also sports a shallowly-outlined rectangle, in which 
are engraved the letters &quot;VII&quot;.

    <desc>Claimed by Melentolos and Kanru!  
 
Field Paint: `W)

    <editdraft>Soft, bright green, ever fresh-cut grass, covers the northeastern baseline.  
Near the bludger beaten wall, a solemn white line tapers off to the north 
and south in a never ending cycle around the pitch.  To the northwest are 
the goalposts.  To the north a bright yellow sheet with the Hufflepuff Crest 
silently waves, the yellow sticks out from the drab grey of the walls..  To 
the south is the eastern midfield.  To the southwest is midfield.  To the 
northeast, east, and southeast is the wall seperating the Quidditch Pitch 
and the Hogwarts School Grounds.  
</editdraft>
    <editeds>Your echo labeled as #0 needs to be changed to: The badger rears up on its 
hind legs and roars at the Quidditch Pitch, then settles back down to sleep 
in the crevice of a large, (calligraphied) 'H'.  Also, echo #2 should be: A 
light breeze blows through the field; the smell of fresh cut grass wafts 
into the air.  OR A light breeze blows through the field, (sending) the 
smell of fresh cut grass (wafting) into the air.  Lastly, I have edited your 
ed.  Please take a look!  `-mira

    <desc>Seven, identical, yellow hooks are firmly planted on the eastern wall of the 
Hufflepuff Locker Room.  Underneath each hook, a foot of space separates 
three, mahogony shelves.  A thin, - albeit opaque - black curtain forms a 
semi-circle around each area, giving the owner of the makeshift-locker 
privacy.  The floor is a clear, glass plate.  Each time something touches 
it, the object is immediately outlined in a sparkling, white shimmer.  Under 
the otherwise-translucent ground, a whirl of yellow and black smoke dances 
beautifully.  Wrapping around each other fondly, the colours seem unable to 
mix.  The western wall is bare but for alternating yellow and black stripes. 
 Four feet away from the wall, a glittering, yellow box sits proudly on the 
smooth ground, its base outlined in a white shimmer.  A heavy, yellow drape 
can be pulled aside to move south onto the Quidditch Pitch, while an oak 
door leads northeast to an entrance to the stadium.  
</desc>
    <editeds>I've changed this desc a bit: miniscule should be minuscule, and the descriptions of the marks on the miniature figures was a bit muddled. I love this miniature team, by the way!

    <editfirstcomments>Hello! This is mostly golden: I'm suggesting taking out the dashes on each side of opaque, and a rephrasing for the second occurrence of the white shimmer outline.

      <desc>This yellow box can be opened only by the captain of the Hufflepuff 
Quidditch team.  Once opened, however, fourteen, miniature figures on brooms 
fly out of the box and aline themselves in midair, awaiting instructions.  
Half dressed in yellow and half in beige, a clear &quot;b&quot; is visible on the back 
of four of them, whilst a &quot;s&quot; is crafted on the back of two, a loopy &quot;k&quot; 
decorates the rear of two, and a &quot;c&quot; marks the backs of six.  The ones with 
&quot;b&quot;s are each holding tiny bats, and one of the &quot;c&quot; figures is holding a 
small, red ball.  Three other balls levitate just in front of the players - 
two miniscule black ones and a hardly-visible, golden one.  Used as a 
demonstration for plays, this set of figurines is unique and quite 
impressive.

    <editdraft>The smooth, soft grass that covers the Pitch is here trisected by the 
winding sideline to the east, stretching on endlessly to the north and 
south, and the midline that bisects this patch of grass cleanly in two.  To 
the northeast, east, and southeast is the wall separating the pitch and the 
school grounds, and also supporting the massive stands above.  To the north 
is the entrance to the Hufflepuff locker room.  To the west are the great, 
massive lines that encompass the midfield line.  To the southwest is the 
southern centre baseline in front of the massive, yet slender, goal posts.  
To the south is the entrance to the Slytherin locker room.

    <editdraft>The field marking here from the center of the sidelines on the west side fo 
the field and also the line slashing through the centre of the field and 
continues to the eastern sideline severing the centrefield circle marking in 
half.  The grass is the same as everyother part of this lush green field.  
Tiny yellow buttercups blossom in a tiny circular shape, the size of a 
bludger, during the spring.  The field continues on in all directions, 
except for the western borders, where the huge Quidditch wall towers over 
the playing field.

other gardening implements is heaped together in an attempt to get them out 
of the way.  Most are rusted from rainstorms and humidity.  Near the

    <editdraftcomments>Your first sentence here was a bit awkward, so I tried to make it clearer.  
And all of the exits are mentioned, yay!  Lastly, in your first sentence, if 
you meant 'dark' to go with 'green', like the color, then you can either 
eliminate the comma inbetween that I put there, or you can still eliminate 
it and put a hyphen between them if you like.  Either way will work.

scattered soil from the nearby greenhouses.  The humid air emanating from 
these learning facilities escapes at ground level in light jets of steam, 
while the rest remains trapped inside, fogging the insides of the glass

visible through the misty panes.  Several snails and slugs loiter nearby, 
enjoying the warm vapor from the greenhouses.  A stack of cracked and 
chipped earthen pots lean against the eastern greenhouse, while the wall of 
the western greenhouse supports several wooden carts.  A steaming pile of 
compost to the north provides a stench that is only exacerbated by the humid

    <editdraftcomments>Chris, only 3 small things here.  I threw in a comma, took out one comma,

upward from it and dissipating in the surrounding air.  A dark, earthy smell 
emanates from the pile, with slightly rank overtones.  Earth-worms burrow 
busily in and out, having claiming the compost heap as their home; the grass 
near and underneath the pile is withered, having turned a straw-like shade 
of yellow from lack of light.  The compost has been kicked about a bit and 
some of the smelly substance lies scattered away from the main heap; on one 
side, the compost is a fresh, dark brown colour and a shovel sticks out from 
the side of the heap that is decomposing fertilizer.  A few flowers have 
sprouted up on the outskirts of the pile.  Rocky grounds spread north and 
northwest of this point; a narrow pathway leads south between the 
greenhouses, while westward lies the back entrance of one of these 
glass-covered chambers.  To the east rises a large statue, mockingly 
mirrored to the northwest by a fallen tree.

    <editdraftcomments>Chris, it's great to see your writing again!  No major changes here, just a 
handful of tweaks.  Great stuff though, for a compost pile, hehe :) 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1. Please change echo 0 to: 'A butterfly lazily floats by, borne by a slow breeze; it flutters down and perches on top of the heap. A moment later, it leaps again to be carried away by the wind.' The echo is too long right now. FYI, Mira, lovely girl, 'born' refers to babies coming into the world, whereas 'borne' means carried. (in British spelling, at least). I've left the 'borne' in.
 
2. Please change the timing of the echo to daylight only, so, say, 11 am to 5 pm. Butterflies don't go out at night.
 
EDS:
 
1. I've edited your ed, please take a look at it when you have the time. Again, I've taken out a few of the past tenses and in the last sentence I specified what 'it' was, since it sounded like you referred to the handle, which had been removed. `-Cristina

    <editsecondcomments>Lovely Chris, most of your text was absolutely dandy. The changes that I have, however, made, were meant to cut on the many past tenses and passive structures that you use. The reason for this is that we want the writing to be very, very vivid and fresh, while passive structures and past tenses slow the writing. 
 
As a second point, you missed some of the exits, and even those that you did write were a bit generalized, making them a bit inaccurate. I've suggested some rephrasing to give you an idea of what we want. If you want to reword this differently, please do, but make sure you sent me a note saying that you changed it, so I can take a last look. Otherwise, dandy room; you have a good capacity of describing things in detail and I like that! `-Cristina

green.  The take-offs before each match have done their damage to this area, 
no amount of magic can straighten the broken blades of gass, nor can they 
remove the strange depressed grass growing in a perfect rectangle near the 
centre of midfield.  The lines intersect and cut this area into two half 
circles and the area just outside of the perfectly white midfield paint.  To 
the north and south are the centre baselines.  To the east and west, the 
sidelines extending in both directions after each other.  To the northeast

Strangely the Quidditch Ball case has exactly the same surface area, the box

&quot;students&quot; in your 2nd sentence.  It broke it up and caused an unnatural 
pause for me, so I think it's best left out.  Other than that, you're golden 

</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Hahahahahaha.  LOVE the ed :) *sniffles for fred* *oh and george too, but 
sniffles louder since he is more hard of hearing now* *cries* everything is 
in perfect working order here, no edits.  `-mira

    <editfirst>A worn, shapeless streak of beige sandstone marks the most trodden part of 
these stands, extending from the northern Gryffindor section to the southern 
Ravenclaw corner.  Encased to the west, above, and below by rock, this level 
is meant for late-arriving students who have missed the best seats in the 
upper tiers.  A discreet set of oak-coloured steps leads upwards; a message 
spelled in shimmering, golden writing is embedded in the stone beside the 
lowest stair.  Determined to be hospitable, the makers of the stands have 
placed benches here, their plain, wooden surface occasionally decorated by 
artistically-inclined students.  A three-foot-tall eastern wall separates 
the pitch from this area; prudently, the students have left this area 
unmarked by personal banners belonging to any house.

      <desc>These steps are carved in solid wood, though they have the enchanted 
immobility and durability of steel.  A banister is offered as support for 
any who might need it, its rounded part showing signs of deeply dug-in nails 
and furious fist-slams.  At the very base of the staircase is a glittering, 
shimmering message spelling, &quot;If you're not strong enough to take a Bludger, 
stay down!  Love, Fred and George.&quot;

    <desc>This section of the stands is decorated in a stunning combination of deep 
blue and gold, its appearance regal and noble.  Though sandstone blocks 
border this area to the west, above, and below, the more frequent visitors 
here have decorated the beige rock with blue and bronze drapes and carpets.  
The lush, soft carpet underfoot is unmarked by the passage of time, and most 
likely held in place by Permanent Sticking charms; its depth is mesmerising, 
calm, and powerfully-emotional at the same time, as though the hue changed 
depending on the pair of eyes watching it.  A large banner in the colours of 
Ravenclaw House hangs down the inside part of a three-foot-tall eastern 
wall, which separates the pitch itself from the stands.  Additional 
enchantments are placed around this barrier so that it prevents exit onto 
the arena; however, movement is possible to the north, south, and up a 
flight of oak steps towards an upper tier.

      <desc>This carpet feels comforting to the touch, its colour a deep, endless blue.  
Tiny, bronze scribbling appears and disappears across it, spelling either 
names or encouragements meant for the Ravenclaw Quidditch team.  The actual 
hue of the covering is indefinable, changing subtly into comforting, 
calming, tense, or exhilarated tinges to respond to the feelings of the 
passers-by.

    <editdraft>The white stripe, encompassing the Quidditch Pitch field continues on in all 
northern directions, perfectly keeps its round, yet strat edged shape.  The 
grass is green as the robes Slytherins wear, its grain stretching north up 
the field.  To the south, the Ravenclaw locker room, boldly stands out from 
the view of the marvelous wall behind it.  The flag on the Ravenclaw locker 
room hangs on a pole extending at a forty-five degree angle above its 
entrance.  To the east is the baseline in the centre of the Quidditch Pitch, 
where the grass meets with the sand infront of the towering goalposts.

not work, as this is kind of an open aired area.  Make sense?  You're not in 
a 4 walled room.  So, it should just read 'flies about' or 'flies about the

    <editdraftcomments>Hello, boys :) first off, I did change a bit of your ending.  It was too 
redundant the way you always name your exits, so I tried working with it 
while attempting to keep your wording as best I could.  If you have any 
concerns, please let me know!  Thanks so much.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>The only comment I have for your echoes is in #0, it should be: its jaws.  
Not it's.  Like I mentioned before, it's = it is, and is not possessive :) 
please be careful about this, it's an easy mistake to make.  I did edit both 
of your eds as well.  1 small thing, please add &quot;grass&quot; as a keyword to your 
blade ed, because players may also type: look grass.  Please also use 
spellcheck in a word (or something similar) program before submitting your 
work!  It'll help you with misspelled words which saves me time.  Thanks so 
much!  `-mira

    <desc>. Forest-green wardrobes stand nobly against the weathered walls of the 
Slytherin locker room.  A once-white carpet covers the floor, hiding its 
face from view.  Torches, glowing a bright, green flame, line the walls 
above the wardrobes.  A large, wooden bench runs through the centre of the 
room, its glossy finish reflecting the light of the torches.  A chalkboard 
stands directly opposite the bench, a play scratched out on its green 
surface.  The ceiling is green, with moving, white streaks splashed across 
its body.  A heavy, white curtain takes the place of windows here, and leads 
north to the Quidditch Pitch, so that the players can fly from the locker 
room to the field.  A white, mahogany door leads southeast to an entrance to 
the Quidditch Pitch.

    <editeds>Hello!
 
The ceiling ed is golden. I'm suggesting a rewrite for the wardrobes one though: the &quot;front of each space&quot; sounded a bit too convoluted and I think you meant bolt rather than hinges to keep close the door.
 
Also, the word &quot;forest-green&quot; should be added to the keyword of the wardrobes ed, as well as &quot;white&quot; to the ceiling one.

    <editfirst>Forest-green wardrobes stand nobly against the southern wall of the 
Slytherin locker room.  A once-white carpet covers the floor, hiding its 
face from view.  Torches, glowing a bright, green flame, line the walls 
above the wardrobes.  A large, wooden bench runs along the eastern wall, its 
glossy finish reflecting the light of the torches.  A chalkboard stands 
directly opposite this bench, a play scratched out on its green surface.  
The ceiling is green, with moving, white streaks splashed across its body.  
A heavy, white curtain acts as a rice paer-covered, French window on the 
north wall and leads on to the Quidditch Pitch, so that the players can fly 
out of the locker room and into the field.  A white, wooden door leads 
southeast to an entrance to the Quidditch Pitch.  
</editfirst>
    <editfirstcomments>Hello dear Jess!
 
I have a few questions about your desc:
 
1) If the bench is in the middle of the room, how can the chalkboard be directly opposite it? I have trouble visualising the relative place of each here.
 
2) I don't really understand how the white curtain serve as window: do you mean it let some light in, like a rice paper-covered window? Plus, since it's used to flying into the QP, would it be more like a door or a French window?
 
3) If the north wall is partly taken by the curtain, the wardrobes may not stand against every wall of the room (especially as they would only be 7 of them I think).
 
4) Isn't mahogany usually dark-red? If it's painted, how would the common man reg-cognised it as mahogany, just by the grain?

      <desc>The green ceiling is splashed with moving, white streaks.  The lines of 
paint twist and turn as though writhing in pain.  They stretch out, filling 
the whole space of the metallic ceiling and then contract again, using as 
little space as possible.  Forming loops and curves, they move along the 
edge of the ceiling, as though trying to hide, and then take form in the 
centre.  Dancing horribly, they silently scream with anguish.

the wardrobes, to be opened only by its owner.  Inside the metal compartment

    <editdraft>The soft, tan sand gathers within white magically painted lines, serenely 
circling around three goal posts to form a pointed oval.  The goal posts 
rise over fifty feet from the ground where they abruptly halt to form the 
shape of a lone hoop perpendicular to the ground.  The soft tan mounds of 
sand are haphazardly arranged and compressed by hundreds of nine story falls 
of many a bludgeoned keeper.  There are the light crimson remnants among the 
sand that illustrate this brutal fact well.  To the south is the Quidditch 
Pitch Entrance.  To the Northwest is the Southwestern Baseline Section.  To 
the North is the South Centre Baseline Section.  To the Northeast is the 
Northeastern Baseline Section.

    <editdraftcomments>Hey guys, once again :) so ok, just a few tweaks on this room.  Also, let me 
just throw this in: you know you don't have to have the exits as the last 
sentences in your room.  You can put them in the middle if you want, or 
really anywhere.  It keeps things livened up if you switch it around a bit 
:) just a suggestion, not a command of course.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Your first echo here is lovely, but I think the second one needs to be 
changed to: &quot;A pink elephant rides a (Nimbus Two Thousand) through the 
centre Quidditch Goal, wearing a Prefect Badge, (its) great shining &quot;P&quot; 
glaring at the ground, followed by the distant sound of a Weasley's Wizard 
Wheezes Catherine Wheel whistling through the air.&quot;  However, I'm not sure I 
understand why a pink elephant is riding a broom.  Is the elephant a 
firecracker?  I'm a bit confused, lol.  And secondly, I DID edit your sand 
pit ed, but the other one was just dandy.  Written quite well, actually, I 
must say.  :) thanks so much!  `-mira

far above the quidditch pitch.  Scratches and dents coat the posts as 
fluidly as the rust paint imbued to their slender structures, the form of 
bludger impacts across the structure draw a brusque picture of violence, not

feels rough and gritty, hardly the stuff that would be expected to help a 
keeper survive a fall from eight stories.  As trod on it gives under the

hard as the grass around it.  The numerous sand piles are haphazardly 
shifted around in various forms, including one not far removed from the form 
of a person with a broom across their chest.  Something sticks out of the 
sand with a subtle difference from sand to object, near the protruding 
object is a small crimson spill, the mark of a recent bludger injury.

    <desc>. Bronze wardrobes line the western wall of the Ravenclaw Locker Room.  
Seven, bronze chairs - one for each team member - are scattered throughout 
the room.  The eastern wall is hidden behind a large, blue tarp that 
stretches from ceiling to floor.  The tarp has the faintest of scars on it 
in the shape of plays.  The ground is by far the most eye-catching aspect of 
the room; the base is one, large piece of grey stone, from which blue and 
bronze specks flash, as though coloured-stars were dancing across it.  The 
ceiling is a pure white and glows brightly, offering light to the place.  
The southern wall is adorned with many, moving photographs of previous 
captains accepting the Quidditch Cup.  A tiger-wood door leads southwest to 
an entrance to the Quidditch Pitch.  A heavy, blue drape leads north to the 
field.

    <editeds>The echo and ed are golden; I'm just adding a small change to the ed: instead of &quot;his wand&quot;, make it &quot;his or her&quot; wand, since the captain can be a girl. :D Also, If you sue my suggestion about tarpaulin in the desc, please change the tarp keyword to tarpaulin.

    <editfirstcomments>Hello!
I'm wondering what you mean by plays: what it players, or previous Quidditch matches?
 
Other than tha, I'm suggesting only small changes: the second &quot;tarp&quot; could become &quot;tarpaulin&quot;, and I think &quot;tiger-wood&quot; should be &quot;tigerwood&quot;.

    <editdraftcomments>Dear Surabhi, thank you so much for writing your first room! I love your reference here to Wordsworth; that's one of my favourite poems! There are, however, a few things I'd like you to pay particular attention to, as they need some change.
 
1) Whenever you mention grass, flowers, etc, please pay particular attention to the fact that grass and so on will not grow around here during the winter for example. Nor will the flowers. So either you tell us if there is an enchantment here that makes flowers keep blooming here, or you add &quot;seasonally&quot;, &quot;in season&quot;, &quot;in the warmer part of the year&quot;, etc to your sentences. it's an effective trick that Tina enforced a while ago - clever cookie that she is!
 
2) Please do not use &quot;you&quot; in your writing of descs or echoes. This is against Tina's 23 rules as stated in http://lumos.mugglenet.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=222915#222915 .
 
3) I do suggest that you try to give a bit of a feel in the room where we are. As the title of the room suggests, it's between the castle and the greenhouses, so I've added between brackets a sentence that should give the reader a bit of a clue where he/she is. Please feel free to rephrase anything that's between ()s in your own words. However, if you do change it to something else, please tell me about it.
 
4) You've done very, very well on the exits, Surabhi, on mentioning all of them and where they are. However, I've edited your southern exit, since it might be that this particular tunnel might be secret, so it would kind of give it away a little bit if we say that the entrance is to the south.
 
I love your writing and your atmosphere! Now it's just the details that need a bit of tweaking! Thank you so much for your hard work, and especially for mentioning Wordsworth. People don't give him as much credit as he deserves nowadays. Huggles, Cristina

    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1)I love your echoes; ooh, especially the ginger cat - precious, that! However, there are a few changes needed cuz of the &quot;you&quot; usage and the seasons. Also, please do not use phrases like &quot;elating your mood&quot;, which tells people how they should feel. Please try to write so that players can make up their own minds, lazy dolts that they are! :D
2)Please change echo number [0] to: 'A whiff of honeysuckle wafts by in a passing breeze.'
3)Please change echo number [1] to: &quot;A gentle breeze ripples through the air, persistent enough to ruffle loose clothes and any grass blades in its way.&quot;
4)Please change echo number [2] to: &quot;A ginger cat soundlessly passes by heading south, tail high in the air.&quot;
 
EDS:
 
Please rekey your ED by adding the keywords: flowers blooms blossoms. I've edited this ed for you - the point here was to actually give a more descriptive explanation of the flowers and what they look like. The text is between ()s, meaning you are free to rephrase it if you'd like to something more descriptive (and without &quot;you&quot;s), but if you do so, please let me know in a note. Huggles, Cristina

    <editfirst>An unpaved path lies here, cutting across a sea of seasonally lush-green 
grass; during the warmer part of the year, the lane is elegantly lined with 
delicate daffodils, the sway of which echoes the lines of William 
Wordsworth's &quot;The Daffodils&quot;.  (The light candour of the flowers makes this 
relatively cramped space seem larger, though it is squeezed between the 
eastern Hogwarts Castle and a western, glass-enclosed greenhouse.  The 
dark-green inhabitants of the translucent enclosure leer against the glass 
walls, following the shape of the transparent barrier to the northwest, 
where a back entrance lies.)  To the north, far behind a marble statue, the 
faint outline of forest trees (stretches across the horizon).  The unpaved 
lane leads further south, between the greenhouse and the castle.

      <desc>The pink and white daffodils stare innocently at the world around them.  
Effortlessly graceful, their colours deep and serene, the blossoms shiver 
and sway without the aid of winds; their inner petals are curled in an 
inverted bell, while the outer ones are fearlessly open towards the wide 
heavens.

    <desc>To the far west of the flower bed, a wide-open vegetable garden is seen.  It 
is surrounded by a few cherry trees.  Great varieties of fresh, vegetables 
grow here.  To the southeast of the patch are carrots having the redness of 
Betelgeuse.  Pink and yellow pumpkins, which can grow to twice the size of 
their Muggle relatives, are seen here.  Thick, tough creepers cover the 
mushy ground.  Moving northwest, blood-red tomatoes, leafy-green cabbages, 
lettuces, and turnips mushroom out of the earth.  The soil in this area is 
reddish-black.  The veggie patch extends widely to the north, east, west, 
and the northwest, while sloppy grounds stretch extensively towards the 
south and southwest.  The wide open grounds are to the southeast.

    <editdraftcomments>This is a lovely room, Surabhi! I've had little real edits to do here, and those which I did were mostly flow-related. I've seen that you wrote a lot of exits here, which is great! However, there were two more exits that needed adding, so I've done that myself. You will also find between brackets an addition which I suggest, but which you are free to rephrase in any way you'd like. I am assuming the hooked-nosed person is Snape, by the way, am I right? 
 
Other than that, just make sure you check the books for any term such as Butterbeer, so that you hit the correct spelling. Thank you so much for your work, and just so you know, I very much enjoyed this room! Hugs, Cristina

    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please change echo number [0] to: 'The pale, silvery ghost of a little girl with long pigtails skips around the hopscotch for a few seconds, then vanishes into thin air.'
 
2) Please change echo number [1] to: 'A small windstorm builds up just in front of the chalked figure four and follows the northeastern trail.'
 
ED:
 
1) Please change your ED keywords to: box six figure face drawing chalked picture wand nose portrait      .
 
2) I could edit your ed a little now, though not much is needed. However, I would really like you to try to give this ED a bit more texture. As it is, you are repeating the text that you already have about this subject in the main desc. Please add more details, such as: is this figure recognisable? Is it just the face, or is there also hair drawn around it? What's the expression on this person's face - is it shocked? outraged? angry? scared? let your lovely creativity flow into this one! Once you've edited this ed, please let me know, and I'll be back to check it. Hugs, Cristina

      <desc>The faded drawing shows a barely recognisable hook nosed face of a man, half 
erased by dirt.  The face is curtained by long, straight, lanky hair, right 
up to its slightly pointed chin.  The nose, invaded by a wand, almost falls 
out of the faces margin.  The expression on the visage seems shrewd yet 
irate.  Faint scribbling of words like jerk and slime ball can also be made 
out, over its forehead.

    <desc>Nate's room.  A small, well-trimmed hedge lies to the north with little pink 
and yellow buds scattered about it.  The green and refreshing grass appears 
to be freshly cut, and strewn with a couple of leaves from a tree to the 
west.  To the south, south-east, and south-west lies the path leading up to 
the school, while to the east is vague shape that could be an animal.  To 
the north-west there is hopscotch board and to the north-east is a clean cut 
lawn for relaxing in the sun on a clear afternoon.

    <editdraftcomments>Hey Nate, sweet room.  It's really cute.  Just a few things: Like the last 
note I sent you, the desc only goes into &quot;desc' after it has been edited.  
For now, it goes into &quot;view&quot; and &quot;draft&quot;.  Sentence 1: Please add a comma 
after &quot;small&quot;, to separate the adjectives.  Sentence 2: the wording of this 
makes it seem as though the grass were cut with the leaves.  Add a comma 
after &quot;cut&quot; and add &quot;and strewn&quot;.  Also, it reads more smoothly if you 
remove &quot;and&quot; from between &quot;green and refreshing&quot;, and just replace it with a 
comma.  However, this is a suggestion and you don't have to if you'd rather 
it stayed.  Sentence 3: Add a comma after &quot;school&quot;.  Sentence 4: 
&quot;north-east&quot; should be hyphenated.  Remove either &quot;while&quot; or &quot;and&quot; from this 
sentence, as you do not need both of them.  If you leave &quot;while&quot;, add a 
comma after &quot;board&quot;.  You didn't add all the exits, either.  The players 
won't be able to see them like we can, so you have to make sure to write 
them in.  Even something simple like, &quot;The grounds reach out in every 
direction from this patch of land.&quot;  Is sufficient.  J This was a good room. 
 Nice idea!  Xoxo Jess 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Your echoes say essentially the same thing.  Please remove one of them, or 
change it to something different.  J Your EDs are really good, only one 
thing to change: ED2, you can not say &quot;other side&quot;.  Be specific, use the 
direction of the trail.  Otherwise, awesome job!

The upper portion of the plants can be seen.  To the north, cucumbers 
nurture under the protective covering of Mother Nature.  The fertile soil 
provides good nutrition to the vegetables.  Maroon-coloured beetroots 
mushroom to the east.  In between them is a partition made by pebbles.  On 
the other side of the field, peanuts are sown deep underground.  Centrally 
placed is a scarecrow, stuffed with hay and covered in patched clothes.  The

extensive grounds lie to the south, west, southeast, and the southwest.

    <desc>when writing this make sure to put in the desc that the grounds slope here
 
chris/monncrief is working here
</desc>
    <editdraft>The land here is dominated by a meadow covered in tall, waving grasses.  The 
light green myriad blend of grasses is dotted with small patches of yellow 
wheat that tower over the other plant life native to this meadow.  
Wildflowers also accent the landscape in shades of purple, red, blue, and 
yellow.  Underneath the vegetation, the ground is somewhat hard and dry, 
with small cracks running through it.  A butterbeer container has been 
tossed carelessly nearby, and there is a small, dark hole in the ground.  
The meadow rolls down in a gentle slope south.  A garden is flourishing to 
the north, while rocky land is visible to the south.  The east is occupied 
by several small stepping-stones, and the sloping ground continues to the 
west.

    <editdraftcomments>I don't see anything wrong with your desc, so go ahead and just slap this 
baby in!  Nice work.

    <desc>An ash tree grows, slim and straight, in the centre of this gently-sloped 
area.  Lush, green grass dotted with wildflowers, covers the rich earth in 
season.  Ringing the base of the ash trunk is a small flowerbed edged with 
roofing tiles to hold back the encroaching grass and protect the friable, 
black earth from erosion.  Small, woody bushes interspersed with 
constantly-shifting, weedy plants take advantage of the well-worked soil.  
Hogwarts itself is visible to the east, up the gentle hill.  The castle 
grounds spread in all directions.  The Quidditch Pitch can be spotted in the 
southwest, and, far to the north, the fringes of the Forbidden Forest loom 
against the sky.

      <desc>These gnarled shrubs, no more than a foot high, have shaggy, dull, brown 
bark and tiny, oval leaves.  The fleshy leaves are a dark, matte green on 
top, but a pale grey-green on the underside.  Even in the depths of winter, 
these miniscule snippets of green remain.  Minute, lavender flowers cluster 
on the ends of each branch in the summer's heat, diffusing the astringently 
aromatic aroma of the plant more strongly.

      <desc>These spindly stems are home to long, grass-green leaves most of the year, 
with the addition of miniscule, five-lobed, purple flowers in spring.  In 
the winter, they die back to brownish, twiggy lace.  At any season, the 
plants seem to shift and blur in constant flux, without ever seeming to 
move.  Delicate flowers, fuzzy leaves, and flexible stems all exude a 
strongly medicinal aroma, vaguely reminiscent of mint and eucalyptus in 
roughly equal proportions.

    <desc>The rocky ground underfoot connects a stone drive to the south and the vast 
expanse of a meadow in the north.  Fragments of rock, of various shapes and 
sizes, lie scattered everywhere here, peeking from cuts in the scarred 
earth.  The largest, misshapen stone is just about three feet tall, its base 
deeply buried in the earth.  Ragged and oblivious to its unfinished state, 
the rock barely outlines a house elf, as though someone had tried to carve 
out something meaningful from the rock, but left it undone.  Pebbles are 
littered at the feet of this rather simplistic bit of art, trailing a path 
to the south, southeast and southwest, where a grand driveway leads from the 
Hogwarts outer gates to the castle.  The ground slopes north, northwest, and 
northeast, tracing the gentle contours of the grounds.  Caught between an 
eastern ash tree and western topiaries, this grey expanse seems out of place 
and harsh.

    <editdraftcomments>Dear Surabhi, you have a great gift for describing places, and I like the way you include just a little bit of background in your rooms, to make it spicy and atmospheric. I believe your rooms have a great potential of becoming absolutely stunning. However, as in the previous rooms, I have edited out all the &quot;you&quot;s, as we are writing in third person. If you want to take another look at our rules, please check - http://lumos.mugglenet.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=222915#222915 . I've taken the liberty to suggest some rephrasing in some parts. This is not because your writing is wrong in any way, but because I think that sometimes it lacks a bit of fluency. For example: &quot;Many parts of the rock below peek out from the ground.&quot; This sounds as though you had grass, and some dirt was showing, but I do think this is supposed to be more like, barren ground. Also, your passing from the elf rock to the exits is a bit rough, so I tried to smooth it a bit.
Finally, you only had a few exits here, so I added the rest and cropped them in groups a little bit. I do recommend that if you have the time you take a look at some of the rooms in the driveway that is just south of your room. Those are some examples of rooms that use third person and that sound, at least I hope they do, as awesome as rooms written in second person. They also show you a few tricks of how to avoid repetitions etc. Well done here, especially on your house-elf rock. It's a very good idea! Huggles, Cristina
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES: 1.  Please change echo number [0] to: &quot;A glint flashes off the 
elf-shaped rock, only to disappear a moment later.&quot;  2.  Please change echo 
number [2] to: &quot;Sudden, cautious whispers fill the air for a moment, 
stopping as abruptly as they began.&quot;  EDS: I've edited your ed of &quot;elf&quot;.  
There are two comments I'd like to make here, though: 1) You have lovely 
details here, but not so much description of the actual rock.  I've 
suggested a manner of rephrasing it, though you are free to change that and 
send me a note so I can come back and see.  I've tried to include all your 
sweet details in it, too!  2) Please do not use automatic translators to 
translate texts into languages you do not have a good control of to begin 
with.  A consequence of that is that when you've told it to translate: 
&quot;lies&quot; (my honour), it actually translated it to &quot;falsehoods&quot; (my honour).  
Though I am an editor, I first asked the advice of the local French genius 
before continuing.  She made the excellent point that usually French 
students would NOT get into Hogwarts, but in Beauxbatons (hope I spelled 
that right).  Also, she indicated a quote in the movie: Bicentennial man, 
which we've somewhat changed from: &quot;One is glad to be of service&quot; to &quot;One is 
honoured to be of service&quot;.  If you absolutely insist that it be in French, 
you can also chat to Carole/Noon and she will advise you on the wording.  
Thank you so much for you hard work, girl, and keep this up!  Hugs, Cristina

    <desc>A rather large, creamy-white boulder sprouts here from a grassy, gentle 
slope; the northern side of the rock is worn down into a comfortable seat.  
Grass covers this entire hillside during the warmer part of the year, though 
as is progresses southward, the verdant green changes to a lively red that 
matches the sand it grows in.  Around the base of the stone grow spindly 
plants that resemble weeds, their tiny flowers the colour of a sunset hidden 
by mossy green leaves.  Down the southern slope rises a statue; uphill, to 
the north and northeast, lie vegetable gardens.  To the west of the hillock 
grow thickets of trees, towering above flowering plants no greater than one 
foot in height.  Dotting the hillside are several small, fist-sized holes, 
surrounded by rings of loose soil; these are probably the entrances to the 
burrows of rabbits and other small rodents.

    <editeds>Oooh, lovely, lovely details you have here. I love those flowers! However, here are some suggestions:
 
ECHOES:
 
1. Please change echo number 0 to: 'Carried along a gentle breeze, a tropical scent fills the air, swirling away just as suddenly as it appeared.' You can use the command delecho &lt;echo number&gt; to delete the original echo once you've changed this one.
 
EDS:
 
1. I've edited all your eds, so please have a look at them and gimme a shout if you think something's not right.
 
2. You have the keyword 'flowers' in two eds. If the players type look flowers though, only one of these will come up. Please therefore remove the 'flowers' keywords from your 'weeds' ed. You can do this by using the command: ed rekey &lt;one old keyword&gt; &lt;all the new keywords&gt;.
 
Thank you for the hard work, and well, well done! `-Cristina

    <editfirstcomments>Lovely Brad, you have great imagery and know how to perfectly put it into play! I am very, very impressed. I did, however, tweak your room somewhat, and I'd like to go through the more important points with you:
 
1. Firstly, I suggest possibly using a British English spellcheck in your rooms. You don't have a lot of 'Americanisms', but there is the occasional 'color' instead of 'colour' and suchlike. I know it can be tricky at first, but a British spellcheck would help.
 
2. Secondly, you have grass and plants here. This is a tricky bit, because grass and flowers only bloom during the warmer part of the year. This was a major pain for us until Tina came up with a solution. So here's the trick: say that the trees, plants, flowers only grow 'During the warmer part of the year', 'Seasonally', or 'In season'. That takes care of the problem.
 
3. You have great detail here, but it's a bit scattered, so it turns the attention of the players somewhat chaotically from one side to the other. I've tried to group together some bits and pieces of sentence which can be linked together.
 
4. I do absolutely love the feeling of this room. I am also a kind of writer that tries to convey the feeling of actually being in the room, rather than seeing it, and you're doing that brilliantly here.
 
Take a look at the edits and do not hesitate to thump me if you think I am wrong or too harsh. `-Cristina

      <desc>Springing out of the grassy slope, this creamy-white boulder emanates a 
sense of peace and relaxation.  Streaks of pale yellow and orange run along 
the surface of the stone, contrasting with its otherwise milky-white, smooth 
texture.  Facing north, a depression is carved into the stone, worn in by 
years of students using it as a bench.  The larger, southern part of the 
boulder reaches six feet in height and hangs above the downward, hill slope. 
 Although mostly smooth, the stone is coarser along its upper part, probably 
as a result of a misfired spell.  [to be made into obj]

      <desc>With startling hues of yellow, orange, and a slight smattering of scarlet, 
these tiny flowers seem very misplaced growing on dull, depressing weeds.  
The blooms emit an aura of fierceness and passion, of fiery tempers and 
burning courage.  When touched, they give one the feeling of having one's 
hand in a pot of boiling water.  A few of the flowers are closed up in tiny 
balls resembling warm-coloured blueberries, while the others are fully open. 
 Thin, almost invisible streams of red pollen float from the open blossoms, 
carrying with them a scent reminiscent of exotic, tropical locations.

      <desc>. Growing at the base of the large boulder, these plants are dull in 
comparison to the piece of lightly-coloured rock.  Occasional shadows cast 
by the massive stone make the already-depressing, mossy greens of the 
foliage look even darker than they regularly are.  Rather large, squared 
leaves make up most of the plant, originating on a stout and pointed stem.  
Tiny, nearly invisible thorns grow all around the foliage, sturdy and 
wickedly sharp.  At the base of the leaves, right were they branch off of 
the stems, tiny, blueberry-shaped flowers grow almost completely hidden by 
the expanding, dark green, their sunset hues a startling contrast to the 
drab shades of the rest of the weed.  [to be made into obj]

    <desc>when writing this make sure to put in the desc that the grounds slope here
Petra's working here.
</desc>
    <editdraft>The ground slopes here in a low, rolling hill.  When the sun sheds warm and 
temperate rays, this declivity is covered by minute flowers, levelling with 
the grass' rich, deep carpet.  The blossoms are in shades of blue, ranging 
from dark navy to pale Alice blue, stretching in a wide gradient over the 
hillock like a warm, summer sky.  Each has four pointed petals around a 
yellow centre, reaching to the sky from their fragile stems.  Standing to 
the west and southwest are great statues of magical beasts.  Shrubs and 
gardens lie to the south, northeast, and southeast as the grounds spread out 
in all other directions.

    <editdraftcomments>Petra, I really like the vividness of this room!  And I just love flowers 
too :) first note, like in the last room I mentioned, please put First Draft 
at the beginning of the room name so we can tell which are written more 
easily.  I changed the beginning of your second sentence to make it more 
clear and less redundant, since you already said these flowers were minute, 
saying again that they were tiny was just repeating yourself.  The rest 
looked pretty good to me, just a few tweaks as always.  Keep up the great 
work!  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Your echoes are lovely, but please change the 4 am to about 6-7 am, as that way we're covered for all seasons. Otherwise, this is golden. `-Cristina

    <editfirst>The ground slopes here in a low, rolling hill covered by minute flowers, 
(leveling) with the rich grass' deep carpet.  (The blossoms are in) shades 
of blue, (ranging) from navy to (the) palest white, stretching in a wide 
gradient over the (hill) like a warm, summer sky.  Each (has) four pointed 
petals around a yellow centre, (reaching) to the sky from their fragile 
stems.  Standing to the west and southwest are great statues of magical 
beasts.  Shrubs and gardens lie to the south, northeast, and southeast, and 
the grounds spread out in all other directions.  
</editfirst>
    <editfirstcomments>Okay, I'm here again.  =)  I changed the 1st sentence in order to add the stuff in the 2nd sentence.  I need to stress this, these descs (at the moment at least) cover ALL temperatures and ALL times of the year.  You have to either avoid ANY mention of season-specific details, or note that it's a seasonal desc.  I put in a descriptive way of saying 'spring and summer' without the typical 2 phrases we usually say, e.g. 'when in season', etc.  I used declivity instead of hill again to not sound redundant and I changed 'leveling' to the British 'levelling'.  (British English isn't as lazy as our Americanized version- they almost always use 2 Ls instead of 1.)  And easy way to check this is to go to dictionary.com and type in the word.  It will let you know if it's chiefly British or 
American.  I also changed 'rich grass' deep carpet' to 'grass' rich, deep carpet'.  The carpet is the grass.  Rich grass' deep carpet is awkward and clumsy, so I rearranged the word order so that it flows like the grounds.  In sentence 3 I changed palest white to Alice blue since you state earlier in the sentence that the flowers are in shades of BLUE.  I chose the palest blue color.  This may help: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Shades_of_blue -wikipedia has shades of all colors.  I also changed Mira's 'hill' to 'hillock' since hill is mentioned once before in this desc.  Pet, good job in trying to shake things up word-wise.
I altered the last sentence by one word since all descs tend to have 'and the' so much in exiting-ridden rooms.  That be all that I'sa have.  `-tina

</editsecond>
    <editsecondcomments>I think most of the commentary was excellently done by Tina already, so I am not even going to presume to explain things as well as she did. I only added 'bloom' after 'each' in sentence four, as the last noun you were speaking of was a hillock. I've also added a comma and replaced 'as the grounds' by 'while Hogwarts Grounds', since I thought it was more precise. I hope you agree with these comments, and I think both you and your work are very pretty. `-Cristina

    <desc>Short, neatly-trimmed, seasonal grass grows in a beautiful shade of emerald 
green here - probably a consequence of magic.  Above the grass rise several 
bushes, their shapes alternating between round and spiral.  The round ones 
follow the contour of a three-quarter-sphere, while the spiral ones are 
trimmed into a winding staircase that starts thick at the bottom, and 
finishes as an elegant spike.  The thicket is a deep shade of green and 
stands approximately two feet from the ground.  During warm seasons, small, 
red flowers known as pimpernels grow scattered across the grass.  Their 
colour is a prefect complementary shade to the emerald carpet around them, 
as exquisite as though painted by an extraordinarily-talented artist.  The 
topiaries look upon a sweeping drive that extends to the south, southwest, 
and southeast, with grounds extending in all other cardinal directions.

    <editdraft>Short, neatly-trimmed grass grows here in a beautiful shade of emerald green 
- probably a doing of magic.  Above the grass, several bushes grow, their 
shapes alternating between round and spiral.  The round ones are shaped like 
three quarters of a sphere, and the spiral ones are trimmed into a beautiful 
spiral that starts thick at the bottom, and finishes as an elegant spike.  
These bushes are a deep shade of green, and rise approximately two feet from 
the ground.  During warm seasons, small, red flowers known as pimpernels 
grow scattered across the grass.  Their colour is a prefect complementary 
shade to the colour of the grass, thus making nature one wonderful artist.  
This topiary looks upon the sweeping drive that extends southwards, while 
two fountains, two meadows, and some rock outcroppings surround it.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Dear Kristina, I've edited your draft a bit here. Mostly, I've tried to eliminate the repetitions and to make the sentences flow naturally. As a more major comment: it is confusing for a reader to step in here and read that sudden list of exits at the end. I know it can be awkward to write them, but I've given you a suggestion of a rephrase there that might make it less confusing. Otherwise, a very good room, Kristina! `-Cristina
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please change 'across the topiary' in your echo number [0] to 'across the area', since I don't think the scent will be reduced to just the bushes.
 
2) Echo number [1] is a little bit muddled. Let's clear it to: 'One of the spiral bushes suddenly springs to life. Serpent shaped, it swirls on the spot, its deep-yellow eyes flashing. One moment later, it is a bush again.'
 
EDs:
 
For your pimpernel ed, I have suggested a small rewrite. The reason is that your version gives only a bit of information on what the flower looks like, and as I looked up the pimpernel, I noticed that its probably most fascinating feat is that it just closes and opens depending on the weather. Please feel free to rephrase again if you disagree with my rewrite, and to address me any further questions if you think I did anything wrong. Huggles, Cristina

      <desc>These beautiful flowers have a strong radial symmetry, with five scarlet 
petals.  The stems are stalk-like and decorated with egg-shaped leaves that 
always appear in pairs.  Demanding and pretentious, each blossom chooses a 
different stem to appear on.  The petals are caught in a ring towards the 
centre, their colour fading inwards to a bright pink that contrasts with the 
petite, green, spiky leaves that grow in between.  The Muggle species of 
pimpernel is already a very sensitive flower, which closes before the threat 
of rain or from too much sun; this particular subspecies, however, has even 
taken to closing when boys are around, exploding to their full splendour 
only before a maiden's eyes.

    <editdraftcomments>Though I have no corrections, I do have a question about your last sentence. 
 The &quot;from scarves to past teams&quot; doesn't make sense to me, as it would seem 
that players are hanging from the wall?  If you get what I mean.  I think 
what you mean to say is like, there are tokens there, and some are even of 
old/past teams.  So maybe it could say: fans have placed all sorts of items, 
even ones from past teams, around this entrance, virtually covering it in 
anything from scarves to (insert other object here).  What do you girls 
think?  If I'm silly, just leave it be, otherwise maybe it could fixed.  And 
there's no need to write back for me to check it, I trust you guys.  :)

    <desc>Tanned, brown bushes block the southwest corner of this path, their faded 
colour perhaps the result of too little watering or too harsh an exposure to 
the elements.  Towering to the west, the grand entrance to the Quidditch 
Pitch makes a startling contrast of sandstone with seasonal grass.  In the 
exact centre of the patch is a huge, stone statue on a pedestal, 
representing a young wizard dressed in Quidditch robes.  Around the 
platform, minute, white daisies sprout seasonally from every space 
available.  Trails to the south, southeast, and east lead to extensive rows 
of flower beds.  In all other cardinal directions, hidden lanes vanish into 
the overgrowth.

    <editdraft>Sun-baked bushes block the southwest corner of this path.  In the exact 
centre is a huge stone statue on a pedestal, of a young wizard dressed in 
Quidditch robes.  Around the pedestal minute white lilies sprout from every 
space available.  In the east the high entrance of the Quidditch pitch 
stands proudly.  Trails to the south, southeast, and east lead to extensive 
rows of flower beds.  Rest of the trails disappear into various other places 
within the grounds.

    <editdraftcomments>Dearest Surabhi, this is a lovely patch here! I do, however have a few edits to make. 
 
Firstly, you have there that the bushes are sun-baked. As that gives an indirect implication of the weather I've changed that to &quot;Tanned, brown bushes&quot;. 
 
I've also rearranged the text around a bit so that the first sentence (which contains information about the edges of the path) can be continued with something else that regards the edges of the path. Since I've added a bit more to the flavour of this sentence, it's placed between parantheses - the idea is that you can either accept my suggestion or change the sentence a bit to that effect. 
 
A very important thing: you have white lilies in this patch. Now I've actually researched them and white lilies are only native to the Balkans and to West Asia, therefore NOT to Scotland. These plants need a temperate, warm climate, which Scotland (and England) doesn't have. I know it's tricky to find flowers that are both pretty and resistant to the cold; however, these are the two solutions: 1) you change the flowers, for example to daisies; 2) you make a magical environment around this growth, which preserves the lilies even in bad condition. I've put that sentence in parantheses too, so you can change it.
 
I've also rephrasd the end of the desc, so that it accounts for all the other exits not mentioned in the text.
 
Please don't be discouraged by my comments. You've got the basics of room writing well under your control; the things I am editing here are only meant to enrich your writing and keep it up to our very, very high standards. Hugs, well done and thank you for writing! Cristina
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Echo number 1 is a tad bit too long. I would suggest rephrasing it to: 'A lanky house-elf emerges from the south, hunched under the weight of a bag far bigger then itself; grumbling, he staggers off to the northwest.'
 
2) Though the word &quot;shit&quot; is quite literal here, I would prefer it if we used softer words for it. Please rephrase echo number 2 with: 'A crow flies past, delivering greenish-white excrement to the ground. The projectile narrowly misses the statue and its pedestal.'
 
EDS:
 
I've edited your ed. Please have a look when you have the chance. I have put in a name for the Quidditch Player - you'd left it blank. Inauspicus means unlucky in Latin, and I figured Trobble would be a nice rewording of Trouble. :D Feel free, however, to change the name. Hugs, Cristina

      <desc>The young, stone wizard in this statue smiles an extravagant smile, his eyes 
looking far to the west.  He sports long, flowing hair reaching his broad 
shoulders, and his body is rather bulky.  His right hand rests on his hips, 
while the top end of a broom supports his left arm.  The sculpture stands 
with its legs crossed over the square pedestal; on the western face of this 
platform is a shiny, black-marble slab, on which an inscription is carved.  
The writing states, &quot;In grief-stricken memory of Inauspicus Trobble - 
Quidditch all-rounder of the year 1588, who died when a fellow Beaters club 
accidentally hit his head, damaging it beyond repair.&quot;

    <editdraftcomments>Hey surabhi :) overall this was an ok room.  There were some comma mistakes 
that were thrown in and unnecessary.  It helps if you read your paragraph 
outloud, and when you naturally pause to take a breath, that's usually when 
a comma is needed.  Of course it's not always the case ;) but when in doubt, 
leave it out!  Is a nice rule to follow 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Everything is just lovely here except for in echo #1, there needs to be a 
comma after bush.  When you have 3 items, a comma needs to be placed before 
that last and ;) if you have any other concerns, please speak up!  `-mira

      <desc>The low bush is the darkest colour of green. It has little flowers studded like pearls on it. The flowers shine gaily even in the dimmest light, altogether making the bush look like a tiara. The only backdrop of this lonesome ornament is a small lizard hiding between two of the white flowers, with only its nose jutting out in view.

    <editfirst>Through the Quidditch Pitch wall that forms the western border of this patch 
of ground, an opening leads into the stadium itself.  A path runs from this 
entrance to a cage in the middle of the patch, whence six more lanes 
radiates to the north, northeast, east, southeast, south, and southwest.  
All these trails are little more than barer spots on a mostly-bare soil.  In 
the cage is the statue of a four-legged figure, restlessly pacing and 
looking around.  To the east, richer-looking grounds can be glimpsed, 
especially the flower beds.  To the south stands the outer wall and far 
morth the castle is faintly visible.

    <editsecondcomments>The alterations that I have made to the texture of this room involve the Quidditch Pitch. I would recommend reading this thread, since we've made a 'standard' for the appearance of the Pitch: http://lumos.mugglenet.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6504 . 
 
Other than that, the room had good content, but it sounded a bit forced, so I tried to rephrase some things here. If you disagree with any of the changes, please tell me about it and change it any way you wish. Then I can take a second look at the room. `-Cristina

      <desc>The cage is a simple, though tough, assemblage of dark, metal wires, topped 
with a little dome.  On the northern side, one of the bars bears a symbol, 
like a 'V' and an 'S' linked together by cursive writing.  Below that, 
written vertically, are the words &quot;Capricorn - That which has horns like a

the aureate, lion-like head suggests that this is a female.  Above the 
deep-brown eyes, two minuscule, black horns can thus poked amidst the very 
short fur.  The golden-coloured head smoothly blends onto a goat's body of a 
similar, honey-like tinge, covered in wavy, rather than smooth hair.  The 
statue's cloven hooves are the colour of molten gold; a tail covered in 
similarly-hued scales expands from the body, ending in sharp, 
dangerous-looking spikes.

darker and more opaque; also, not a blade of grass grows there.  A thin 
layer of buff dust puffs up with every step.

    <desc>Against the foot of the Quidditch Pitch's southwestern angle leans a group 
of four statues: a Valkyrie pointing her spear to the north, a samurai 
looking sternly into the east, an Amazon facing south, and an Aztec warrior 
turned to the west.  From their feet slither seven paths through the gentle, 
short-cropped, flower-speckled grass.  To the northeast, east, southeast, 
south, and southwest, series of stepstones lead to the very nearby Hogwarts 
Outer Wall.  To the north, a dirt trail follows along the Quidditch Pitch's 
tall, long fence towards the general direction of the Hogwarts Gates; to the 
west, a similar lane runs along it towards the far Flower Beds and further 
away to the Lake.

      <desc>This statue represents a shieldmaiden.  She is wearing a small, round, 
dull-silver helmet with a coppery-gold rim and two bands that cross on top 
of her head in the same colour.  The helmet helps discipline her long mane, 
keeping it from her hard eyes, angular cheekbones, and square jaw.  A raven 
sinks his talons in the dull-silver chainmail moulding her torso, hips, and 
thighs.  A slit on the external side of each thigh allows greater freedom of 
movement, while a leather belt prevents the metal tunic from turning 
inappropriately.  The belt also holds a sword in a leather and copper 
scabbard.  In her right hand is a long spear pointing north, and on her left 
is strapped a round, dull-silver, and coppery-gold shield.  A large wolf is 
snarling besides her.

prolonged on the arms by sleeves and gauntlets.  The thighs are covered by a 
short skirt and by a slightly longer underskirt; the legs are encased in 
greaves and the feet bear some more protection, as well as wooden sandals.  
A long, slightly-curved, one-edged sword is in his right hand and a short 
dagger in his left, both pointing east.

Through a slit up to the hip, a small dagger can be seen attached to her 
right thigh, while her right hand lightly rests on her horse's encolure.

arms, two large bracelets of gold and turquoise frame his biceps.  His right 
hand holds a spear aloft, pointing it west; a small snake is coiled loosely 
around his wrist, staring into the west.  The left arm bears a very adorned, 
feathered shield representing the Feathered Serpent, Quetzalcoatl.

      <desc>The two dirt paths are littered with small, treacherous, sharp lime-stones, 
while more, larger lime-stones have been smoothed and aligned into 
stepstones.  The whitish stones contrast sharply with the dark soil.  The 
latter is soft enough for many a footprint to have been carved into it.

      <desc>The grass bears evidence of many a trampling and a shortcut between paths.  
Oddly, the flowers are completely unaffected, even when they rear up from 
obvious footprints: their stems stand proudly upright, their delicate petals 
are unblemished, the serrated leaves wave serenely in the occasional breeze.

heavens, giving protection from the close by Quidditch pitch.  Protected 
from elements, a magically mounted portrait hangs upon the wall giving 
highlights of the Quidditch game.  Through out the well-travelled area, 
patches of dirt and rock cover the nearly non-existent grass.  Opposite the 
wall, a large lamppost stands giving light to the area for evening Quidditch 
games.  The vast beige wall continues to the north and south while a large 
marshy patch lies a short distance to the northeast.  Littering the ground 
to the southwest, small plums rest upon the earth from the vibrant and 
flourishing plum grove; surely a tasty treat for tired Quidditch spectators

plums, hehe.  They say dr.  Pepper has prune juice in it :P wonder if that's 
true...

      <desc>Standing ten feet tall and thoroughly embedded in the ground, a large black 
lamppost shines throughout the night.  As if controlled by magic, the 
pleasantly warm light ceases to exist come sunrise and begins with the 
presence of sun down.  Small lines of rubber markings streak the base of the 
pole, almost certainly from attempts made by students to climb the rotund 
pole.

the greenhouses.  Red sand litters the ground, except for some meagre, 
yellowing tufts of grass.  (The sand-covered earth is soft and rises in a 
gentle slope that runs southward.)  Eight paths run out in every direction, 
each covered in golden pebbles.  In fact, between the background colours and 
golden statue of a Griffin pacing in the centre, this patch looks very 
Gryffindoresque.

    <editdraftcomments>Made just tiny adjustments here for you :) also, this is only 3 sentences

know you can do it!  You have a brilliant mind, and I'm sure you can come up 
with something great.

a giant eagle.  Its thick, stone plumage meets the fur-covered, hind body of 
a lion in a sharp contrast.  Between the merciless, avian talons and lethal, 
leonine claws, the beast is as dangerous as it is noble.

    <desc>At the crest of a hill here, the branches of a fir tree shade a wide area 
where no grass grows.  Instead, a deep blanket of brown needles spreads out 
from the trunk of the tree to the outer reaches of the branches.  An 
occasional pine cone pokes its head upward, out of the cover.  The fir 
itself is not extraordinary, aside from its immense height and width.  Its 
topmost branches seem to scrape the sky, while its arms spread in a span of 
several feet.  The hillock's slope is gentle and can be climbed down from 
all cardinal directions.

    <desc>This patch of grass lies in the southeastern corner of the Quidditch Pitch.  
To the east, flashes of colours, scented gusts of wind, and echoes of 
buzzing insects announce the presence of some flower beds.  To the south 
looms over the close, impressive height of the Hogwarts outer wall, while 
the faraway castle is little more than a grey, massive line on the horizon.  
In the centre of this patch of grass stands the statue of a centaur.  From 
it radiate eight straight paths in every direction, including the northwest, 
even though the way is blocked by the Quidditch Pitch corner.  Strangely 
enough, the paths are all marked with a white arrow pointing outward.

      <desc>The male centaur statue is finely carved out of a light-gray stone, each 
muscle perfectly outlined, each feature precisely cut out.  His long hair 
pooled around his smooth, masculine face and onto his shoulder as he gazes 
intently skyward.  A bow hangs loosely in his left hand, while the right one 
is playing idly with an arrow.  In the nude, as most centaurs prefer to go, 
he is only wearing a quiver of arrows slung over his back.  On said quiver 
is engraved a sign, representing an oblique arrow crossed by a plain line; 
beneath are written the words &quot;Sagittarius, the Archer&quot;.

      <desc>Through the tall, luxurious, green grass, the two-foot-wide paths run 
straight from the statue to their destinations, no bend allowed.  About 
halfway out of the patch, a white arrow is drawn neatly on the dark-brown 
earth; the body is a foot wide, the foot-and-a-half-long head is pointing 
away from the statue.  Each arrow bears a different writing: on the northern 
one is written &quot;Entrance to Hogwarts Castle&quot;, the northeastern one orients 
to the &quot;Southern part of the castle&quot;, and pointing eastward is the 
inscription &quot;Flower Beds&quot;.  Then, the four arrows spanning from southeast to 
west signal the outer wall and spell, respectively:&quot;Outer wall&quot;, &quot;More of 
outer wall&quot;, &quot;Even more of the outer wall&quot;, and &quot;Definitely more of the 
outer wall&quot;.  Finally the northwestern arrow announces &quot;Duh!  The Quidditch 
Pitch, can't you see?&quot;

    <desc>Seven magnificent, dirty-white aspen trees tower over the view here, 
reaching up, towards the sky.  Their rough, whitish bark sports various 
shades of grey and black where it has been chipped or cut off.  A group of 
young aspens grows huddled together nearby, appearing weak and fragile 
alongside the slender giants.  Soft, steady pillows of moss rest between the 
trees, occasionally broken by patches of short grass.  A thin trail leads 
through the grove, carved by the feet of enthusiastic admirers; during 
autumn, the trees enshroud themselves in lovely orange and red, in a serene 
heaven-on-earth.  Even outside the seasonal glory of autumn, this site 
offers an eternal, magical shelter from the sun, a mellow tune rustled by 
the trees, and the softest of beds in the green moss.  In its breathtaking 
beauty, the patch casts a shadow on four statues that stand southeast, 
southwest, east, and south, while the gigantic Hogwarts Wall rises to the 
west.  In all other directions spread the rest of the grounds.

    <editdraft>Seven magnificent, dirty white bodies of aspen trees tower the view up 
towards the sky.  The rough whitish bark sports various shades of grey and 
black, at places where it has been chipped, or cut off.  Nearby, a group of 
young aspens grows huddled together, appearing so weak and fragile alongside 
these slender giants.  Soft, steady pillows of moss rest among the bases of 
the trees, occasionally broken by patches of short grass.  A thin trail 
leads through the grove, probably a proof of beauty that resides here during 
the autumn, when the trees enshroud themselves in beautiful orange and red 
colors, and turn this place in a serene heaven on earth.  Students from the 
castle often visit this site, where an eternal shade shelters from the sun, 
the trees rustle a mellow tune, and the green moss offers the softest of 
beds.  This breathtaking patch casts a shadow on four statues that stand 
southwards and to the east, while the gigantic Hogwarts Wall rises to the 
west, and the rest of the grounds spread northwards.

    <editdraftcomments>Dearest Kristina, not many comments from me this time. One more important matter: in your exits you have &quot;southward&quot; to represent: south, southwest, and southeast. That will confuse the players, as they will think you meant only south. Other than that, this patch is lovely; all I've done is tweak a bit where I thought the sentences were a bit muddled, and I rephrased your &quot;proof of beauty&quot; sentence. Please feel free to rephrase it in your own terms though! Well, well done here, Kristina. I loved the atmosphere and the gigantic, shady aspens. Hugs, Cristina

    <desc>The greenhouses are outlined to the north of this area, while at the 
southern border lies the sweeping drive that runs from the Hogwarts Gates to 
the castle.  A western, outer wall looms close-by.  This patch is covered in 
yellowed grass, with eight, beige, dirt paths scuttling away in every 
direction.  Even the earth visible between tufts of grass is a light, buff 
hue.  Amidst their overwhelming, golden-brown surroundings, squandered, dark 
pebbles echo the intense black of a centrally-placed Niffler statue that 
rises where the eight lanes meet.

    <editdraft>The Greenhouses are outlined to the north while to the southern border lies 
the sweeping drive, running to the Hogwarts Castle.  The western outer wall 
looms close-by.  This patch is covered in yellowed grass with eight beige, 
dirt paths scuttling away in every direction.  Even the earth visible 
between tufts of grass of a light buff hue.  Only two things break this 
overall colouring: black pebbles are squandered here and there.  And the 
black statue of a Niffler stands in the middle of the area, where the lanes 
meet.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Oooh, a niffler!  How fun!  :D again here, you've met the length 
requirement, but I would really enjoy some more inspiring writing from you!  
*chants, I WANT MORE AWESOME WRITING FROM CAROLE!  I WANT MORE AWESOME 
WRITING FROM CAROLE!  * lol.  Puh-leeeeeeeease?  :) hehe.  Anyway, the only 
thing I think I did was capitalize 2 words, and I think I threw in 1 comma.  
That's all :) 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please change echo number 0 to 'The sculpted Niffler looks around somewhat hopefully(, its move completely soundless).' The part between brackets is at your discretion to add or leave out.
 
2) Please change echo number 3 to: 'The stone Niffler sniffs the air.'
 
EDS:
 
I've edited your ed somewhat. I also changed the 'rough' fur that you have on it to 'fluffy' fur, as that is how the Nifflers are described in Harry Potter and the goblet of Fire, page 471 (of the British Edition). Please take a look when you have the time. 
 
Please also add sculpture, figure, and black to the ED's keywords
 
Otherwise, I love the level of detail of your statues, as ever. `-Cristina

</editsecond>
    <editsecondcomments>The main changes I've made to the desc are trying to give a bit more detail to someone who doesn't know the grounds as we do, so who, for instance, has no idea what driveway that is, or where the heck they are. You also have a slight cohesion problem in the sentence where you mention TWO things standing out and you only have ONE thing, the pebbles, actually mentioned in the same sentence. I know your Niffler statue was the other thing, but it sounds a little bit confusing. So here we go. The way I've rephrased that last sentence is entirely up to you to keep or to throw away, but gimme a sign if you do want to change it. 
 
Otherwise, dandy room! `-Cristina

      <desc>This statue perfectly captures the essential traits of a Niffler, even in 
small details such as its fluffy fur.  The small creature is well-armed; its 
long, black claws, sprouting from buff-tinged mitts, are meant to dig 
through earth, but can just as well cut through flesh.  Tiny, but sharp, 
pointed teeth are visible beneath a beige snout.  Between the yellow and the 
black patches of colour on it, the Niffler might be a Hufflepuff mascot; the 
clever, though obstinate expression on its face is kind and joyful.  The 
quivering of the statue and its occasional, quick moves come with 
surprisingly-little noise, though to the Niffler's disappointment, it cannot 
leave the small pedestal it is perched on.

    <desc>Three paths shyly intrude through the watchful row of lampposts that 
stretches along the Hogwarts Driveway southeast, south, and southwest Two 
lanes of black pebbles wind to the west and east, through the yellowed 
grass.  Three more paths twist north, northeast, and northwest, headed to 
the greenhouses and to the Gamekeeper's hut.  From where these paths meet 
sprouts the black statue of an average-height, rotund woman facing south.  
Her clothes aim at comfort, smothering her in numerous folds.  Her only 
concessions to style are the Hufflepuff crest on her cloak and her 
large-brimmed hat, to protect her from the sun.  Underneath it, her face is 
as round as her stomach and a brilliant smile puffs out her already chubby 
cheeks.  However, the oversized badger on the statue's socle is snarling in 
menace.  Oblivious to the animal's threat, she is beckoning people to her 
with her left hand.

    <desc>Widely-spaced poles stand to the south of the patch, allowing paths to 
wiggle out to the south, southeast, and southwest.  A path leads east to the 
outer walls and west to Hogwarts castle.  Three lanes contort through the 
bright yellow grass to the north, northeast, and northwest.  The middle of 
the patch, where all those trails of reddish pebbles meet, is inhabited by 
the equally reddish statue of a stout, but very nifty man facing south.  
Under the cockily, angled hat and its dandy eagle feather, his head is 
arched back with a hearty, roaring laughter; his sharp features, aquiline 
nose, high cheekbones, and full lips framed by his trim goatee are perfectly 
visible against the sky.  His sturdy body is that of an once athletic man 
now gone slightly to seeds.  His garments are of Muggle origin: a shirt, a 
vest, and pants.  Neat leather boots, gloves and belt complement the outfit 
as well as a billowing cloak with the Gryffindor crest.  A lion is curled on 
the statue's socle, heedlessly asleep.

    <desc>Although chipped in places and obviously very old, the wall stands as a tall 
barrier between the southwestern village of Hogsmeade and Hogwarts Castle.  
To the southeast and well within its protective grasp, the wizarding school 
appears like a splendid beast whose many heads proudly gaze up at the sky.  
The softly-perfumed air carries discreet hints of fresh, damp shrubs.  A 
village lies sprawled to the southwest, resembling the contents of a pipe 
that emits occasional puffs of smoke.  East of the wall, watching over the 
drive that sweeps south and southeast, is a tall statue of a tall, noble 
wizard.  A dark, contorted, twisted forest rises northward at a distance, 
hungrily gnawing at the grounds with branches of knobbly oaks.  To the 
southwest is a tall, black gate with thick, iron bars, while to the 
northeast, the wall proudly ploughs on.  
</desc>
    <editeds>1) the forest ed would have to go, but please keep it in your pocket, I'm sure it can be used somewere more appropriate.
 
2) if you use my suggestion regarding the presentation of the village in the desc, please add town to the keywords.
3) for the castle ed, I've added a rewriting, maily beacuse I don't think the Lake would be visible fot the wall, and because the Quidditch Pitch isn't relly souteast, but somewhere between south and southeast of the wall. As a note, I don't think &quot;glisten&quot; can be a noun, but if I'm wrong, I'd be please to learn. :D
4) Still for the castle ed, I think you should add beast and wizarding to the key word; If you use my suggestion for the desc, please also add esatern and vista.
 
5) Echo 1 is golden. For Echo 0, I suggest a small rewording, but it's purely a suggestion, the echo's good as it is: &quot;A strange, beastly scream is carried over from the north by a sudden blast of chilling wind.&quot;
 
That's all, dear evil queen!

    <editfirstcomments>Hello!
 
I love this room. There are some mistakes regarding directions, but I think it's due to the Grounds having been revamped rather than your spiffy writing. ;)
 
1) You mention Hogsmeade right in the first sentence as well as its direction. Yet in the 4th sentence, you write &quot;a village&quot; and gives again the direction: it may confuse players as to how many villages there are.
 
2) The castle is not only southeast of this vnum, but blocked the whole eastern vista.
 
3) I absolutely love the image of the knobbly oaks. However, the Forest is not visible to the north, at best to the northeast. And even then, I think the Greenhouses would block the view.
 
I really love your imagery here, be it the beast or the knobbly oaks. I'm giving a suggestion on your desc, but please feel free to rearrange of you see fit.

    <desc>The strong grey of the wall is too dark to become dull, but its odd 
chippings and rounded edges soften its forbidding appearance.  Surrounded by 
grass and thickets of wild bushes, the barrier appears almost natural: a 
caprice of nature instead of Man's design.  Enclosed within it, a large, 
brightly-coloured park grows around the stone citadel that is Hogwarts.  A 
walkway, bordered by fresh grass, is visible from the point where it leaves 
the double doors of the southeastern castle until it dives beneath an iron 
gate that stands further southwest.  Beyond the gates, the drive becomes a 
simple dirt path going into the village of Hogsmeade, which lies southwest.  
Northwards rises a gloomy, tormented, dark forest that breaks the monotony 
of the grey barrier and hungrily eats into the Hogwarts Grounds.  The high 
wall continues to widely circle southwest and northwest, around the castle.  
</desc>
    <editeds>The echoes are golden, so I'l move on to the eds:
 
1) please add double door as the keywords for your castel ed. It may be interesting to add a sentence about how the doors are so imposing that they can be seen for a long distance.
 
2) change the southeast keyword of your Hogsmeade village to southwest. ;)

    <editfirst>The strong grey of the wall is too dark to be toned down, but its odd 
chippings and rounded edges soften its forbidding appearance.  Surrounded by

widely circle southwest and northwest, around the large, brightly-coloured

    <editfirstcomments>Some time ago, you reproached me, and rightly so, not to broaden enough my desc outside of the vnum itself. You may have the opposite tendency. Although in this case, the wall's height probably justifies that we can see the village.
 
I'm just afraid that, if we announce too soon the forest or the village, the players may get frustrated if they don't get there within a handful of rooms. Or, we should have made the progression so that it became a little more visible in each room, so that the player do have the impression of getting closer.
 
Plus, we want to guide the player, particularly in Hogwarts; but we don't want to guide them too much; they should explore and yes, get lost sometimes, not knowing if they're north of south of the Grounds.
 
Well, anyway, that was just a thought, please tell me if you feel it's justified or if I should foloow your guidance.
 
Onto the desc itself: I found it a but muddled and I've rearranged things a bit:
 
1) when I first read about the park, I thought this vnum had a small enclosure against/within the wall.
 
2) You wrote about the wall, then went on to the drive, and suddenly came back to the wall. Combining comments 1 and 2, I've rearranged the sentences.
 
3) I haven't changed anything in that sense, but a better transition between the stone citadel and the double door may be found. Rather than starting sentence 4 with the walkway, which we don't know whence it came, why not start from the double door of the castle, since sentence 3 finished with a mention of it? Feel free not to listen to this though.
 
4) last and least, I thought &quot;dull&quot; sounded strange and changed it to &quot;toned down&quot;. What do you think, Is it what you meant?

    <desc>The wall lazily curves to the northwest, its hard surface broken and chipped 
at corners so that its edges are nearly rounded.  Set between Hogsmeade and 
Hogwarts Castle, the barrier appears impenetrable and strong despite its 
impressive age.  Its granite roots bathe to the west in the shrubberies that 
border the dirt path to the wizarding village, while to the east, patches of 
fresh grass embrace its hard surface.  Within its protective grasp, Hogwarts 
rises from the surrounding park like a Phoenix with outstretched wings.  
Further to the south, the tall hoops of the Quidditch stadium are surrounded 
by beige-coloured, tall stands.  Contrasting with its lively, bright 
surroundings, the dark forest that stands to the north appears to be a 
fountain of twisted darkness, sending waves of thick, musky scents into the 
air.  As the wall continues southeast, it reaches a tall, iron gate.

      <desc>These trees are evergreen, bringing a very welcome touch of colour during 
the bleaker parts of the year.  The leaves are peculiar, however, their 
shape not oblong, but branching off in coral-like formations.  In autumn, 
cones add their warm, brown globes as a charming contrast in hue and shape 
to the ever-present dark-green of the foliage.  The trunks are almost black, 
and weep tears of saps at all time.  The rather sombre ensemble sets off the 
chalk-white of the statues that they close around.

      <desc>This statue depicts a man dressed in a plain loincloth.  On his sculpted, 
muscular, well-defined back are slung a bow and quiver; on the latter is 
inscribed &quot;Cyparissus&quot;.  At his feet lies the statue of a dying stag, a 
javelin thrust deep in its side.  Despite what appears to represent a 
successful scene, the stone hunter's head hangs low, and crystal tears adorn 
his cheeks.

    <desc>A tall, dark-green forest stretches into the Hogwarts grounds from the 
northeast, covered in a veil of leaves and hedges.  Branches and twigs 
interlock with one another in doubly-reinforced webs, bracing against any 
buffeting winds.  The wall slithers north towards the cluster of trees, 
sinking deeply within their hungry jaws, while to the south stands a heavy, 
black, iron gate.  Rising above boughs in mixing tinges of green is the 
reassuring, splendid Hogwarts, its towers plunging into the heavens like 
proud, powerful wands, wielded by the Founders themselves.  A thicket of 
oaks stands to the west of the wall, inaccessible from such height and 
preventing any possible view of the village of Hogsmeade to the southwest.  
At the foot of the stone barrier, to the east, below a sheer drop of thirty 
feet or so, timid patches of grass slowly grow into weeds as they approach 
the hedges and the undergrowth of the Forbidden Forest.

      <desc>Looming ever closer to the wall, the Forbidden Forest appears to be made out 
of very old trees, with barks lined by the scars of time and weather.  
Hedges embrace their elderly trunks, forming a thick, thorny coat that 
shelters them from both cold temperatures and from unfriendly beasts.  Some 
of the trees show malformations in their growth because they are so close to 
their brethren, while burns and strange, reddish wounds mar the perfection 
of others.  However different though, every bit of the forest moves and 
lives in unison, as though only a part of a gigantic organism.

    <desc>A shallow gap in the surface of the otherwise-whole wall has been rounded at 
the edges by wind and weather, nearly to the point of making it 
indistinguishable.  The entire barrier between Hogsmeade and Hogwarts shows 
signs of old age, with evened corners and chippings cracking its surface at 
irregular intervals.  To the east, encircled by the massive wall, stands 
Hogwarts castle, its towers cutting through the sky like an ancient, 
magnificent bird of sorts.  The village expands far to the southwest, 
visible only as a grey and green cloud, reaching out with elongated, thin 
arms that pass by tiny cottages scattered around its northern pathways.  To 
the north and northeast looms an ever-dark, thick forest, crawling slowly 
further into the park that surrounds the wizarding school.  As majestic and 
everlasting, a Quidditch Pitch surrounded by high stands is visible in the 
distance, opposing the woods.  The wall steadily goes on northwards and 
southwards, circling the citadel in a wide arch.

clearly visible, its many windows in various states of cleanness, with some

it approaches the gates of Hogwarts.  Little houses line the road on both 
sides, some larger and some smaller, their walls and rooftops painted in 
beautiful tinges of white and scarlet.  Far to the west, a lonely, abandoned

The air is temperate and alive with birds' comings and goings from the nests

      <desc>The trees stand strong with a reddish brown bark.  The leaves are about 
thirty centimetres long and grouped in bunches of five.  The flowers sit in 
these bunches, most of them have already blossomed and are shining 
radiantly, the white petals reflecting off the sun.  The other unopened 
flowers are small buds covered with thin green leaves, cradling the young 
petals.  The branches reach from the trunk, elegant and thinning as they 
stretch.  They embrace the nests of birds, the hives of bees, and the 
sleeping places of squirrels.

</desc>
    <editdraftcomments>Hello! I like the description of the flowers, eversmiling. :D Here are some pointers to make the room even better. I'm detailing in these comments my suggestions (between brackets) and why I'm suggesting these.
 
In your first sentence, &quot;edge&quot; sounds vague to me: do you mean a cliff or a groove on each side of the path? Please precise.
 
In the third sentence, &quot;ahead&quot; and &quot;to the back&quot; refers to the current position of the player; but you don't know what direction they'll be coming from or facing. So, please use directions like north, south, etc.
 
In the sixth sentence, you make it sound like the road (ahead, to the back) is only going from, say, north to south, or west to east: but the map shows we can access any of the eight surrounding patches from this room. Please explain the others exits (for example, stairs along the &quot;edge&quot;.
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>As a general observation, your echoes are a bit long, and long to read.  Instead of just bringing some life to the room, they may distract the player. Though they are beautiful to read, I suggest these changes:
 
1) you're describing a very changing, from second to second, phenomenon (sunset), and yet the sentence is very precise in the colour scheme. Plus, it doesn't take into account that depending on the season, the amount of clouds or rain or whatever other weather, the appearance may vary drastically from one day to another. So, try something more consensual, like &quot;The golden sun, as it sets, merges with the faint, distant sky, (leaving coloured traces of its presence behind)&quot;. That would also take care of the length problem.
 
2) Echoes are only sudden, brief events happening in a flash, while this echo describes something that is a bit longer, mostly because of the -ing form of &quot;flying&quot;. Please shorten it to something akin to &quot;A brown owl takes a sharp turn in mid-air and comes so low it almost sweeps the dust on the ground.&quot;

    <desc>The solid, granite wall runs parallel to the impressive Hogwarts Castle, 
heading north and south.  Old scratches mar the nearly-flawless, rounded, 
weathered surface of the strong wall that separates Hogwarts from the 
village of Hogsmeade.  Timid moss makes its way up the cracks in the stone 
barrier, crawling lazily atop its scars, like drops of a green, healing 
salve.  Drawing ever closer is the dark silhouette of a thick forest that 
stretches to the north and to the northeast, swallowing part of the wall 
within its dark jaws.  The village that extends to the west and southwest is 
barely visible in the far distance.  Providing powerful contrast with the 
dimished view, a large citadel rises impressively to the east, covering the 
horizon like a reassuring, friendly, stern watcher.

    <editdraftcomments>Chris, I really like this room here :) side note: we do use british spelling 
here, so please make sure you adjust accordingly.  If you need help with 
that, a great site is: http://www2.  Gsu.  
Edu/`-wwwesl/egw/jones/differences.  Htm I really like your beginning here 
with the sun and moonlight 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Your echo here is fantastic, and the only change I made in your ed was the 
spelling of center.  Well done.  :) `-mira 
</editeds>
    <editfirst>A small cluster of trees several lengths tall, sprout up from the ground 
here.  Their dark, purplish leaves filter and mute both sunlight and 
moonlight so that dust motes are visible, dancing in beams of light.  The 
trees have tall, straight trunks with branches that do not begin to appear 
until several met(res) off the ground.  The undergrowth is sparse and 
patchy, with grass sprouting up where it can find enough nourishment and 
light to sustain it.  The trees are closely spaced, with little room to 
navigate unless one takes the slightly wider, dusty path running haphazardly 
through the cent(re).  In the exact cent(re), the path widens and forms a 
circle before continuing on the other side.  In the middle of this circle is 
a bench, and since no trees are planted near it, light can make it through a 
small hole at the top of the leaves and fall on the bench, illuminating it.  
The Hogwarts Wall is directly to the east and south, while the grounds 
continue on to the north and west.

      <desc>This small bench is carefully sculpted from white marble.  Scrolling is 
heavily used here for an elegant effect.  In the center of the top, the 
Hogwarts crest is carved, and the four legs are the Gryffindor lion, the 
Ravenclaw raven, the Slytherin snake, and the Hufflepuff badger.  It 
sparkles and glimmers in the light.

    <editdraftcomments>Ok, this room is almost pulling me out of my funk, :) I like how you said 
the castle is looking like it's trying to tickle the sky, lol.  Very nice.  
I've just done some regular grammar edits and such.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1. I am reluctant to allow echoes 0,1, and 2 here, since they've been used in another room and the room should be quite close-by. If you can rephrase them so they don't sound so similar though, please do and send me a note about that.
 
2. Please change echo number 3 to: 'Blurry, but nonetheless ominous, silhouettes tremble agitatedly against the glass wall of the northwestern greenhouses, mercifully imprisoned within.' Please remember that you don't mention any greenhouses in the desc, so you need to tell the people where these greenhouses are. Please also change the times to daylight hours, cuz that's when things like that are visible.
 
3. In echo number 4: when you have something 'demanding attention', you need to make an ed about it, cuz it will really get to the players. Please rephrase the echo to: 'A dark shape rasps sharply against the glass of the nearest, northwestern greenhouse(, demanding attention).' You can choose to keep the text between the brackets or not, depending on what you feel like doing.
 
4. Please rephrase this to: 'A harsh, animated rustle reaches out from within the northwestern greenhouse, ending abruptly in a shrill shriek.' 
 
EDS:
 
I've edited both eds and left comments in one of them. I think my favourite bit of this room is the details of heraldry you give in your ed. A nice room overall, very well done! `-Cristina

    <editsecondcomments>I liked your descriptions of the exits, because they are very atmospheric. However, this room lacked some cohesion between these exits and a few of the cardinal directions were a bit off. I tried to rephrase the desc somewhat; as ever, you are free not to take my suggestions, as long as you send me a note so I can take another look. `-Cristina

      <desc>The sculpted woman is obviously very pregnant.  There is, however, not even 
the slightest hint of trepidation, nor of excitement, on her countenance; on 
the contrary, she bears her closed crown with utmost serenity.  Though 
careful of her inflated belly, she encircles a most unusual blazon with her 
right hand; in her left, upward-facing palm rests a &quot;globus cruciber&quot;.  The 
throne she reclines in is carved so as to give frontal observers the 
appearance that the woman has wooden wings protruding out of her back.

      <desc>This blazon is unusual in that it is &quot;en enquerre&quot;, meaning that it 
juxtaposes two colours of the same family, rather than using metal-enamel 
contrasts to aid heraldic reading.  In this particular case, the hue known 
as &quot;argent&quot; collides with &quot;or&quot;; a golden eagle with upturned wings is 
embossed here on a silver field.  Far less obvious in its peculiarity, a 
rectangle is drawn on the side of the blazon that is closest to the statue; 
within the geometric design, the letters &quot;III&quot; are clearly visible.

      <desc>In daytime, dark blurs appear behind the glass of the northwestern 
greenhouse.  One shape in particular likes to rasp against the windows, 
shake the panels, and generally attract attention.  Sometimes, it leans a 
whole, sinuous, sinewy tentacle against the glass; on other occasions, it 
tries to strangle a few thin pegs, which were probably put there to provide 
some sort of support to the plant's limp organs.  Though seeing it in the 
darkness might be difficult, this particular plant's location is easily to 
pinpoint even at night, as it is the origin of some often-heard unholy 
shrieks.

    <editdraft>A picket fence, stained forest green, corners off a small section of 
well-trodden grass.  Within, a wide, dove-grey, stone potting bench 
dominates the space, smelling thickly of raw earth, tinged with the putrid 
aroma of well-matured dragon's dung.  Various garden instruments embellish 
the bench, hanging from the topmost shelf.  A mishmash of different sized 
terracotta planters smothers it, seeming to be everywhere.  They even cover 
the faded ground and litter the area with the occasional broken piece of 
ceramic ware.  A watering can, that has seen better days, and a tall shovel 
lie next to the bench, splattered with wet mud.  Three ample, wooden barrels 
line the fence, their contents determined by what scent they give off.  The 
entrance to the greenhouses dwell to the east, and a well maintained 
vegetable garden grows southeasterly.  Trees shroud the view in all western 
directions and weeds grow wildly to the north and south.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>This desc is absolutely awesome. Apart from tweaking your singular-plural grammar here and there and working on the commas, there is little I had to do here. I love the amount of description you have here! Awesome work, and well, well done! Hugs, Cristina

potting bench.  No lid covers its top and as a result, flies congregate 
around the cask of gooey, lumpy fertiliser, which leaks over the edges and 
dries on the grass below.  The centre barrel, thankfully a good interval 
from its smelly counterpart, is smothered in soil the shade of dark humus 
and emits an aroma of rich earth.  The final barrel is the only one that 
gives off no scent.  A metal spigot, like that found on a wine keg, is 
attached to it.  Occasionally, a drop of water leaks from the tap, creating 
a muddy pool on the sparsely grassed ground below.

    <desc>In season, this patch of weeds is primarily decked in white and red, with 
only small touches of green on various leaves and stems.  The white comes 
from wild-carrot flowers and hairy, mugwort leaves; the red is generously 
scattered between the mugwort stems and the inflorescences of mugworts, red 
sorrels, and wild-carrots.  The plants occasionally arch over six dirt 
trails that lead respectively to the northern Whomping Willow, to the 
northwestern Gamekeeper's Hut, to the western, southwestern, and southern 
groves, and to the southeastern vegetable gardens.  The eastern border of 
this patch is the glass wall of one of the greenhouses; within the building, 
plants of all imaginable sorts, varying in temperament, knot and twist 
around each other, forming a rather-ominous hedge.

    <editdraft>In season, this patch of weed is primarily decked in white and red, while 
only small touches green from the leaves or stems pierce through.  The white 
comes from wild carrot's flowers and mugwort's hairy leaves, while the red 
appears parsimoniously in wild carrot's inflorescences, features more 
prominently in red sorrel's and mugwort's ones, and also tints the mugwort's 
stems.  The plants occasionally arch over the six dirt trails that lead to

    <editdraftcomments>Overall, carole, this room is really great!  Just a few adjustments as 
always, and I love learning new words from you, it's so fun.  :) 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1. Please change echo number 1 to: 'A pleasant scent, reminiscent of lemon and carrots, swirls up in the air.'
 
2. Please change echo number 2 to: 'The plants yield to a sudden gust of wind.' The reason for this change is that, unless we make the gust momentary, we intrude in the weather system.
 
EDS:
 
I've tweaked both eds a little bit. In the ed of 'carrot', you said that there are differences between the hemlock and the wild-carrot, but then only told us about the wild-carrot, and not about the carrot in comparison to the hemlock. I've taken the liberty of rephrasing somewhat; I hope you like the way it is written just now. However, if you disagree, please feel free to use your own wording. In the 'sorrel' ed, the last sentence sounded slightly muddled, so I rephrased it somewhat.
</editeds>
    <editfirst>. In season, this patch of weed(s) (are) primarily decked in white and red, 
while only small touches (of) green from the leaves or stems pierce through. 
 The white comes from (the) wild carrot's flowers and mugwort's hairy 
leaves, while the red appears parsimoniously in wild carrot's 
inflorescences, (which) features more prominently in red sorrel's and 
mugwort's ones, and also tints the mugwort's stems.  The plants occasionally 
arch over the six dirt trails that lead to the northern Whomping Willow, to 
the northwestern Gamekeeper's Hut, to the western, southwester, and southern

    <editfirstcomments>When I wrote &quot;the red appears parsimoniously in wild carrot's 
inflorescences, features more prominently in red sorrel's and mugwort's 
ones, and also tints the mugwort's stems&quot;, I meant for the three verbs to 
relate to &quot;red&quot;.  Maybe I worded it wrong, hence the suggestion of a 
&quot;which&quot;, that would relate to the &quot;inflorescences&quot;.  If you think I should 
rewrite this to make it more clear, please just tell me.  Other than that, 
thank you so much Mira for your work and your praises.  :D

of all imaginable sorts, varying in temperament, knot and twist around each 
other, forming a rather-ominous hedge.)  
</editsecond>
    <editsecondcomments>I do agree with Mira that the part of your second sentence regarding the red colour was a bit confusing, so I rephrased it somewhat. Please feel free to adopt a different turn of phrase if you think it necessary, and then gimme a note reminder so I look at it again. You only had three sentences here, so I added a fourth; please feel free to rephrase that, too, but bear in mind that this room runs just beside the greenhouses, so you WOULD see something of it if you were here.
 
Otherwise, the room is golden. Nice assortment of colours - I do love red, especially crimson red. `-Cristina

      <desc>From the red sorrel's crown of sparse, arrowhead-shaped, light-green leaves 
sprouts a long, upright, single stem.  This is the stem that, in season, 
bears deep-red, slightly brownish flowers.  The plant lets off a tangy, 
lemony smell.  Though lovely to behold, the sorrel is considered a weed 
because of the considerable difficulty one has in removing it, due to the 
sorrel's aggressive rhizome; moreover, though appealing to herbivores, it 
can be slightly toxic in very large quantities.

      <desc>The plant is silvery-green, and, in season, it is crowned with flat-topped 
clusters of white flowers.  These look very similar to hemlock 
inflorescences, though the two plants differ in a few important points.  
Unlike the sharp, pointed leaves of the hemlock, wild carrots have clusters 
of soft, tiny, furry, oval leaves, as well as a growth of fine hair cropped 
along their stems.  Actually related to the edible carrot, this wilder 
species has a scent reminiscent of the well-known vegetable.  While the 
hemlock has purely-white flowers, it is not unheard of to have a dark-red 
flower adorning the white umbel of wild carrot; indeed, in this particular 
area, maybe because of the overall magic that suffuses the Hogwarts Grounds, 
every single wild-carrot plant sports this little, ruby-coloured addition.

      <desc>Mugwort is a quite tall plant, which can grow up to seven feet high.  The 
stems are a dark, purplish red that becomes slightly translucent as the 
stalks taper out.  The minute flowers are equally dark-red, at least in this 
patch; they can be also dark-yellow.  The leaves are deep-green, but look 
white, due to the dense cover of white hair on their underside.  The plant's 
smell is pleasant, but faint; it is repulsive to most insects.

    <desc>Past the roofs of not-so-distant greenhouses, the Hogwarts Castle is 
silhouetted against the eastern sky of this patch of earth.  Apart from 
these far-away buildings, the surrounding areas consist mostly of patches of 
low-growing plants, though copses can be accessed to southwest, west, and 
north.  All cardinal directions are open to passers-by.  Further up north, a

    <editdraftcomments>Dearest Carole, I've brushed up a few details in this desc, and added the surrounding exits. Please let me know what you think of my changes, and as ever, thank you so much for your work! Much love, Cris
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Echo number [0]: please change 'the' to 'a'. Also, please add a comma after 'screams of'. I actually also don't understand the second sentence of the elf's lament; I would write instead something like: 'Can't even resist the iron maidens' water!' or something like that.
 
2) Echo number [1]: please change this echo to: 'A student daintly cups water in her hands, and drinks it deeply.'
 
3) Echo number [2]: Please remove the hyphen between 'fountain' and 'maiden', change 'maiden' to 'maidens', and add a colon after 'metal'.
 
4) Echo number [3]: Please change 'erupted' to 'erupts' in this echo.
 
5) Echo number [6]: please change 'caryatid' to 'caryatids' here.
 
EDS:
 
I've edited all your eds. Please glance at them when you get a moment. I liked the eds of the tree and the fountain the most; they were so rustic and a very nice addition to your usual amazing work on statues. Great work, girl! `-Cristina

    <editfirstcomments>Hello!
 
About the strange house-elf in one of the echo: I've had this idea for a quest, where you had to &quot;help&quot; the maidens. The answer to the quest in a nut, hence the maidens saying (in their ed and an echo): &quot;It's a nut job&quot;... I'll probably have to work some more on this though.

      <desc>This walnut tree is more than forty feet high, and almost as wide.  Its 
almond-shaped leaves fall in autumn, only to better unveil the green-encased 
nuts.  Upon splitting open the two halves of the fruit, the succulent 
content is finally revealed.  During the appropriate season, house-elves are 
busy retrieving the walnuts, lest the students consume everything on the 
tree; indeed, the patch is littered with cracked-open shells throughout 
autumn.  Come winter, for more than half a year, peace again covers this 
area.

      <desc>The nearby walnut tree, or rather its nuts, attracts house-elves and 
students alike, and over the happy sounds and activities of large and small 
alike, a fountain giggles merrily by the foot of the tree.  Cast iron is 
melded in this edifice after the fashion of a Wallace fountain: on a 
waist-high column, four little caryatides hold up a spiked dome.  From the 
centre of the pillar, between the sculpted women, gurgles up water; the 
vital liquid then pools by the sides of the pedestal, where half-bowls are 
wrought in-between each pair of maidens.

      <desc>These wrought maidens are tall and sturdy, the muscles in their naked arms 
clearly straining to hold aloft the cast-iron dome; some rust spots mar the 
smooth, hard skin.  In spite of that, the limbs revealed by their 
short-sleeved, broche-closed boleros gracefully arch upwards, and their 
linen, plaited tunics only outline the elegant posture of their bodies.  
Moreover, they are smiling and often spare a heavy, metal blink to the 
onlooker, or even joke in raspy whispers: &quot;This is a nut job&quot;.

A steep slope struggles northward here, bordered by a chestnut and hickory grove to the west, south, and northwest.  The ground is not smooth.  However, much a short, seasonal coverlet of grass attempts to hide this within its level, rolling splendour.  During the warmer part of the year, the lush, vivid colour of the tiny blades is complemented by the explosion of fiery-red, thick patches of Acer trees.  These originally-Japanese maples stand five to six feet in height, forming a mere mound of bushes against the tall, solid mass of trees to the west, and against the grey mass of the Hogwarts Wall to the southwest.  From atop the steep hillock, the thicket of Acer trees resembles the flaming-red heads of fifteen generations of Weasleys.  To the north, northeast, east, and southeast, the Grounds spread out like a palmed-shaped imitation of an Acer leaf.

      <desc>The Acer trees are so closely planted to one another that often their boughs 
are braided together.  Their colour varies across the seasons, from a timid 
green during spring to their fully-red splendour of their autumn coats.  At 
the peak of their magnificence, shockingly brilliant shades of crimson and 
pink spread like wine droplets, frozen in palmate leaves, abundantly 
covering the brown branches like a rustling, satin gown.  A golden glitter 
speckled through their boughs gives off elusive, gentle glows when touched.

The granite barrier extends west and northwest, and its weather-wreathed

    <desc>Wind and rain have smoothed and rounded the eastern edges of the dark-grey 
wall, in contrast to the bumpy western side, which is protected by the 
beginnings of an oak forest.  The high, stone barrier separating Hogwarts 
and Hogsmeade turns northwest lazily, widening its dominion as it circles 
the wizarding school.  Its northern part is lost amidst the contorted trees 
of a dark, savage-looking forest that stretches across the horizon to the 
northeast, presumably on both sides of the wall.  The woods nearly kiss 
Hogwarts' northernmost wing, with a clean patch of low grass remaining the 
only thing that separates the two.  Far to the south, the Quidditch stands 
catch the eye with their perfect ellipsoidal form, while six circular hoops 
rise above them, their frames barely distinguishable in the distance.  The 
wall leads south to a heavy, iron gate, beneath which stretches a lazy road.

runs parallel with the surrounding, stone wall turns inwards.  The building 
is magnificent and very tall, with high towers thrusting upwards through the

quite solid and standing strong despite the many hardships it must have gone 
through, the citadel emanates a strange aura of friendship and peace.

narrow strip of ground separating the two.  The trees are contorted and 
huddled against each other, as though afraid or overly protective.  Long, 
thin branches intertwine with each other in an endless labyrinth, covered by 
leaves of all colours during most of the year or by a thick blanket of snow 
in winter.  The two oaks that stand closes to the castle appear to have 
grown twisted around each other, blocking the path as though some sort of 
magical barrier had forced them backward.

Directly under the covering huddles a teeming hive; in its shade grows a 
thick carpet of common, stinging nettles.  Only the six paths to the north, 
south, west, northeast, southwest, and northwest, are trimmed free of 
plants; these lanes are so narrow that a step beside their very middle leads 
to severe itches from urticant growths.  For those not confident enough in 
their sense of balance, levitation is highly recommended.  The Forbidden 
Forest looms beyond the impressive bulks of the northern Whomping Willow and 
the northwestern Gamekeeper's Hut, whereas the shroud of twisted trees is 
clearly visible to the far northeast.  To the distant west, occasional 
groves and copses somewhat veil the Hogwarts outer wall.  The south vista is 
a bit restricted by a nearby greenhouse, which blocks the eastern and 
southeastern exits, but an open patch past the glass building's corner is 
partly visible.

Directly under the covering, huddles a teeming hive, and in its shade, grows

right in the middle of the lanes allows not to brush against the urticant

    <editdraftcomments>Carole, great overall room!  :) I really like the way you described these 
thick paths, hehe.  One comment though, 'urticant' came up red and 
underlined in my word program, which means a spelling error I believe.  This 
didn't come up as a word either, when I tried looking it up through the word 
dictionary.  As long as this is the intended word you mean, I think your'e 
golden!  :) 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1. Please change echo number 0 to: 'A house-elf collects whatever nettles, leaves, flowers, or roots the season has blessed this patch with.'
 
2. Please change echo number 3 to: 'A grey, furry-bodied insect flies out of its hive, its whizzing strangely depressing.'
 
EDS:
 
I've edited the eds of 'canopy' and of 'nettles'. Please add 'greenhouse' to the keywords of the 'canopy' ed. Also, please add a text to your third ed, which contains nothing at the present. Please also send me a note once that's done. A lovely bunch of nettles you have here! `-Cristina
</editeds>
    <editfirst>From a Greenhouse's corner to the southeast, a glass canopy (fans out).  
Directly under the covering huddles a teeming hive, and in its shade grows a 
thick carpet of common, sticking nettles.  Only six narrow paths are trimmed 
free of the plants.  They are so narrow in fact, that only walking right in 
the middle of the lanes allows not to brush against the urticant growths; 
walking side by side or by another (way) means getting stung, except if 
levitation or flight are used.  The Forbidden Forest lines the northeast, 
northwest, and north, although in that (last) particular direction, the 
impressive bulk of the Whomping Willow kind of hides the larger body of 
trees.  Likewise, the Gamekeeper's Hut stands guard to the northwest before 
the Forest.  To the west, more grove and copses of trees somewhat veil 
another formidable barrier, that of the (o)uter wall.  The south vista is a 
bit restricted by the Greenhouse, but an open ground past its corner can be 
half-guessed, half-seen.  The building blocks the southwest and west (exits 
entirely).  
</editfirst>
    <editsecond>From the southeast corner of a greenhouse, a glass canopy fans out.  
Directly under the covering huddles a teeming hive; in its shade grows a 
thick carpet of common, sticking nettles.  Only the six paths to the north, 
south, west, northeast, southwest, and northwest, are trimmed free of 
plants; these lanes are so narrow that a step beside their very middle leads 
to severe itches from urticant growths.  For those not confident enough of 
their sense of balance, levitation is highly recommended.  The Forbidden 
Forest looms beyond the impressive bulks of the northern Whomping Willow and 
the northwestern Gamekeeper's Hut, respectively; this shroud of twisted 
trees is clearly visible to the far northeast.  To the distant west, 
occasional groves and copses somewhat veil the Hogwarts outer wall.  The 
south vista is a bit restricted by a nearby greenhouse, which blocks the 
eastern and southeastern exits, but an open patch past the glass building's 
corner is partly visible.  
</editsecond>
    <editsecondcomments>Lovely Carole, I liked very much your paths and their awesome urticant properties. However, the desc was a bit too long, so I tried to adjust it a little bit. Please also bear in mind that if you mention paths, you need to list their directions immediately, so people connect the paths with the exits.
 
For the rest, awesomely done, as ever, and thank you SO much! `-Cristina

      <desc>Other than the glass canopy, no support is provided for this hive, and the 
industrious insects had to build it almost from scratch.  The form is 
irregular and lumpy, and the wax, instead of being a warm gold, is a dirty, 
greyish yellow.  A teeming swarm surrounds the hive, flying in and out.  The 
insects look like bees, except for the grey colour of their furry body; this 
identifies them as Glumbumbles, who produce a melancholy-inducing treacle.

      <desc>The nettles can grow up to six feet tall, but they generally crouch against 
the ground in winter; when this happens, only the yellow, distinctive roots 
are visible, cropped here and there.  In spring and summer, the stems and 
long, highly-serrated, and acuminate leaves of this plant offer their soft 
green and silvery sheen, but also their silky, urticant hairs.  Despite 
their itchy fur, the leaves are highly useful; once they are removed, the 
plant can also be eaten or used in potions.  Grapes of small, green 
inflorescences adorn the shiny thicket.

      <desc>The canopy extends out and around the corner of the greenhouse, spanning a 
three-quarter circle.  A single, sturdy needle of black iron leans against 
the corner underneath it; from it, highly-intricate, &quot;Art Nouveau&quot; shapes 
outline the general form of a triangle, point down.  From the top of the 
vertical, iron needle, additional, similar needles fan out at a 
slightly-downward angle; frosted-glass panels are set between these.  The 
ball that tops the vertical, iron needle on the other side of the glass 
sheet is visible only from a height greater than a few feet.  Between this 
triangle, the wall of the greenhouse, and the glass, a hive is comfortably 
settled.

    <editdraft>An everlasting breeze overflows this patch of the grounds, gently rustling 
the evergreen pine trees that grow here in small groups, huddled together as 
if searching for shelter.  Carried by the breeze, a barely audible whisper 
imbues the air, touching everything from the trees and their lush green 
needles to the soft, moss-covered ground.  Contrasting the rest of the

here, as if trying to catch a glimpse of eternity within its bounds.  The

    <editeds>Hi Kristina!
 
Echo 1 is mostly golden, I'l just ask you to delete the &quot;the&quot; before &quot;view&quot;. As for echo 0, the sentence is bit convoluted; I suggested &quot;A bird chirpping echoes nearby, no sign of life is visible anywhere around.&quot;, but your own suggestions are welcomed.
 
Thanks for the hard work!

    <editfirstcomments>Hello Kristina!
 
The imagery here is somptuous, but a bit muddled; mostly it's about subtle nuances in words, so that something kind of &quot;sound&quot; amiss, but you're not sure why. There are also a couple times when the formulation is heavy. Anyway, please review my suggestion and changes, but bear in mind that I absolutely love the imagery of eternity you're writing here.
 
Oh, and could you maybe explain this whisper a bit better? I'm suggesting &quot;hum&quot;, because it seems to me it's more logical for a hum to be constant and never-changing; however, you don't describe the whisper as such, and I'm maybe reading too much in this. Would you please expalin (in an ed would be magnificent!)

    <desc>This patch of thistles is comfortably nestled against northwestern, western, 
southwestern, and more distant, southern groves.  Paths lead into these 
copses, losing themselves behind the trees, at the foot of the Hogwarts 
outer wall or at the doorstep of the proud Gamekeeper's Hut.  Similar lanes 
lead in all other cardinal directions.  All the trails are bordered with 
rare, white, milk thistles and have to plough their way through 
silvery-mauve, cirsium arvense thistles and their coarse-burdock cousins.  A 
lone, ominous, gigantic, northeastern willow is visible in the distance, 
against the contorted shroud of a northern forest.  To the far east and 
southwest are a group of greenhouses, their facades lined up in a row that 
leads the way to the North Tower of Hogwarts Castle.

    <editdraft>This patch of thistles is comfortably nestled against northwestern, western, 
southwestern, and southern groves, although the latter is a little further 
way than the other three.  Behind the western and southwestern can be seen 
the Outer Wall, while behind the northwestern of these copses, the 
Gamekeeper's Hut stand up proudly.  A little more to the northeast, the 
Whomping Willow extends its ominous, humungous shadow.  Directly east, a 
succession of Greenhouses' facades leads to the North Tower of Hogwarts 
Castle.  To the southeast, past the southwestern corner of a Greenhouse, a 
vegetable patch is barely visible.  Eight paths, bordered with rare, white 
milk thistles, lead to all these landmarks, through more thistles, of the 
silvery-mauve cirsium arvense and coarse burdock kinds.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Oooh, another lovely room I really like :) especially the usage of the word 
facade!  What a good word.  My only comment, like in the last room, is that 
'cirsium arvense' came up red for me too, meaning it isn't a recognized 
word.  Maybe I'm more unknowledgable about words than I thought, hehe, just 
wanted to double check on this, and that's all.

    <editsecondcomments>I've changed and rearranged your desc here a little bit, dearest Carole, and here's why: Going through every cardinal direction and presenting yet another feature of land is confusing, and they will have to read this over and over again until the get the hang of it. Try to group as many of the exits as you can. 
 
As a second comment, please try to alternate the style of your sentences. Rather than having three sentence in a row describing exits and then at the end saying something about the texture of this place and the paths that lead to all the exits, try to put this somewhere in the middle, so that it gains more weight and more atmosphere.
 
Having said this, you are absolutely free to rephrase your writing in any way you wish. I have almost no objections as to the content of your rooms; the only thing that occasionally needs tweaking is the turn of phrase. You do have some lovely imagery here! Just try to meddle a bit with the form and I think you're going to have a superb specimen of a room here!

      <desc>Although milk thistles are generally a deep violet, this rarer, white 
variety seasonally shows a milky colouring as the flowers fluffily expand 
out of their large, spiny heads.  The quite thick, sturdy stem is thankfully 
devoid of thorns; that is, however, not the case for the waxy-lobed, 
serrated leaves.  As they line the eight paths out of this patch, the white 
thistles guarantee that passers-by walk in the middle of the lanes, away 
from their stinging reach.  Between growths of white thistle are a few, 
cropped thickets of silvery-mauve cirsium arvense and coarse burdocks.

 Although the plant looks somewhat threatening, its seasonal, gorgeous 
inflorescences more than make up for this disadvantage.  The fluffy heads 
are of a lovely, tender silvery-mauve that contrasts beautifully with the

burdock is actually cultivated at Hogwarts, rather than just being an 
invasive weed: the taproots, although out of flavour in European, Muggle, 
modern cuisine, are still a staple ingredient of the castle's meals.  Other 
than that, the plant is outstanding for the size of its foliage: the 
dark-green, ovate, coarse leaves can grow up to eighteen inches long.  They 
are also woolly underneath.

The leaves are large, thick, and veiny.  Their color is rich, a deeper green

a brighter green with dark lines drawn through them methodically.  Between

    <editeds>Hello Maryam!
 
Okay, the echoes are mostly good and I like the imagery. Two remarks though:
- Please lower the occurrence rate. As a general rule, 3% is the max we use on the mud.
- Please add a &quot;fruit&quot; after ?one? in echo 2 to clarify things. Alternatively, make the 2nd sentence into a fourth echo. I think it'd work better, but that's your call.
 
Also, I've edited the chesnut ed. I have one question: don't chestnut have a spiked, green pod in which are the glossy-brown nuts? If your chesnuts don't (because, you know, magic), please state so in the ed and desc.
 
See you

    <editfirstcomments>Hello Maryam
 
The desc is somewhat muddled ? which happens to the best of us and justifies my ?salary? as an editor. :D Have a look at my suggestions, mosly a rephrasing of what I though you meant.
 
One thing you have to add though, is that the leaves and chesnuts are present all year long. In time, we should hav seasonal desc/echoes/eds/ Don't hesitate to ?tag? this room and come back then. ;)
 
Until that glorious moment, keep up the good work!

    <desc>The dark shadow of a thick, impenetrable forest looms to the north, covering 
the horizon to the northeast in an explosion of intense brown and green.  
Everlasting and majestic, the trees rise in contorted but strong shapes, 
their branches and roots intertwining in large, thickly-woven webs.  
Matching the mute and terrifying beauty of the woods is the large, stone 
castle that stands tall to the east, a monument that has survived through 
many ages of hardship.  The wall runs north and southeast, standing at a 
distance from Hogwarts, with the two separated by a large park decorated 
with occasional patches of trees and glass-covered greenhouses.  On the 
western side of the dull-grey, stone barrier stands the village of 
Hogsmeade, obscured from view by an oak forest.

      <desc>Tall oaks, beech, and rosewood trees huddle against one another in a thick, 
dark forest, that smells of old age and decay.  Embracing their strong, 
scarred trunks are low, thorny hedges, some sporting light-coloured flowers. 
 A mat of ivy winds its way between bushes and trees alike, like a soft, 
ever-hungry carpet that sometimes makes its way up, towards the heavy boughs 
of nearby oaks.

      <desc>The castle stands tall, surrounded by small trees and tiny blades of grass 
that make its magnificence seem ten times greater.  Tall towers reach out 
towards the sky, plunging sharp tips towards the clouds in a gesture of 
fierce power and independence.  Rising upon the large park that separates 
the school from its surrounding wall are low greenhouses, covered in glass.  
Every ray of light coming from the sky is reflected by hundreds of windows 
of various sizes onto the greenhouses, creating a game of brilliant lights 
that comes and goes between the fleeting fragments of shadow.

twitching plants that nevertheless appear unable to break out.  The small 
buildings reflect any sunrays in a bright halo that makes them look like 
beaming, thick pillars of light.

    <desc>moncrief/chris is working here
</desc>
    <editdraft>Most of this space is dominated by a large holly bush, which has been 
permitted to grow with wild abandon.  The upper tip of the tall shrub is 
bent from the winds at that level, and is permanently pointing south.  The 
waxy, pointed green leaves are laden with clumps of small red berries, some 
of which have fallen off onto the ground surrounding the bush and are 
ripening in the sun.  The bush has a general round shape, although at one 
point there is a small concavity where someone tried to trim it.  The cut 
twigs have begun to regrow, with some already having a few buds.  The bush 
itself is surrounded with soft, neatly trimmed grass.  There is a small 
piece of fabric visible from within the bush.  To the south, a patch thick 
with nettles sprawls near the holly bush, leaving barely any room to walk 
past.  The ground to the north is much more turbulent, holding only 
turfgrass and rocky land.  A hazel thicket flourishes west of the holly 
bush, while the east lies in the shadow of the back of Greenhouse 4.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Other than a few exits being left out, which I threw in, this room will be 
ready for completion!  Regrow showed up as an error for me in Word, so I 
just put in a hyphen, and it didn't like turfgrass either, so I just made it 
2 separate words.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Shannon would like your squirrel echo here, :) and I was so curious about 
that piece of fabric!  That's cool you put that in there, very imaginative.

menacingly against the backdrop of the Forbidden Forest.  Adding depression 
to the atmosphere, a dry, lonely air exudes from the southwestern corner of 
a nearby greenhouse.  Luckily, more mighty, albeit agreeable, trees stand a

      <desc>The hazel trees in this patch are just the Muggle, common type, despite the 
proximity of so many magical plants.  Nonetheless, their fruits are very 
much appreciated and duly collected by house-elves in autumn.  Additionally, 
during most of the year, the plants' dark-green leaves contrast beautifully 
with the white-marble rotunda they shield.

      <desc>Any of the eight paths that stretch from all cardinal directions leads to 
this central thicket and rotunda; with the hazel shrubs hiding most of the 
rotunda, the construction's most stunning and visible trait is its 
gold-wrought hazel on its top.  At closer distance, every lane ends in a 
bower and opens the vegetal wall onto the round, marble, ten-foot-wide slab 
of a floor.  This horizontal supporting surface serves as a pedestal for 
eight caryatide statues, which in turn separate the bowers and support a 
dome half as tall as they are.  Whether the outside is decorated or not is 
subject to discussion, but adornment on the inside is in plain view: carved 
festoons in the fashion of cornucopia linked by their very products, can be 
fully admired and appreciated, all the more so when one is seated upon one 
of four little marble benches.  As intrusive as they can be, these wooden 
guardians make for good noise reducers and great eye-line breakers.

      <desc>In spite of their festive garbs, these sculpted caryatides bear 
expressionless, hieratic masks, and their strictly-upright, stone arms hold 
the dome a good seven feet in the air.  Crowns of hazel nuts and leaves 
adorn their unmoving hair, heavy jewellery dangles from their stone, ears, 
and necks.  Embroidered and sequined tunics are wrapped voluptuously around 
their unyielding bodies, and yet nothing but the cold of marble and death 
transpire from them.

1. Please change echo number 1 to: 'A gust of wind makes the table rattle on an unsteady leg.' The way you have phrased it sounds somewhat muddled.
 
EDS:
 
I've edited all your eds. In your ed of 'leg', you have both the original and the edited versions one after the other. I've edited the ed a bit so that you get rid of some of the repetition that you had. In the ed of 'table' I changed 'lie' to 'are', because I THOUGHT the pewter cauldron should be standing if it is to hold any liquid; however, if it should be lying down, please feel free to change it back.
 
All in all, awesomely done! `-Cristina

    <editsecondcomments>As in room 2520, I have tried to rearrange the lovely elements of this desc so that they sound more dynamic and less like an enumeration of exits. I do love the fact that you describe the exits so well; however, please try to load the reader with less info per word. They'll get a bit confused if you enumerate the exits, then tell them there are paths to all these landmarks, and then passingly mention the statue.
 
I've seen Mira comment on this in one of the earlier rooms I edited - your rooms are lovely; however, they do tend to have the same pattern. If you could change the order of the sentences a bit every now and again, it would be great. Thank you so much! `-Cristina

polished, so that an almost golden sheen covers the platter.  The corners 
are rounded out, and the legs are columns that gently taper down to the

his stout, muscled constitution is somewhat blurred by his white, elegant 
tuxedo.  A white top-hat, a white bowtie with a star dangling from it, and a 
large tuxedo belt, all made out of satin, complete the outfit.  The final

    <desc>A few young oak saplings huddle near the northern Gamekeeper's Hut, whereas 
a more ancient, sturdy oak stands proudly in the centre of this grove, 
beside a statue.  Another sculpture can be seen to the east, and more copses 
can be accessed to the south and west.  Past the western grove, a stretch of 
an outer wall is visible, extending unveiled to the southwest.  Finally, the 
northeastern and northwestern exits lead to vegetable and plant patches.  On 
a vegetal mattress of dark grass and soft moss rest all year long oak 
leaves, be they the tender, sweet green of spring, or tan and crispy with 
autumn, or even covered in winter's snow; their distinctive shape mimics the 
serpentine trails scuttling away in all directions.

    <editdraftcomments>Dear Carole, though your writing here is nearly flawless, I would like to see more details about this area here, rather than just a list of exits. Don't take this the wrong way: I adore your desc of the exits, but I am longing for something more about this area. What is it like, what is its texture and surface? Please add a few details here and then let me know about it, so I can take another look. `-Cristina
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please change 'plays' to 'play' in echo number [0].
 
2) I would suggest changing 'up' to 'upwards' in echo number [3], since it makes the imagery a lot more dynamic.
 
EDS:
 
I've edited both your eds. Please have a look at them when you have a moment. Good job, beautiful! `-Cristina

      <desc>The great oak is more than forty feet around, testimony to its age.  If the 
tree had grown straight upwards, it may have stood even higher, but it is 
convoluted and so its top branches &quot;only&quot; reach up to about a hundred feet 
in the air.  About halfway up is a kind of platform from whence spring half 
a dozen of knotty, somewhat-concave outgrowths; this gnarled, contorted, 
hand-like platform cradles a statue.

      <desc>The sculpture represents a beautiful, if somewhat stout, maiden.  She is 
lazily reclining against an oblique branch, one white-marble arm arched 
gracefully above her head.  Her luscious, short mane of hair is adorned with 
a crown of lobed, oak leaves, and oval acorns.  A simple toga drapes around 
her plump body, leaving her strong calves uncovered and her feet dangling 
off the tree.

    <desc>A multi-layered perfume lingers heavily in this copse of evergreen trees, 
which range from thirty to a hundred feet in height.  In fact, scent and 
height are the key clues to identifying three different species of laurels, 
cinnamons, bay laurels, and camphor trees here.  These species are used to 
climates warmer than that of Britain, but a spell has probably been cast on 
the patch, in addition to the protection of the outer wall to the south and 
west.  The temperature here is constantly on an agreeably-warm side, and the 
wind rarely blows violently.  Consequently, the couple of benches in this 
spot are often assaulted by students in winter.  More groves and plants add 
to the natural luxuriance of the area, to the northwest, north, east, and 
southeast.  Among this vegetal profusion, a statue is nearly completely

    <editfirstcomments>Cris, I had light all day, 'cause I was thinking of starlight/moonlight. However, I've used your idea, and just split the echo into a daytime one and a nighttime one.

      <desc>The smallest trees in this grove can be identified by their spicy, yet 
somewhat-sweet scent: they are cinnamon trees, as can be further proven in 
the appropriate seasons by their greenish flowers and purple berries.  A few 
of these trees have been allowed their full, natural growth, while the rest 
are little more than stumps, with fragile, thin offsets; it is these smaller 
trees that are harvested by the house-elves to make cinnamon quills.  
Standing a bit taller and only comprising fully-grown trees are a couple of 
bay laurels, as testified by their large, freshly-aromatic, almond-shaped 
leaves.  In season, these species bears yellow-green flowers and black 
berries.  Last, but not least, giving off a very specific, fresh, almost 
minty odour, the glossy, waxy leaves of the Camphor laurel reach the 
highest; bright-white flowers or black berries also adorn these plants, 
depending to the time of year

      <desc>The two benches are set on either side of this statue and they are made of 
the same stone: a kind of green jade.  The sculpture represents either a 
woman midway through transforming into a tree or a tree half-transfigured 
into a woman.  It is a trunk that is depicted springing from the soil, but 
at about two feet in the air, it morphs into thighs and hips.  The bust is 
recognisably feminine, as is the fear-stricken head that stares back to some 
unseen horror.  The woman's arms are held above the head, but change into 
branches right past the shoulders.  A crown of laurel leaves is set on her 
hair, a simple tunic covers her modesty, and a simple belt, also woven out 
of laurel leaves, girdles her slim waist.  On the girdle's buckle is carved 
in small lettering, &quot;Daphne&quot;.

    <desc>The branches and twigs of an oak forest reach eastward, towards the wall, 
nearly touching its sharp, old, dull-grey edges.  Ivy carpets the surface of 
the impenetrable, stone barrier, becoming thicker as the wall heads north 
into the jaws of the dark Forbidden Forest.  The entire horizon to the 
northeast is covered in a web of thickly-huddled trees that nearly touch the 
magnificent castle standing to its south.  Between the surrounding wall and 
Hogwarts, tiny greenhouses rise at regular intervals from amidst dirty, 
grass and hedge-strewn paths.  A distance away to the south is a heavy, iron 
gate, beneath which slithers a lonely road, connecting the wizarding school 
to the village of Hogsmeade.

thick with the rancid smell of decay.  Trees of all sorts stand close to 
each other, their branches friendly intertwining in a web of gigantic 
proportions, covered with snow in winter and with leaves of all colours 
during the rest of the year.  With tree trunks heavily wrapped in thorny 
hedges, the woods resemble a large, green beast, occasionally groaning and 
moaning in the wind.

</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>As ever, your work on the atmosphere here is absolutely great. You have the centrepiece of the area, the tree, well singled out and described, too! I've only made a few tweaks here and there. Probably one of my more important observations is that where you have emerald and jewels, you should make sure that the readers know what you mean: it COULD be that the grass is made of emeralds, or it COULD be that it's emerald-hued. I've gone for one approach; if it's the other, please do let me know. Also, please make sure you don't have words such as &quot;light-giving&quot; in the desc, since, though I understand what you mean, it will confuse the players, who will think that even during the night there is light from the heavens.  Along the same line of thought, please don't forget to add &quot;seasonal&quot; before flowers or grass, since snow will cover both up. Huggles, Cristina
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Your first echo has nothing &quot;wrong&quot; in it. However, since you are using a lot of harsh words, I think it might be better to change the echo to something like: 'A murder of coal-black crows explode into movement, abandoning the safety of the great oak to dart about the heavens like a plague of obsidian locusts.' This, however, is a suggestion; it remains to your choice whether to accept it or not.
 
2) I love this echo! However, please add a comma after &quot;moans&quot;.
 
3) Please add a comma in this echo after &quot;balmy&quot;. I really like how you portray the smoke in this echo; the imagery is very powerful!
 
EDS:
 
I've edited your ed a little bit. Mostly adding commas where they were needed. Please, however, do take a look, as it will show you where you need to add commas and, hopefully, also why. Well done on this room, Grace, and thank you so much for your efforts! `-Cristina

    <editfirstcomments>I noticed a mistake, it says a mix of evergreen and deciduous hornbeams, 
when hornbeams are purely deciduous trees, so I had to change that.  And 
also, I mention the oak, since it was quite vague that the oak exsisted.  
But other than that, it's fine!  :)

      <desc>The oak towers above all else, like a regal king amongst lowly pawns.  Its 
bark has the distinctive colour of smoke-tanned hide, with the rough texture 
of sandpaper.  Many holes and pits mar the shape of the tree: evidence that 
it has survived its fair share of storms and diseases.  Its thick boughs and 
many branches reach out in a way that is reminiscent of a giant stag's 
antlers, with healthy, seasonal, viridian leaves shooting from them.  
Smooth, cup-shaped acorns litter the ground below during the autumn, lying 
in the shadow of the tree's extensive form.

    <desc>A four-cornered, fifteen feet high by fifteen feet wide, animal pen boldly 
stands here, its roof covered in moss.  Besides the four pillars, two 
additional, northern and southern posts stretch to the base of the roof, 
bracing it.  Though there are no walls, an enchantment keeps the temperature 
within the pen bearable.  The ceiling has rafters angling towards its 
centre, as well as some horizontal support pieces.  There are four small 
pens in each corner of the building, each enclosure straw-strewn and 
separated from the next by a small walk-space.  A central walkway pierces 
the inside of the structure, with open, oak gates to the east and west; the 
same sign hangs above each of these exits.  The wood, though darkened by 
age, has seasonal, tiny, multicoloured flowers growing out of its small 
cracks and knots.  Hogwarts Grounds stretch out in all directions, except to 
the south, where the vista is practically blocked by a large hut.  To the 
far north lies the Forbidden Forest.

    <editdraft>. A four-cornered animal pen, its roof covered in moss, stands boldly amongst 
the surrounding areas.  The pen stands fifteen foot high by fifteen foot 
wide.  Aside from the four posts holding up the buildings corners, two posts 
on the north and south sides of the pen stretch to the tip of the roof, 
brace the structure.  There are no walls, the ceiling shows the rafters 
angling toward the centre of the roof as well as the horizontal support 
pieces.  There are four small pens in each corner of this structure.  
Between each of the pens a small walk space.  A central walkway pierces the 
inside of the structure with doors on the east and west.  The wood, though 
darkened by age, has tiny flowers of all different colours growing out of 
its small cracks and knots.  The ground inside each of the four pens is 
covered in straw.  A sign hangs above the gates at the east and west.  
Hogwarts grounds stretches out in all directions.  To the northern 
directions is the Forbidden Forest.

    <editdraftcomments>Dear Russell, this room has all the elements it needs to have, which is very, very nice. However, I did reword it so that it sounds clearer. A few important things, however:
 
1) Please mention, when you have flowers or grass, that they are seasonal (or there's an enchantment allowing them to grow throughout the year).
 
2) I've added an enchantment to keep the temperature inside bearable - if not, the animals would freeze during winter.
 
3) I've made the little gates permanently open. We don't have doors here; please don't mention doors unless the design specifically has them - otherwise the players will get confused trying to open them.
 
Overall, a good room, dear Russell, though it needed some polishing. Please do remember to ask me if you have any questions, or objections, regarding my editing. Thanks for all the hard work! `-Cristina

    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please change your echo to: &quot;An owl flies over the animal pen, on its way from the Forbidden Forrest towards Hogwarts Castle.&quot;
 
EDS:
 
1) I've edited the eds of &quot;signs&quot; and &quot;moss&quot;. Please add the keywords &quot;notices&quot; &quot;boards&quot; to the ed of &quot;signs&quot;, and the keywords &quot;green&quot; and &quot;wood&quot; to the ed of &quot;moss&quot;. 
 
2) Please remove the ed of &quot;wood&quot;, since you do not add any new element there that is not mentioned in the description. 
 
3) Similarly, the ed of flowers brings no real novelty apart from the colours. Please try to rephrase this ed of &quot;flowers&quot; - you could think of telling us exactly how the plants look - petal, leaves, etc, for example.

around on all sides.  
</editfirst>
    <editfirstcomments>There's one problem I see in this room.  There are no exits mentioned.  I see that you've tried to explain the directions by saying the tree can be walked around on all sides (though it may make it clearer to players if you said, in the future, &quot;can be approached from all sides&quot;), but there's one hitch.  I can't come from the north to this spot, thus making it a situation where it needs to be said that there's no exit to the north and a bit more explicit description of where one can travel (like 'approached').
 
And I agree whole-heartedly with Mira.  Shannon would love this room as I already do.  The last room I read of yours had great ideas, but was stilted and curt.  This one flows and brings the reader into this tree.  I suspect it's because you're so close to Shannon that you could actually not only 'see' the room, but 'feel' the room.  Take that ability and talent you portrayed here into all of your rooms and I'll pin a star on you that says &quot;Builder Extraordinaire.&quot; =)  `-tina

    <editsecondcomments>Lovely Petra, I have added an example of what I would do in reaction to Tina's last comment, about the exits. Please understand that this is only that, an example, so feel free to change it any way you wish. However, if you do decide to change it, please send me a note, and I'll be back in a jiffy to have one last look. Otherwise, the room is good! `-Cristina

    <editdraftcomments>Dear Don, this room is nearly flawless, except for a few tweaks.  I just 
wanted to say that the first sentence here is pure genius: gripping, 
beautiful, and extremely good to set the atmosphere.  Congratualations on 
that!  What I WOULD like you to do, however, is to go through your exit 
descriptions again and give me as powerful a phrasing for those as you did 
in that first phrase.  As it is, while everything's written in perfectly 
acceptable English, it does sound a little like a shopping list.  Relate the 
exits, make comparisons between them, etc.  Just giving an example here: 
&quot;The lush grass growing here flourishes to the northeast as well; rustling 
with any breeze, the green blades seem determined to draw the attention away 
from the thinned vegetation and bare earth to the north and east.&quot;  I know 
that when writing the exits, it's tempting to just go in each neighbouring 
room and give a small description of what you find, but with 10 seconds more 
of your time, you can make it brilliant.  I have a lot of faith in you!  
Hugs, Cristina

    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please change echo [0] to: 'A herbal scent drifts through this area on a gentle, northwestern breeze.' 
 
2) Please change echo [1] to: 'The sweet aroma of buttercups, rhododendrons, and broom flowers wafts on the air from the west.'
 
3) Please change echo [2] to: 'A wayward Snitch, perhaps a holdover from a recent Quidditch practice, tiredly flutters by, climbing up into the sky and disappearing.'
 
As a rule for this last echo, if the text that you want to write is too long, it's better to cut the sentence short with something like: '&lt;the object&gt; flutters by, its slow flight demanding some attention.' And then you add an ed describing the object. Otherwise, please try to make echoes shorter, as they are supposed to take only a minute.
 
Well done overall! I loved the Snitch echo! `-Cristina

the northwest leads through spiky grass and bushes to the figure of a 
statue.  Several strange piles of dirt mar the perfectly clipped grass to 
the east.  A statue to the southeast stands sentry over what appears to be 
dead or dying bushes.  The Hogwarts Quidditch Pitch lies southwest, and its 
inaccessible wall towers to the south.  To the west, a huge flowerbed

towers to the south.  A huge flowerbed featuring a veritable explosion of 
colours rises out of the grounds to the west like an enticing mirage.

    <editdraft>The grass in this area of the Grounds is thick and lush, making the ground 
feel spongy underfoot.  Several colorful wildflowers have sprung up through 
the grass here, a burst of colour in a vast patch of green.  A light breeze 
carries in a small swarm of ladybirds to this bit of the property, which 
land on the flowers to seek out mites and aphids.  The tidy lawn both here 
and to the north and west stands in great contrast to the grass to the east, 
which looks as if an apprentice groundskeeper had great difficulty wielding 
the trimming spell that usually keeps the Hogwarts Grounds looking so 
orderly.  A group of statues keep watch over the unkempt lawn there.  Large, 
gorgeous sunflowers to the northeast make for a visual treat but vie for 
attention with the beautiful assorted flowers to the southeast.  As if to 
balance the scales against the bountiful life all around, dying bushes 
obscure the view to the south.  The thick canopy of a grove of 
daylight-smothering trees hampers visibility to the northwest.

    <editeds>Hi! 
 
As I've just mentioned above, please make the parts aboutt he ladybirds into echoes.

    <editfirst>The grass in this area of the Grounds is thick and lush, making the (soil) 
feel spongy underfoot.  Several colorful wildflowers have sprung up 
(in-between the vegetal blades) here, a burst of colour in a vast patch of

    <editfirstcomments>Hello Don!
 
I've added suggestions to avoid repetitions, but otherwise, I love the feeling of this ground. Apart from repetitions, I'd like you to make the sentence about ladybirds into two echoes. (A light breeze carries in a small swarm of ladybirds to this bit of the property, which land on the flowers to seek out mites and aphids.)

      <desc>The ladybirds appear to be oval-shaped beetles that are approximately 10 
millimetres in length.  They are bright red in colour with black dots on the 
backs of their wings.  Several of the ladybirds have aphids clutched in 
their mandibles.  They seem to be doing a brilliant job of ridding the 
Hogwarts Grounds of pests.

    <name>* Hogwarts Wall</name>

    <desc>For a strange reason, the wind repeatedly and furiously slams into the 
rounded, weather-beaten edges of this section of the wall, as though the 
elderly stone had somehow managed to draw its never-ceasing displeasure.  
Occasionally touching the base of the high barrier is the ever-dancing 
shadow of the Forbidden Forest.  The trees writhe and scream as the 
permanent storm ravages through them, scattering fragments of twigs and 
branches all over the forest floor, while any weeds and hedges are flattened 
against the ground.  To the west of the wall lie the wrecked and torn, 
northernmost patches of vegetation that border the north of Hogsmeade 
village.  The reassuring shape of Hogwarts Castle is barely distinguishable 
above the tree tops, far to the east, while to the southeast the wall stands 
more peacefully, free of the dreadful curse of the savage current.  The 
protective barrier around the wizarding school continues northwest only to 
be engulfed in the distance by the hungry, dank woods.  
</desc>
    <editdraft>A reckless wind permanently and furiously slams into the cracked, 
weather-beaten edges of this section of the wall.  Wrapped 
claustrophobically close to the granite barrier is the Forbidden Forest, its 
conflicting scents and thrusting branches vibrant with life and anger.  In 
the constant gale, the woods move chaotically, in a macabre ballet of an 
inevitable death.  For those brave enough to attempt it, a few outlying 
stones and dead vines offer a way to descend into the hellish, eastern 
woods, or onto slightly friendlier, southeastern grounds.  On the other side 
of the wall, a dismount is impossible, as strong enchantments prevent the 
passage into the wrecked and torn northernmost patches of vegetation 
bordering Hogsmeade.  It is impossible to see almost anything here even 
during the day, as dark canopies of trees keep the sky blocked beyond them; 
only sometimes, faint traces of light penetrate from the northern and 
southern sections of the wall.

    <editeds>hello!
 
The ed is mostly golden: maybe just precise wich floor the ivy and cones lay scattered on: the wall or the Forest (I know the answer, but just so as not to confused the players...).

    <editfirstcomments>Hello dear Cris!
 
I'm suggesting a very slight change, 'cause I'm picky, but the room's really perfect. Please let me know when I can edit more ofyour wondrous work!

      <desc>Though strong and very old, not even the trees of the Forbidden Forest are 
immune to the ravaging gale that permanently blasts against them.  Some of 
the trees are huddled together in thickets, their defiance somewhat curbed 
by the wind.  Thorny hedges, pine cones, and proud ivy lie scattered across 
the ground, flattened and ripped to shreds; above, a ruffled, dark web of 
evergreen branches looms over the walls, as though the trees had thrown 
their arms around each other in an attempt to steal some warmth and comfort 
from their brethren.

    <desc>The massive, stone wall fades in comparison to the moving, breathing forest 
lining it to the west.  A particularly vicious-looking, old willow stands a 
distance away from its fellows, as if defying both them and the magnificent 
Hogwarts castle that rises on its eastern side.  Occasional reflections of 
light flash from the far south, where the contours of the Quidditch Pitch 
can barely be glimpsed.  The wall turns away from the castle to the 
northwest, into the shadows of the Forbidden Forest.  In the distance, to 
the south, stands a large, black, iron gate.

      <desc>A knobbly, temperamental willow, with scratches and marks of burns running 
all over its elderly trunk, rebelliously stands a distance away from the 
forest that darkly looms to the north side of it.  Its strong roots have 
penetrated through the thin crust of the earth around it, plunging back into 
the ground a few feet away.  The branches of the tree are very large and 
heavy with old age, but it still defiantly stands alone, gazing towards 
Hogwarts Castle like a muted, faithful guardian.

      <desc>Thick, musky scents stream from the direction of the mass of trees that is 
the Forbidden Forest.  Dark and surrounded by thickets of strong weeds, the 
innumerable oaks on the edge of the woods throw their arms greedily 
westward, while fellow trees huddle against them to the east and to the 
north, creating a nearly-impenetrable wall of tall organisms, united above 
and below by intricate webs of branches and roots.

    <editdraft>The dirt in this circular area looks slightly charred, as if the grass might 
have been burnt away.  It is dry and sandy, with only a few tough weeds 
growing in it.  Specks of quartz and mica shine brightly, peeking out from 
under their coats of grit.  A few smooth pebbles are scattered across this 
sand pit.  The Forbidden Forest looms to the east, south, and west.  To the 
southeast is a gloomy clearing, and a gnarled, violent-looking willow lies 
to the southwest.

    <editdraftcomments>Petra!  Lovely writing here, I must say :) no edits from me.  I really like 
the mica and quartz!  I could tell you some stuff about those rocks because 
I took a geology class over the summer at the community college, hehe.  But 
I won't bore you with that.  *hugs*

    <editfirstcomments>Hey, Pet.  I'm popping on here for a tiny while to give more detail on edits and vision.  =) I'm not putting this in the 'edit' area, but here in the comment area instead, as you still have a 2nd editor coming, I'm just throwing my 2 cents in.  (Don't worry; I'm not picking on you specifically, I'm doing it for all rooms written.)  So I'm not circumventing editor 2, she'll still come in and do the excellent job all these ladies do.  Additionally, I've listed points on each thing I've altered.  Okay, here I go, my altered version of your room:

Specks of quartz and mica shine brightly, peeking out from under their coats of grit.  A few smooth pebbles are scattered across this sand pit.  The Forbidden Forest looms to the east, south, and west.  To the southeast is a gloomy clearing and a gnarled, violent-looking willow lies to the southwest.`X
 
1, I joined sentence 1 &amp; 2 as the 2nd sentence was so lackluster alone.  Married into the 1st sentence gives it more oomph.  
 
2, &quot;coats of grit&quot;, not &quot;coat of grit&quot; since there are 'specks', AKA more than 1.
 
3, now, the 2nd editor of this room may not agree with me, so feel free to change it if you feel it should be or your 2nd editor says to, but I changed &quot;the sand pit&quot; to &quot;this sand pit&quot; since it's 'this' area you're speaking of.  To me, and it may only be me (I'm pretty thick), 'the' sand pit makes it sound like there is a sand pit inside this area, as a separate feature, and not that this particular room is the sand pit itself.  But that's just me. =)
 
4, I altered the last 3 sentences detailing the exits as they all start the same way.  An excellent job of giving more detail than 'the exits are ', but it is still a bit rote since the same phrase is used in 3 consecutive sentences.
 
Pet, you have some lovely ideas.  The charred ground, the quartz and mica peeking, the delicious description of the willow, and giving detail on where the exits lie are awesome.  The one aspect I think you need to work on is making your prose a bit more poetic.  You're a great writer; I know that.  But you seem to be keeping yourself back a bit.  Since a majority of the sentences written are short, it makes the desc read like it's choppy and stilted.  We're talking about the HW Grounds here- flowing earth with long lines of vision as opposed to blocked off pieces of land.  Your extremely funny stories of 'RPing' on the forum show me that you have the talent and ability to write in extended lines, like these grounds stretch.  Try not to check off each detail like it's on a check list, but rather write them like your stories- detailed (like you have now) but also flirty, playful, and artful.  You have awesome ideas to illustrate, just take your ideas and let them grow.  =D

    <editsecondcomments>I love not having anything to do when I am editing! As Mira and Tina have done such a cracking job at editing this room, all I did was add an extra comma in the last sentence, for the sake of clarity. Personally, I stand by Tina's decision of replacing 'the sand pit' by 'this sand pit'. Otherwise, nothing to say but thank you so much for all your efforts! `-Cristina

    <editdraftcomments>Great desc, carole!  :) I almost giggled when I read &quot;not known to lift 
anyone's spirit...&quot;  Hehe, that's a good one.  Just a few tweaks here and 
there is all I did.  I've noticed you tend to put your adjectives after your 
subject.  That usually only happens in other languages.  In english, we put 
them before.  (like you know how in spanish, you say coat red?  But in 
english, you would say a red coat.)  :) hope that makes sense.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1. Please change echo number 1 to: 'A small, unidentified creature cowers off into the forest nearby.'
 
2. Please add a full stop after echo number 4.
 
EDS:
 
1. Please add 'weapon' to the ed of 'scythe'.
 
2. I've edited all your eds. Nothing major, just minor tweaks. Where I used brackets, it means you are free to choose a different wording or ignore the edit altogether. please, however, notify me of your decision.
 
This room is lovely, in a horrid, skeleton-scythe-containing way. Huggles to you! `-Cristina

    <editsecondcomments>Most of this desc was excellently written, lovely Carole. I have only tweaked here and there a few things that sounded a bit strange to me. In the last sentence, I took the liberty of changing 'as long as its body' to 'nearly as long as its body', since otherwise, why would the skeleton be hunching over it? The rest is golden here! `-Cristina

      <desc>Upon closer inspection, the skeleton fortunately appears to be made of 
whitish stone, rather than once-living, human bones.  The statue is entirely 
bare; not a bit of clothing, nor any other adornment, breaks the line.  
Though not even the tendons are sculpted, the bones are nonetheless 
magically held at the proper distance they would naturally be in a living, 
breathing human being.  The lack of even basic details upon the sculpture 
makes it impossible to tell what the gender of the skeleton might be.  From 
the feet of the stone skeleton sprout paths, which hurriedly scurry away 
from the menace of the statue's scythe and its long, threatening blade.

    <extradesc>
      <desc>The scythe's blade is forged out of silver, so that it contrasts profusely 
with the black handle.  The sharp end of the weapon is oriented so that the 
flat side is towards the skeleton's feet; there, in this most impractical 
place to look at, a rectangle is shallowly carved into the metal, and in its 
centre are the Roman numerals 'XIII'.  From the handle, the blade sprouts 
straight for about three inches before curving up in a smooth, lethal point.

    <extradesc>
      <desc>The scythe is held upright by the skeleton, with the sharp blade down 
against the ground.  The handle is carved out of a dark wood; the 
highly-polished finish of the material indicates that this is probably 
ebony.  This black component contrasts harshly with the whiteness of the 
stone skeleton, whose metacarpus and phalanges are lovingly wrapped around 
it.  Both ends of the ebony rod are shaped like mounds surrounding a dimple, 
so that the handle as a whole looks like an elongated version of the cliched 
bone.

    <desc>The flower beds from the south and the east converge on this spot and stop 
on each side of a large, hollow, eight foot by eight foot, concrete bench.  
In the centre, a very tall topiary reaches sixteen feet tall at its tip.  In 
season, the ground at the base of the topiary is covered with emerald-green 
grass.  The topiary, always covered with leaves in season or out, is 
sculpted with a unique, modern style.  The base spirals around itself and 
branches into sharp, curved sword-like appendages before swooping back in 
towards the centre of the base with perfectly round arms.  The arms cross 
each other through the middle until it branches symmetrically downward into 
a violent point that almost reaches the ground, on its way back up it 
spirals around itself four times before looping and knotting itself at the 
very tip-top.

    <editeds>I loved the echoes, they're pleasant.  Just 2 things: Echo 0, please remove

comma after &quot;topiary&quot;, as it is not needed.  
</editeds>
    <editfirst>. Hey Russel!  I really, really liked this room.  And that's saying something 
as I'm not a big fan of the outdoors.  Just a few things, mostly grammatical 
mistakes Sentence 1, please add a comma after &quot;large&quot; and &quot;eight foot by 
eight foot&quot;, as you need the commas to separate the adjectives.  Also, the 
last part (&quot;with its centre hollowed out&quot;) is a bit lengthy.  When something 
is 'hollow' it means the middle is missing, so explaining that takes a lot 
of unneeded words.  This desc is already fairly long, so I would cut that 
and add &quot;hollow&quot; after &quot;long&quot;, so it reads: &quot;..  Each side of a long, 
hollow, eight foot by eight foot, concrete bench.&quot;  Sentence 3, the wording 
of this is kind of awkward.  Move &quot;in season&quot; to the beginning of the 
sentence and add a comma after it, so that it reads: &quot;In season, the ground 
at the&quot;Sentence 4, &quot;leave&quot; should be &quot;leaves&quot;, as it is plural :P Also, 
please add a comma after &quot;unique&quot; to separate the adjectives.  Sentence 5, 
Add a comma after &quot;sharp&quot;, and &quot;curved&quot; to separate the adjectives.  Also, 
&quot;sword-like&quot; should be hyphenated.  Sentence 6, you misspelled &quot;each other&quot; 
(it is 2 words), &quot;through&quot; (there is no 't' at the end), &quot;symmetrically&quot; 
(there are 2 M's), and &quot;around&quot; (it is a 'd', not a 'g').  Also, &quot;downwards&quot; 
should be &quot;downward&quot;.  Finally, &quot;tip-top&quot; should be hyphenated.  Sentence 7, 
you should not tell them it is a nice place to be, you have all ready shown 
them in the writing.  This sentence isn't really needed.  Otherwise, an 
amazing room!  It was very creative, bravo.  &lt;33 Jess

    <editeds>Your echoes are perfect, sweet, and I absolutely loved the star one: it was 
so precious and cute.  However, your EDs are not nearly long enough.  One, 
short sentence is not enough.  You can describe the rock as &quot;granite&quot; in the 
desc, and likewise you can mention bugs on the lichen in the desc.  EDs are 
only for longer descriptions of certain objects.  So you should either 
expand them by a few sentences (maybe describe what the rock formation looks 
like, color, etc), or just cut them completely and add the extra adjectives 
to your desc.  Either way, it's up to you.  Your echoes are adorable, 
though, and I'm impressed you got them completely right the first time 
around!!

    <editfirst>Hey Don.  This is a really good room.  I really liked it, it's creative and 
well-written (and you have startling good grammar).  There are just a few, 
small changes I'd like you to make: Sentence one: the word &quot;formation&quot; makes 
it seem like some sort of statue, and statues can't be &quot;narrow&quot; perse.  Be 
more specific or change &quot;narrow&quot; to something like &quot;small&quot;, &quot;miniscule&quot;, 
&quot;tall&quot;, or something else you meant.  J Also, add a comma after &quot;ground&quot;, 
please.  Sentence two, this is a bit confusing because of &quot;its&quot;.  Try 
something like, &quot;.  Grows on the northern face of the granite.&quot;  Sentence 3: 
&quot;favorite&quot; should be spelled the british way, &quot;favourite&quot;.  Sentence 4: 
Please remove the comma after &quot;visible&quot;, as it is unnecessary.  Also, you 
didn't finish this sentence, it's jus left hanging.  Try something along the 
lines of: &quot;..  The Forbidden Forest is barely discernable.&quot;  Sentences 5 &amp; 6 
are rather short, so combine them to make something like &quot;Closer to the 
south, a large statue stands on a pedestal and in the horizon jus t beyond 
it is the merry fence of the Quidditch Pitch.&quot;  Also, you haven't added any 
exits directly (just the directions you can see in), so I would suggest a 
final sentence something like, &quot;The inviting grounds stretch out in every 
direction from this piece of earth.&quot;  Otherwise, an excellent, excellent 
room!  Keep it up.  Xoxo, Jess

      <desc>The rock formation is ruddy in colour at the top but grey nearer its base.  
The granite's surface lacks any jagged edges, having been rubbed smooth from 
many years of students climbing, sitting, and leaning on it.  The lichen is 
grey-green in colour and is infested with mites, spiders, and slugs.  The 
edges of the lichen patch have been nibbled away, possibly by a passing 
deer.

    <desc>This patch of rich soil is just south of the sweeping drive leading from the 
western gates to the eastern castle entrance.  Far away to the north, the 
top of the greenhouses is visible; beyond that, the dark presence of the 
Forbidden Forest.  Closer to the south is the merry fence of the Quidditch 
Pitch.  Eight paths are carved into the black, fertile earth, winding in 
every directions, and many footprints are embedded in the soft ground of the 
patches.  An earthy, pungent smell rises from the ground and surrounds a 
statue of a woman.

      <desc>This statue depicts a woman balancing serenely on top of an earth globe.  
Her long, straight mane grazes this sphere as well.  Her face is a bit 
angular and blunt, with a square jaw that bespeaks of strength, both 
physical and mental.  Her body is in keeping with this impression, despite 
the obvious feminine form.  Her arms and shoulders are muscled, but still 
retain a roundness to them.  Her full breast, large hips, and curvy bottom 
are quite motherly, while her toned tummy gives her silhouette an enticing 
hour-glass shape.  Her dress is form-fitting, but not skin-tight; the plain, 
sturdy material hangs from her shoulder in a deep-blue envelope ridden with 
specks of green, brown, and yellow.

most other directions, this area is occupied by an unusual topiary.  From 
here, it is possible to see the tree tops of the Forbidden Forrest, obscured 
slightly by the northerly greenhouses.  Hogwarts itself rises in the east 
while the south holds the Quidditch Pitch.  A path of light grey pebbles 
stretches from east to west, encircling the sculpted bushes and several 
benches of white marble that rest alongside the shrubs.  During the warmer 
parts of the year, small, white wildflowers dot the verdant grass, while 
delicate, pale flowers cover the topiary.  During the autumn, miniscule 
berries, blood red in colour, replace the flowers on the topiary; they dot 
the grass as much as the bushes and it is impossible to walk on the grass 
without stepping on one.  No matter what season, a sense of peacefulness and 
tranquility emanates from this patch of land, though its origin is not 
discernable.

    <editdraftcomments>WOW brad, this is a really awesome room.  You have very good detail and 
description abilities!  Just a few minor changes here.  Don't forget to use 
british spelling, (grey), and try not to always use the same phrasing (to 
the north, to the west, to the east).  :) 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>I did edit your stones and marble eds, but the other 2 are just lovely.  
Your echoes seem fine, except for your #3 because you have people playing 
quidditch from noon 7am.  Students have to go into the castle at evening so 
you need to change the ending time to like, 7pm or something :) thanks so 
much!  `-mira

      <desc>Growing only about waist-high, this topiary is rather unusual; the bushes 
have been shaped into three, hollowed-out equilateral triangles that form a 
circle, sharing the point in the centre.  This centre point is slightly 
higher than the edges of the bushes, formed into a pyramid pointing skyward. 
 The shrubs themselves consist mostly of holly, though both yew and 
elderberry branches wind through the bushes too.  Patches of lavender 
dominate the open areas in the centre of the triangle-shaped hedges; 
however, golden snapdragons are scattered throughout the wash of purple.

      <desc>Stretching from east to west, this path of pebbles forms a circle around the 
sculpted topiary and benches.  Most of the pebbles are a light grey, though 
several stones ranging from pure alabaster to dark granite lay scattered 
about.  The stones seem to be laid out very purposefully; they form a clear 
linear boundary between the grass and the path.  Not a single blade of grass 
or weed grows through the stones, nor does any of the gravel stray into the 
verdant vegetation.

The rune itself is a line with two short lines protruding diagonally outward 
from near the end, suggestive of a broom.

    <desc>A small, raised hill occupies this space of land, sloping upward toward the 
south and downward in all other directions.  Various statues and sculptures 
surround the knoll in every other direction save the north; here, the track 
leading from the gate to the castle stretches from the northeast to the 
northwest.  During the warmer months, the grass is a brilliant verdant 
colour.  Even during the colder parts of the year, the grass holds this 
colour, though it is very faint and pale.  Several slate paths run from the 
cardinal directions towards a fountain residing on the top of the hill; the 
paths transform into steps when the slope of the hill warrants it.  The 
smell of rain lingers in the air while the whisper of a babbling brook can 
be heard very faintly.

    <editsecondcomments>Lovely Carole, I like the fact that you give us some bearings out of this place. However, I've changed the turn of sentence 2 so that it doesn't sound so much like sentence 1. I've also added some stuff to sentence 3, though it's yours to change or refuse altogether. Do let me know which of the two you choose though. Just minor tweaks besides this. Love the scenery, can't wait to see what's on the pedestal. `-Cristina

      <desc>The pedestal is a fluted cylinder made out of bronze; the cavities are 
azure-painted, as is the seemingly empty platter.  Upon closer examination, 
however, a tiny statue of a Jobberknoll bird is revealed.  The azure 
feathers blend almost completely with the socle, except for the bronze 
specks on them.  The long beak and sharp, though short, talons are equally 
bronze-coloured.  Between the serene blue and the austere bronze, the statue

    <desc>To the north, the Hogwarts Driveway is slightly screened by thin trees, but 
accessible through three paths to the northeast, north, and northwest.  A 
western lanes leads directly under the outer wall while its eastern 
counterpart looks towards the distant castle.  Paths of deep-blue pebbles 
trace their way to the south, southeast, and southwest through light-blue 
grass.  The yon Quidditch Pitch stands south.  Where the eight dirt paths 
meet, in the middle of a cleared circle, a female statue is set on a small 
socle.  Both statue and socle are made of deep-blue stone.  The woman, 
though of a petite frame, stands tall and proud, facing north.  Even her 
foot-tall, pointed wizard hat and its kempt feather are upright and as stiff 
as Justice; so is the raven on her right shoulder, its sharp claws digging 
into her thick, leather epaulette.  The rest of her robes are of similarly 
tough and thick material, and include two elbow-long, leather gloves as well 
as a cloak embroidered with the Ravenclaw crest.

    <desc>Three paths lead through a thin line of trees to northeast, north, and 
northwest unto the faintly-visible Hogwarts driveway.  Two more lanes run 
towards the outer, eastern wall and to the distant, western castle Three 
other trails slither through the green grass and to the southeast, south, 
and southwest, in the general direction of the Quidditch Pitch.  In the 
centre, all these white, gravel roads meet into a circular area occupied by 
a silver-grey stone statue of a man.  His wrinkled features look somewhat 
monkey-like under his small hat, with his overhanging eyebrows, flat nose, 
and heavy jaw.  His old-fashioned, sweeping robes are emblazoned on the back 
with the Slytherin crest.  His ancient body, facing north, is slouched so 
much that the man's long, thin beard brushes the bloated toad sitting on the 
statue's socle.  In fact, he is hunched over protectively as he cradled to 
his chest, next to a small locket, a just hatched egg; a small serpent rears 
its still shell-covered head out.

    <desc>The wall here guards the school grounds against a sweep of rough hillside 
stretching up to meet a mountain range wreathed in mist.  Wiry tufts of moor 
grass and the odd outcropping of rock punctuate the slope.  This is clearly 
a well-traveled area, as even the stones of the path have been rutted with 
generations of feet.  The top of the wall levels out for an armspan or so.  
The surface texture changes abruptly from cragged to smooth, almost 
polished, creating a noticeable concave patch.  The vertical surface below 
is horizontally grooved.  Countless students have sat here, their heels 
kicking at the granite surface as they contemplated the view.  The Driveway 
is northeast and the wall continues to the south.

    <copyright>Copyright © 2004-2010  Project Legilimensia</copyright>
    <desc>Overseeing large patches of mountain grass, this wall appears as an 
impenetrable barrier between Hogsmeade and Hogwarts.  Its stone surface is 
an interesting, dark-grey colour that contrasts with the bright plants 
around it; the stone is chipped in places, with edges occasionally rounded 
by weathering wind.  Mirroring its granite structure, but magnifying it to 
gigantic proportions, Hogwarts Castle is visible far into eastern distance.  
Two large doors tower above a stone pathway that connects the school with a 
large, iron gate standing to the north.  To the southeast, out of patches of 
short grass and trees rise the Quidditch stands, surrounding a large arena, 
marked by six round hoops.  The cool whisper of water is accompanied 
sometimes by a shimmering, luminous reflection that draws the attention 
further to the south.  To the west of the wall lies the village of 
Hogsmeade, side roads spreading like tentacles from the High Street.  A turn 
in the wall leads southwest, in a wide circle around the castle.

      <desc>A stone pathway reaches out from underneath the magnificent Castle, cutting 
straight through the grass until it reaches the tall, dark, iron gate 
leading into Hogsmeade.  On both sides of the alley are grass and small 
flowers, with little mounds rising every once in a while to break the 
monotony of the plains.  The surface of the road itself, however, appears 
clean and level.

      <desc>Like a Phoenix with outstretched wings, Hogwarts castle rises in the 
distance, its walls made of solid, dark-grey stone that makes it look 
reassuringly-impenetrable.  An aura of peace hangs low around its 
innumerable floors, while turrets and towers pierce the sky in a gesture of 
fierce pride and perhaps defiance.  Ivy climbs steadily up the vertical 
surface, erupting from under or through classroom windows, creating green 
and silvery webs that cover the walls protectively.

      <desc>The village is spread to the southwest, a sleepy giant with arms 
outstretched northwards, slithering and turning between houses and patches 
of trees.  A rather large manor is visible about halfway between the wall 
and the High Street, painted in severe-white.  Surrounding the manor are 
patches of trees and a tidy garden.  To the south, the dirt paths that lead 
to the north of the village become paved streets in various states of 
cleanness.

      <desc>Large stands surround the Quidditch pitch in a wide rectangle.  Six tall 
hoops stand slightly above the top of the stadium, three on the north, and 
three on the south side of the field.  The middle hoop is slightly higher up 
than the other two; its rounded edges are slightly dented in places, where 
Bludgers or over-enthusiastic players have struck it.

    <desc>A vista of deep-green surrounds this area on almost all sides.  Between the 
scent-filled, thick grove to the west are fragments of a grey outer wall; to 
the north, atop a gentle hillock, crosses the sweeping drive that leads from 
two massive gates to the eastern Hogwarts Castle.  To the south stands the 
Quidditch Pitch.  The light, silvery, marble ground of this patch contrasts 
with its dark, grass-filled surroundings.  The black lines in the marble, 
as well as many wide crevices and thin cracks, weave a dark, angular web.  
Only the eight paths slithering away from this patch are exempted from 
creases and wrinkles.  Against this deserted, lunar background rears up the 
huge statue of a Basilisk.

    <editdraft>Close to the west is the outer wall and to the north the sweeping drive 
leading to the eastern Hogwarts castle.  To the south stands the Quidditch 
Pitch.  Silvery rock makes out the ground; many wide crevices and thin 
cracks weave a dark, angular web.  Only the eight paths slithering out the 
path are exempt of lines.  Against that lunar background rears up the huge 
statue of a Basilisk.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Another great statue, carole.  Just the usual few corrections on grammar.  
On a side note, if you try and read your writing outloud to yourself, you 
can tell if your word choice is right or not, especially regarding singular 
vs.  Plural stuff.  That might help you understand which one is correct :) I 
do like your comparison of the grounds to a web though, that's cool!  Hehe.  

</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1. Please change echo number 0 to: &quot;The vivid-green scales on the Basilisk statue rustle loudly against one another.&quot;
 
2. Please change echo number 1 to: &quot;The wind hisses and whistles through the cracks on the ground.&quot;
 
3. Please change echo number 2 to: &quot;The statue snarls, shaking its ugly head, apparently unaware that it is made of stone.&quot;
 
COMMENTS:
 
These echoes are awesome, but please remember that the reader has only read the desc until one of the echoes pops up. They might not even read the ed. Please make sure they know exactly to which cracks and which beast you are referring to.
 
EDS:
 
1. I've edited your ed a bit. The reason for it was mostly that the wording was a bit quantitative - it's great that you tell us so much about the basilisk, but I added a few details like the fact that it is a snake, since that's one of the first thing one would notice in a statue, I think. Otherwise, most of this was great. I took out the rustling scales since you have an echo to that effect.
 
As to the problem with the foot-long. It's true, it is a composite adjective, hence my always marking it with hyphens. Therefore, just for certainty, I would write it like:  five-foot-long, rather than five-foot long. If you wish to drop the hyphens, it should be five feet long or five feet in length.
 
Love how much work you're doing for us, Carole, sweetness, thank you so much! `-Cristina

    <editfirst>Close to the west is the outer wall, and to the north, the sweeping drive, 
leading to the eastern Hogwarts (C)astle.  To the south stands the Quidditch 
Pitch.  Silvery rock(s) make out the ground; many wide crevices and thin 
cracks weave a dark, angular web.  Only the eight paths slithering out (to) 
the path are exempt of lines.  Against (the) lunar background rears up the 
huge statue of a Basilisk.  
</editfirst>
    <editfirstcomments>about the ed: I'm somewhat confused with measures. When you say &quot;something is several-foot long&quot;, isn't the whole &quot;several-foot long&quot; considered one adjective, so that &quot;foot&quot; is invariable? Whereas in &quot;smthg measures several feet in length&quot;, &quot;foot&quot; is obviously put in plural forms? I'm honestly lost here.

    <editsecondcomments>Lovely Carole, though there is close-to-nothing grammatically wrong with this room, I have suggested a bit of rephrasing. The reason for this is partly the fact that I have edited now five or six rooms that sound pretty much the same in structure, and I think it would be even better if we had some diversity, and partly the fact that I think the desc is a bit barren. Although factually sound, it lacks some of the great atmosphere that you generally use so well. Of course, please feel free to rephrase the stuff I added in any way you like, but please do consider altering this room a bit so that it sounds less dry. `-Cristina

      <desc>The Basilisk statue measures fifty feet in total and its muscular, serpent's 
body rears up to forty feet.  The head is five-foot-long by itself; the maw 
opens wide, full of sharp, plainly-showing, foot-long fangs.  Between the 
vivid-green, stone scales, and the silver ground upon which the sculpture 
stands, this enormous snake echoes the colours of Slytherin house.

    <desc>The rich, brown, fertile ground slopes at a fourty-five degree angle here.  
The lowest point of the land is to the west, while the highest is to the 
east.  At the top of the slope is a dirt circle; one blue flower grows in 
the centre.  Snaking from the dirt circle are three dirt paths leading 
northeast, southeast, and east.  A mound of dirt, growing from eroding soil 
coming from the top of the slope, has collected at the western end of the 
land.  Three more paths connect to this mound, leading off to the northwest, 
southwest, and west.  A path of rubble and rocks crosses the middle of the 
slope, connecting the northern and southern parts of the land.

    <desc>From the east and the general direction of the castle, the grass-covered 
ground is quite flat.  However, one third of the distance westward, it 
starts to slope abruptly.  In the middle of the ridge, a pale statue of a 
man stands precariously.  He looks like he ran over the short distance of 
flat terrain to gain speed right before jumping off the crest, but then was 
quite suddenly statufied: only the toes of one winged sandal remain on the 
ground and his arms are outstretched, the left one holding a caduceus.  His 
roman toga is billowing in the wind and the little wings on his helmet are 
spread out, to keep him airborne - only he never took off.  Along the ridge, 
two paths lead north and south.  Three more wind from the statue to the 
northeast, east, and southeast.  On the western side of the patch, the slope 
levelled out again.  There a circle of dust, is cleared among the grass, a 
landing spot of sort whence radiate three more trails to the northwest, 
west, and southwest.

    <desc>The eastern side of this patch of aquamarine grass slopes very gently in an 
upward curve.  Halfway to the west, it suddenly caves inward, in a rounded, 
almost vertical plunge.  This dip eventually levels out on the western limit 
of the patch and into three trails to the northwest, west, and southwest.  
Surfing the daisy-brimmed ridge of teal lawn, emerges a white statue of a 
woman.  The heavy material of her toga moulds her body so intimately that it 
looks like it was poured over her rather than draped.  A dainty belt weaved 
out of myrtle circles her tapered waist, highlighting her buxom figure.  
More myrtle leaves adorn her hair, as well as small scallop shells.  From 
where she rides the crest, five paths wave to the north, northeast, east, 
southeast, and south.

    <desc>In the eastern shadow of the castle, the statue of a man stands at 
attention, his 9-foot spear sharpened and ready.  His white, marble skin is 
covered with bronze armour from head to toe: a red-crested helmet continued 
down on his beardless cheeks, and is engraved on the forehead with an 
arrowed circle.  The breastplate is polished like a mirror and greaves adorn 
his muscled shins.  A mid-thigh tunic is worn underneath, as well as 
sandals.  A scabbard at his waist holds a short sword, and his left arm 
supports a round, bowl-shaped, 3-foot wide shield.  The statue's marble 
pedestal is set in the middle of the barren patch of earth; from there 
radiate eight dirt paths.

    <desc>This place lies west of the flower beds lining the castle's wall.  Jasmine 
flowers invade this patch.  One of the climbing shrubs is wrapping up around 
the statue of a woman standing in the middle of the patch, giving her dress 
a delicate, live pattern of star-shaped flowers.  Further south is the 
Quidditch Pitch and even further west is the outer wall.  To the north, the 
cobbled way from the grounds gates to the castle entrance is faintly 
visible.  Eight paths allow to visit any of theses places.

      <desc>There are three sorts of jasmine cultivated in this patch.  The 
pinkish-white stars of Jasminum Polyanthum, the bigger, white stars of 
Jasminum Officinale, and the tight, multi-layered corollas of Jasminum 
Sambac.  The first two are decorative, specking the dark-green of the shrubs 
and leaves with their bright colours, and of use in perfumery; the third is 
used to make jasmine tea.  Hence, a heady, gentle scent lingers in this 
patch.

      <desc>The statue is made of a softly-sparkling, pinkish, quartzose sandstone; a 
quartz star is set on her forehead.  The carved dress is most peculiar: a 
thin band of silver circles her neck and from it, a single band of material 
fanes out towards the biceps, leaving most of her shoulder nude.  Her back 
is also mostly open to perusal: the material straps of her arm are attached 
to underneath bracelets as well as to her dress front, right under the 
breast.  A thin band of silver arches on her tummy, drawing, together with 
the neck and arms bands, a five-pointed star.  On her naked back, a 
rectangular place is carved shallowly, bearing the letters 'XVII'.  The 
skirt is simpler: numerous, pointed panes are sown together and reach to her 
ankles; a shrub of jasmine adds its own pinkish stars to it, while its 
dark-green leaves and stems offer a sharp contrast.

      <desc>The paths are narrow and straight.  They are cobbled with the same, pinkish, 
sparkling sandstone as the statue and cut sharply against the dark-green 
background of the jasmine shrubs surrounding them.  The cobbles are set in a 
pattern of five-pointed stars and rhombi.

    <desc>The rocky ground slopes up very gently from all directions and culminates in 
a very low-rising mound, right in the centre of the patch.  From it extend 
eight paths towards the eastern castle, southern Quidditch pitch, and 
western outer wall; on it is set a high, ivory throne carved to resemble 
clouds.  There sits a tall statue of a man.  His abundant, curly hair leaves 
his brow completely free, but is prolonged by an equally abundant and curly 
beard.  On his forehead is a sign in the likeness of a &quot;4&quot;.  In his left 
hand, he holds a bolt of lightning, while he props his exposed torso on his 
right one, which leans on the armrest.  A cloth is draped over his lap and 
legs; there lies a discarded sceptre.  An eagle stands at his feet, eyes 
alert.

    <desc>The ground slopes gently to the east of this patch, in the direction of the 
Hogwarts Outer Wall.  A solitary, solid-gold statue of a man beams from its 
pedestal, surrounded by buttercups and daisies; the occasional, looming 
shadow of the distant Hogwarts Castle generously cradles the heavy sculpture 
and the eight paths that stream from it in all cardinal directions.  Two 
laurel branches are tied in a vegetal crown upon the statue's head, leaving 
the midpoint of its brow open to examination.  Upon this small space shines 
a small symbol - a circle with a dot in its centre.  The sculpted man is 
wearing a simple, sleeveless, knee-length tunic, and a belt circles his 
cocked hips.  On his back rests a quiver of arrows and his hands hold a bow. 
 At his sandaled feet lie a lyre on one side and the severed head of a 
python on the other.

    <editdraftcomments>YAY FOR DAISIES!!!!!!!!  People should write daisies in every one of their 
rooms!  *stamps foot*.  Ok, you get an A for putting in daisies :) I put in 
2 commas, and changed a part of your last sentence just a wee bit.  Thank 
you for rearranging your rooms like I suggested too, hehe.

    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1. YOur echoes are perfect. No edits there.
 
EDS:
 
1. Please remove 'statue' from your keywords, since the ed does not concern the statue.
 
2. I edited the ED and took out the hint of Roman numerals, since I smell a quest and that would be a bit too easy. If you do want to keep it though, please do. Otherwise, golden room! `-Cristina

    <editsecondcomments>Loveliest Carole, I've only tweaked your desc here and there, though I think the most significant part that I altered was your second sentence, which was muddled to my eyes. I hope you agree with the rephrasing, but don't hesitate to thwack me if you think I'm talking nonsense. I love that you described the statue in the main desc here, because it forms a variation with your usual style. Lovely! `-Cristina

    <desc>The ground slopes westward gently for two-thirds of the patch of earth then 
drops off abruptly.  The minute cliff thus delineated is made of a black, 
shiny obsidian and the dark stone is mottled with veins of different metals 
and spotted with brute, uncut gems of all sizes and colours.  In the centre 
of the cliff face, a small grotto is carved, where the statue of a man sits 
on a dark throne.  On each side of the grotto, a thick ladder of ivy allows 
to climb up and down.  The thin layer of earth on top of the cliff and at 
its bottom is as black as obsidian, though obviously lacklustre, and gives 
off a rich odour.  Skimming the shallow soil on the edge of the cliff, a 
path runs from the north to the south and the Quidditch Pitch.  From right 
atop the grotto three other lanes start off from this north-to-south path 
and head northeast, east, and southeast, towards the castle.  Finally, from 
the grotto's mouth radiates three other trails to the northwest, west, and 
southwest, towards the outer wall.

      <desc>The statue and throne are carved out of the same obsidian that makes up the 
cliff face.  A crown, woven out of cypress, circles the man's straight hair. 
 In the middle of his forehead, right under the crown, is a bizarre sign: it 
looks like a &quot;Y&quot;, with a crossbar in the middle of its vertical line and a 
circle at the foot of this same line.  His thin lips are contorted in a 
bored sneer above his pointed bear.  He is wearing an ankle-long toga, which 
covers only one shoulder and a belt; in his lap rests a helmet, made out of 
dog skin and a sceptre.  At his sandaled feet, sleeps a three-headed dog.

    <desc>The slope goes west smoothly, angling down for about half of the patch; then 
it falls down into a minute cliff face before resuming its gentle downward 
movement.  The cliff is curved inwards in a crescent; it outlines another 
crescent since it tampered out of the ground on each side and rises in a 
vertical arc.  Standing before the middle of the natural stonewall is the 
statue of a woman.  From her feet radiate three paths, to the northwest, 
west, and southwest, and behind her thick ivy provides a way up besides 
walking around the whole cliff face.  From the top of the cliff, where the 
ivy touches up, run five more lanes through the short grass to the north, 
northeast, east, southeast, and south.

      <desc>A silver crescent on a silver band, its points turned upwards, rests on the 
statue?  S forehead.  Her wavy hair, cut at the jaw, leaves her neck and 
shoulders nude.  The silver crescent motif is carried over twice more.  The 
first one is centred on her cleavage.  From it, a first band of pleated 
material wraps around her biceps and back, flaring down into a ankle-long 
cloak, before coming back around and wrapping anew around the crescent.  
Another, larger band wounds from the silver adornment around her breast 
leaving naked her flat, muscled tummy; said tummy bears a rectangular, 
shallow carving with the letters 'XVIII' written.  The crescent points are 
capped with small spheres so as to prevent the material to slide off.  The 
second one is in the centre of her skirt's girth.  Said skirt is made out of 
the same pleated material.  The front reaches only to above her knees, 
letting see her nice calves and bare feet; the pointed back reaches to her 
fine ankles.  In her right hand is a bow, and in her left an arrow.

    <desc>The orchard is large and full of mysterious trees.  Their branches sway as 
their fruits randomly change in size and colour, irrespective of seasons and 
weather.  The grass carpeting the ground is tall and tan.  It rolls like a 
stormy sea, even in the absence of any wind.  The leaves of the trees are 
lush and green, yet they periodically drop to the ground, rolling like tiny 
boats in the ocean of grass.  All around hangs the fresh scent of growth.  
Far to the east stands the magnificent structure of Hogwarts Castle.  The 
Quidditch Pitch, surrounded by large, banner-clad stands, rises to the 
southeast.  The orchard stretches to the west, while a lush park reaches out 
in all other directions.

    <editdraftcomments>Ooh how cool!  Chanterelles!  Fancy.  :) though I do not like mushrooms, 
hehe.  I made 3 teeny tiny adjustments.  Made A An, put in a comma, and made 
carpets singular :) great work, carole!  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>I've edited all 5 of your eds, though most are tiny things, and I really 
like your echoes!  But #0 should be lite, not light :P as light refers to... 
 Well, light, and you want lite, which is the amount :) also odor should be 
odour, british spelling please!  And #3 has some singular/plural mistakes.  
It should read: The pendulous flowers on the trees raise up their heads and 
emit a lovely trumpet ensemble.  :) that's all from me, great work carole!

In fact, there is no button or hole to diversify the sound.  On the bell, 
almost completely against the lower thigh, a shallow rectangle is carved 
out, and inside is the letters &quot;XX&quot;.

      <desc>Black chanterelles are also known as trumpets of the dead.  The &quot;horns&quot; are 
dark-grey, while the feet are light-yellow: this carries over the grove's 
theme of black and yellow.  The trumpets are known for coming rather late in 
the mushroom season, earning themselves the name of winter mushrooms.  
However, the trees in this grove are native to subtropical areas: some magic 
probably intervenes to allow both of the plants to grow at the same time, 
even if the moist soil is ideal for mushroom growing.  Especially as the 
chanterelles can be found throughout the year, and thus are a staple of 
Hogwarts' Cooking.

      <desc>The ten-foot-to-forty-foot high Brugmansia are also known as &quot;Angel's 
Trumpets&quot; (altough they share this nickname with the related genus Datura).  
The plant owes this name to the large (up to a foot and a half long and a 
foot wide at the open extremity), trumpet-like flowers it bears.  The trees 
in this grove all bear saffron, vivid flowers, thus reinforcing the yellow 
theme in the area; only the tender-green, wide leaves betrays the general 
pattern.  The flowering lasts all year long and winter mushrooms can be 
found near the subtropical trees.  Clearly, some kind of magic is at work, 
especially to ward off any frost, since that is what the Brugmansia fears 
most.  Other than that, the growing conditions are perfect, with part-shade 
in the morning, courtesy of the outer wall, and full sun from midday till 
sunset, and a fertile, moist soil.

    <desc>A tall, solid wall widens its grasp around the Hogwarts Grounds as it moves 
north and southwest.  Its top is smooth and rounded by harsh weather, while 
its base is chipped and dirty.  From its thirty feet height, the barrier 
towers above patches of grass, littered in spring and summer with 
multi-coloured flowers.  Southward, the magnificent stands around the 
Quidditch Pitch draw the eye with their perfect, rectangular shape.  Two 
symmetric groups of three, tall hoops barely emerge at the northern and 
western extremities of the arena.  Further into the distance stands 
Hogwarts, its many towers and turrets piercing the sky defiantly.  On the 
inaccessible, western side of the wall stretches a sea of roads with little 
islands of trees and houses, and small rivulets streaming outwards as dirt 
paths.  This is the only all-magical settlement in Britain, the village of 
Hogsmeade.

      <desc>Two groups of three hoops each, the middlemost taller than the two, stand 
out into the distance, upon what appear to be golden poles.  Hundreds of 
seats rise in the air, their tops just underneath the level of the highest 
hoop.  During Quidditch matches, these are filled with people wearing the 
colours of any one of the four Hogwarts houses: red, green, blue, or yellow. 
 Without spectators, the pitch is oddly silent, but beautiful, catching any 
light from the sky and breaking the rays in millions of shining shards of 
colour.

the High Street, which stands out like a marble statue amidst heaps of dust. 
 Houses of all shapes and sizes are visible in the distance, generally 
surrounded by gardens and patches of trees.  A few lonely paths erupt away 
from the busy area of paved roads to the south, one running parallel to the 
stone barrier and heading towards Hogwarts, beneath an iron gate.

    <desc>Patternless patches of trees and low grass grow between the sturdy wall and 
Hogwarts Castle.  Their colour varies from the fresh green of perennial 
species to a dark-grey hue where they are shaded by the shadows of large 
stands placed high around the Quidditch Pitch.  During most of the year, 
flowers of all colours grow peacefully amidst the tall, thin blades, their 
petals drawn to the sky.  Towards the far south, occasional, odd shimmers of 
light on water hint to the presence of the lake.  Into the distant north, 
the impenetrable, sinister shape of the Forbidden Forest covers the horizon 
in shrouds of dark-brown and green.  The smooth, rounded form of the 
weather-beaten wall extends northeast towards a tall gate, underneath which 
an external dirt path transforms into the pathway to Hogwarts.  To the 
southwest, the wall steadily approaches the village of Hogsmeade, offering a 
good view of the only all-magical settlement in Britain.

      <desc>The village comes closer in sight, with occasional houses blooming along the 
dirt path that eventually reaches the gates of Hogwarts.  Grouped around the 
luminous High Street, paved paths head in all directions, in a maze of 
buildings and trees, turning into dirt paths as they leave the more 
populated areas.  Close by, to the southwest, stands a large, impressive 
building, dwarfing the residences around it.  Although it is difficult to 
make out in the distance, the shape of a sort of bird with outstretched 
wings appears to have been sculpted upon the rooftop.

      <desc>The Castle rises in the distance, as magnificent as a Phoenix rising into 
the sky.  Like wingtips, smaller turrets pierce the air, while a single, 
very high tower might be the bird's beak.  Numerous windows of different 
sizes and shapes interrupt the grey walls, while green and silver-coloured 
ivy slithers upwards against the vertical surface, prodding it with 
insistent, little fingers.  A stone pathway runs between the front doors of 
the Castle and a heavy, iron gate that stands between the school grounds and 
Hogsmeade village.

      <desc>Magnificent stands, made of beige sandstone, surround the Quidditch Stadium 
in a rectangular shape.  Two, sideways entrances are placed towards the 
northern and southern ends of the western wall of the pitch.  Visible above 
the top of the arena are six hoops, placed on tall, golden poles in 
symmetric groups of three each.  Whether there is grass or hard ground 
underneath them is impossible to see from this angle, as the Hogwarts wall 
is not a great deal higher than the stands.  Except on Quidditch days, the 
stands are generally empty, although one team or another might be using 
their Sunday mornings to practice.

    <editdraft>The Hogwarts Wall shelters this area from the north and west, and two tall 
statues dominate the south and the northeast.  Surrounded in all directions 
by other thickets, several proud trees sprout here, with their thick trunks 
and strong, widespread branches.  The bark of these tall guardians is smooth 
and grey, the curvy texture perfectly following the shape of the trunk and 
its extremities.  These proud trees are beeches, often seen in vast Muggle 
parks as an ornamental feature that dominates the view; here, however they 
are in tone with the granite of the Hogwarts Wall.  As no beech could be 
perfect without an old, wooden bench, such a specimen is indeed perched at 
the foot of a particularly merry tree.  In addition to this idyllic setting, 
a few all-seasonal, blood red flowers grow scattered around the legs of the 
bench, and some irises grow alongside the beeches, caressing their bodies 
with their soft, violet petals.  The only thing missing from this landscape 
is a Renaissance lady sitting on the bench and reading.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Lovely Kristina, you have a great room desc here. I love the subtle humour in your phrases, your great, majestic atmosphere, and the little details of the flowers, which are excellent. You are a very awesome writer! Only thing here: watch the length. We usually do not allow for more than 14 lines in the desc, so I've rearranged your text to fit that. I also took out some of your word repetitions. However, please feel free to give me a shout if you think I've been too harsh or did something wrong. `-Cristina
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
1) Please replace echo number 0 by: &quot;A single bee buzzes through the air.&quot; The reason to cut the rest, which is lovely and poetic, is that it sort of enforces two particular seasons. Unfortunately, this place also has to be here in winter, and if it's as cold as it is in Scotland, a bee in winter will be reminding people of scattered, stricken animals freezing in the cold, not spring :D.
  
2) I am confused by your echo number 1. Usually, it is not the wind that shudders, but the tree. I would suggest rephrasing this echo to: &quot;The wind crashes against a tree top, making it shudder and groan.&quot; If you did not mean this though, please tell me what you meant, cuz I am slightly confuzzled.
  
EDS:
  
I have edited your ed. Not much, merely taking out repeating words and adding some commas. One thing: grey is the British spelling of the word. Gray is American. Of the two, we favour grey, since this is JK Rowling's world, and British :D. Well, well done here, I can see the delicate art student in you! `-Cristina
</editeds>
    <editfirst>The Hogwarts Wall shelters this area from the north and west, and two tall 
statues dominate the south and the northeast.  Proud trees, with thick 
trunks and strong, widespread branches, sprout in an everlasting barrier on 
this patch and are echoed in all other directions by other, younger 
thickets.  The bark of the tall guardians here is smooth and grey, the curvy 
texture perfectly following the shape of the trunk and its extremities.  
These proud trees are beeches.  With their grey-hued skin setting them apart 
in vast parks, they are used by Muggles as ornamental features that dominate 
the view and yet appear humble and vulnerable; here, however, they are in 
tone with the granite of the Hogwarts Wall, bathed in occasional explosions 
of violet, soft irises.  As no beech could be perfect without an old, wooden 
bench, such a specimen is indeed perched at the foot of a particularly merry 
tree, surrounded by seasonal, crimson blooms.  The only thing missing from 
this landscape is a Renaissance lady sitting on the bench and reading.  
</editfirst>
    <editfirstcomments>I left out the humble and vulnerable part... although it sounds poetic and nice, I decided that its unimportant. However, I left some of my sentences that you changed, such as the one with irises and the red flowers, because I really, really like it :) 
 
Im a bit doubtful about the all-seasonal word... Im not sure if its the right expression. I wanted a simple word to indicate that the flowers are all seasonal; unlike evergreen which would indicate that the plant (most times excluding the flowers) is all seasonal. Please, correct me on that if Im wrong :) 
 
I havent yet changed the echo with the wind I wrote it that way before because I like anthropomorphizing things. If its still not ok that way, Ill change it. As for the ed of the bench, I just changed a few words :)
 
(MS Word did something to my apostrophes)

      <desc>This old bench is made of the finest oak, its spiny legs and arms carved 
masterfully in simple, wavy shapes.  The back of the seat is slightly 
rounded at the top, delicately bending towards the arms; its fluid structure 
makes the bench appear as if it was made of a single piece of wood.  
Semi-transparent, grey paint that follows the smooth flow of the surface, is 
in places chipped by time--where the ashen colour is scraped off, it reveals 
a warm, honey-like hue of brown below.

    <editdraft>Here, in the shadow of the proud, northwestern Hogwarts Wall, atypically 
high grass is rising and swaying towards three old mulberry trees.  Gathered 
closely together, these tall and extremely thick trees create a welcoming 
atmosphere of an orchard.  The long, fruitful years of these mulberries have 
weighted down their overgrown branches, which now sweep the ground, twining 
with the high grass.  These old trees have the shape of fountains, a curtain 
of limbs sheltering the trunks.  This willow-like stance is the usual 
behaviour of the white mulberry, but a rather dark colour of the soil below 
testifies that the seasonal fruit of this species is black.  This area lies 
between a berry patch to the east and a tall-beech grove to the west.  Two 
statues dominate the north and southwest, and the south is taken by a peach 
tree; a magical orchard lies to the northeast, and the grounds continue to 
the southeast.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Like in my previous edit of your rooms, lovely Kristina, I hardly had to change things. Your writing is good and very fluent. One thing you might need to work on though is the length of your descs. I tried to adjust it here by tweaking some of your phrases, but if you think you want something changed, do let me know!
 
The more important points here are: 
 
1) You forgot one exit, to the southeast. No biggie; I added it. 
2) At one point, where you are talking about the white mulberry it's not really clear if you want these trees to be white mulberries or something else. I interpreted it one way, but if you'd like to make it different, by all means do and then note me about it.
 
Thank you for the hard work, Kristina! I love you writing. `-Cristina
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please change echo number 0 to: &quot;The trees sway in a gust of wind, a movement so enchanting it makes them seem alive.&quot;
 
2) Please change echo number 1 to &quot;A lively, yellow butterfly flutters between the trees, resting here and there atop the smallest twigs.&quot; The comma is necessary to separate the two adjectives.
 
I love that first echo, I can actually picture the image in my head, and it adds SO much to the atmosphere. Great work here, love! `-Cristina

    <editfirst>Here, in the shadow of the proud, northwestern Hogwarts Wall, the seasonal, 
exceptionally-lush is rising and swaying towards three old mulberry trees.  
Huddled together in a tight cluster, these tall, extremely thick trees give 
this patch the steady, thick-aired, welcoming atmosphere of an orchard.  
Branches explode off the old, overgrown, hunchbacked trunks; some of them 
sweep the ground, twining with the high grass.  This willow-like stance is 
due either to lack of care or to long, fruitful years, as the rather reddish 
colour of the soil below testifies that the seasonal fruit of this species 
is red, and not white as in the weeping, or white, mulberry.  At venerable 
ages, the trees have the shape of fountains, a curtain of limbs sheltering 
the trunks.  This patch lies between a berry patch to the east and a 
tall-beech grove to the west.  Two statues dominate the north and southwest, 
and the south is taken by a peach tree; a magical orchard lies to the 
northeast, and the grounds continue to the southeast.  
</editfirst>
    <editfirstcomments>Alright, I've accepted most of the edits, but I rearranged some of the 
sentences and changed some words, I hope that's okay.  I believe the desc is 
now one or two lines shorter, as I also shortened everything a bit :) I also 
changed the fruit to be black, because I wanted black mulberries, and thank 
you for reminding me of that :) I also changed the echoes as you said, 
nothing new there :D

    <desc>This berry patch sprouts out of an expansive field, between a northern 
orchard and open grounds in all other directions.  Exposed to the heavens, 
the plants receive both the heat of summer day and the torrent of autumn 
storms.  Five long rows of raised beds, bedecked with seasonal berries, 
stretch from east to west.  Each row contains a certain type of berry: 
strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and an assortment of 
magical berries.  Trellises run down the centres of all of the plots, 
providing more room for the fruit to grow.  In the warm seasons, the air is 
filled with the scents of sweet berries, fresh growth, and the musky aroma 
of rich earth.  Between the berry patches, dark-grey flagstones both serve 
as paths and to help suppress weeds.  Moss, however, thrives between the 
flagstones, softening the rocky edges and making the paths surprisingly 
comfortable to walk on, even bare-foot.  Several rustic benches stand along 
the paths, accompanied by small, green bins, often filled with waste for the 
compost.

    <editdraftcomments>Dear Brad, your description is very, very good, if a bit long. I think you have a good eye for detail and you don't like to rush your style, which is a trait I greatly appreciate in a writer. However, for the sake of our readers, we have to make descriptions usually somewhat smaller - 14 lines at the most. This can be done by trying to eliminate some of the more overworded sentences - for instance cutting down on some of the passive phrases like: &quot;&lt;object&gt; can be seen&quot;. I have done that on your description at the moment; please tell me if you disagree with something. Otherwise, great work, Brad, and keep it goin'!  `-Cristina
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please change echo number [1] to: 'A small flock of assorted songbirds swoop down on the bushes, searching for ripe berries. A moment later, they flutter off into the sky.'
 
EDS:
 
1) I love your ED; it adds a lot of detail! I have edited bits and pieces in it, however; please take a look when you get a spare moment.
 
2) You mentioned magical bushes. I think the readers would very much love to read about them in an ED. Please therefore add an ED about them; I personally can't wait. Additionally, please add this species to the thread: http://lumos.mugglenet.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6526 , to help the writing services team. 
 
Well, well done! `-Cristina

      <desc>Winding between the various beds of berry bushes, these smooth stones lie in 
organized chaos, the dark-grey slabs placed randomly, but with purpose.  
Though originally the rocks might have been rough, treading feet have 
smoothed down the surfaces over the many years.  Further softening the path 
is the moss that grows in the crevices between the stones even in the heart 
of winter, the deep green and the soft texture of the plants makes the path 
gentle both to the eyes and on bare feet.  Tiny, blue and white flowers 
sprout from the moss at various points, the pale colours lending to the 
relaxed nature of the path and the berry patch in general.  When touched, 
the stones feel pleasantly warm, even in the coldest parts of winter it is 
not quite clear if this is because of natural warmth or because of a charm 
placed on them at their formation.

      <desc>Masses of vines grow in the most westernmost bed here, tenaciously wrapping 
around the central trellises.  During the warmer parts of the year, these 
vines hang heavy with a multitude of berries, whose wondrous shapes and 
colours tend to be hidden by deep green foliage.  Four types of berries 
dominate this bed, though a few other types are scattered about.  Most 
notable are the persiberries, their bright purple fruit about the size of 
peach pits; several of these are glowing with various intensities at any 
given moment.  Procellanberries also reside here, the blueberry-sized drupes 
a deep blue, speckled with gold and hidden by slender, spiralling leaves.  
Somewhat obscured are the few crystallynberry vines, the varied colours of 
their fruit somewhat pale and translucent, causing the berries to look much 
like gemstones.  At the southern end of the bed, wintermintberries sprout 
exclusively, as all other vines have been crowded out.  Tiny, delicate 
leaves grow along the vines, a deep pine in the centre fading to the palest 
green along the edges.  The conically spiralled wintermint berries grow only 
during the winter months, though their white, red-and-green-speckled 
surfaces make them hard to spot in the snow.  [to be made into obj]

    <desc>This patch is well-surrounded, as great and distant constructions loom over 
it: an outer wall to the extreme west, the Quidditch Pitch to the far south, 
and the Hogwarts Castle a way to the east.  Close-by, to the north and 
northeast, numerous statues stand in line one after the other.  Although 
from the western part of this area everything eastern is mostly hidden by a 
small, albeit very abrupt, almost-vertical cliff, this area stays true to 
its statuesque design; two human sculptures inhabit this area.  The first 
one depicts a marble man next to the rock face, looking at his reflection 
into a small pond; right above this figure, on top of the cliff, an 
emaciated, glass woman reaches out a dainty, fragile hand to the apparently 
self-absorbed male.  This spot also keeps in with the more vegetal pattern 
of its western neighbours: narcissuses bend their heavy, blooming heads all 
year-long, while asphodels sprout strait and tall.

      <desc>The statue represents a man of absolutely stunning beauty.  A hand reaches 
out to almost skim the surface of the small pond that he is kneeling by; his 
angelic, yet definitely-male, squared face and thick, wavy mane of hair are 
reflected in the eerily-still waters.  His stone body is chiselled into 
long, well-defined muscles that bespeak both strength and grace.  A simple 
loincloth covers his decency and on its belt is scribbled, &quot;Narcissus&quot;.

Her gaunt face is not helping the impression, dominated as it is by unsettlingly-big eyes and a silently-shouting mouth.  As she desperately holds out her hand over the top of the cliff, she mirrors the male statue's position, but fails to attract his attention, even as she wastes away for him..w

The alabaster variety is also called jonquils, to better separate it from the rest of the yellow daffodils.  Be they golden or ivory, the flowers are spelled to bloom all year long and contrast brilliantly against the stark-green grass.  Among them shoot the tall stems of asphodels, also charmed to constantly display their white corollas..w

    <desc>This aqua pasture is stormy and swollen with small hillocks, rising upright 
from the westward-sloped ground.  Between these earthy waves, slither eight, 
deep-purple, navy-blue and green-teal paths.  In the centre of the patch, 
from the top of the highest knoll, a lively spring chimes heartily as it 
cascades down and rebounds on moss-covered rocks.  The statue of a man on 
his chariot drawn by water-horses rides the spring's mouth, half-submerged 
in grass and snowdrops; several dolphins escort the conductor.  To the west 
stands the high, dark silhouette of Hogwarts Castle and to the south the 
wooden fence surrounding the Quidditch Pitch.  To the far-east the outer 
wall is faintly visible.

      <desc>The little paths are deeply curved in by generations of feet treading them.  
The middle, lowest part of the curve is a deep-purple that shades out to 
navy-blue then dark-teal.  The pebbles lining the lanes are a lighter, 
greener hue of teal than the lanes themselves; on the other hand, those 
pebbles are exactly the same shade as the grass creeping up the knolls and 
as the moss lining the rocky face down which the spring cascades.  As the 
sky grows dark each day, said moss is revealed to be luminescent, giving off 
an eerie, light-green light.

      <desc>The four water-horses drawing the chariot are true hippocampi: their front 
part, head, torso and legs are that of a common horse, except the 
close-cropped hair is a silvery green.  Their hind part is a fish tail, the 
scales coloured as well a silvery green; however, they have a liquid, 
metallic shine to them, whereas the hair, though healthy-looking, have a 
more matte finish.  The chariot itself is dark-silver, the colour of the sea 
under a laden sky, but many shiny gems of all shades of green, blue, and 
violet livens up the whole thing.  Several dolphins, also of a dark-silver 
colour, reared their heads out of the grass as they escort the chariot's 
conductor, joyfully smiling and showing white, sharp teeth.

slight pink tinge, these have a very light teal hue.  Their three outer 
petals are a brighter, purer white than the common could ever hope for, 
while the inner three ones are not lined with yellow-green, but with gold, 
as are their stems and leaves.  Like the moss that grows nearby them, at 
night they give off a gentle, if slightly spooky, green light.  Their 
properties include a mild anti-poison agent and a substance helping to 
reduce overweight.

forelocks, a sign is visible: it represents a trident with a small cross 
near the three-pronged head of the 3-foot long handle.  The man is holding 
in his right hand a similar trident, the points sharp and gleaming in the 
light; in his left hand are the silver-spun reins.  He is wearing an 
ankle-long toga and sandals.

      <desc>Only the plants growing directly near or in contact with the water's spring 
(namely the snowdrops and the moss) are luminescent at night; whereas the 
grass, though of a peculiar colour, acts as common grass regarding smell, 
size, taste, or light.  Because of this, the water is believed to be the one 
responsible for the luminescence, and may be of use in brewing potions or 
making objects that give off light or increase the night-vision.  The 
cascade is also wrapped in a mist of minute water droplets, making the light 
from the plants look vaporous and even stranger.

sinking in a mellow mattress of moss.  Furthermore, a cerulean canopy 
agreeably shades him.  The golden-green, tender moss blankets the ground so 
thickly that the soil isn't visible at all.  However, blue and white 
forget-me-nots creep against the green coverlet and define eight paths.  To 
the east looms the tall, dark silhouette of the castle; to the south stands

    <desc>Struggling against gravity, old age, and the ground sloping westward from 
the nearby castle, a wizened, lead statue of a man is leaning heavily on a 
tall scythe.  Barely visible on his forehead is a sign, like a small 'H' 
with a crossbar on it.  Shadowed by his shaggy mane, bushy eyebrows, and 
tired, heavy eyelids, his cataract-afflicted eyes gaze to the southern 
Quidditch Pitch.  His thin, downward-curved lips and hollow cheeks almost 
completely disappear underneath his rough, bristle beard.  A dull-grey robe 
poorly covers his spindly silhouette.  Resting on his hollow, stertorous 
chest, a huge hourglass dangles on a thin, lead chain and makes the derelict 
man hunch even more.  From his bare feet, eight, narrow paths start off 
through bushes and dried, spiky herbs.

created by magic, a miniscule pin prick of light shoots forth from above, 
leading to the prominent statue to the west.  Lacking light and water, a

    <editdraftcomments>This is a lovely description, Surabhi, and I just made a few tweaks here and there. I added (storm/thrust) in sentence three because I felt rise is a bit tame for stone hedges, but if you'd like to use any other word to that effect, I'm ok with it. Thank you for you hard work! `-Cristina

    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please change echo number [0] to: 'The huge footprints inexplicably fade away, only to mysteriously return the next second.'
 
EDS:
 
Please remove ALL the commas between the keywords to your ed. in order to do so, you need to use ed rekey -- please note me if you are unsure of what they syntax is :) 
 
I've edited both your eds. Please also add 'vegetable' to the keywords of 'patch'. I loved the mysterious footprints in this room -- that's an awesome touch! `-Cristina

      <desc>The markings suggest the presence of a large, four-legged creature, with seven large toes and an eighth small one. The huge feet have left deep imprints on the ground; the earth shows evidence of once having been soft and mushy, but it has grown hard with the absence of any water. In this context, the prints have a fossil-like, permanent quality, embedded in the soil.

detailed view of the monstrous Quidditch Pitch wall towering in the east.  
Faint graffiti can be seen all over this impressive barrier.  The path in 
its entirety is paved with plum-sized cobbles of various shapes.  Alongside 
the lane's full length, jagged rocks sprout out in wet earth.  A strong 
stench of rotten vegetation hovers around here, perhaps originating in the 
single row of low, flowerless begonia shrubs that runs along the wall of the 
sports' arena.  Far over and across the northern horizon, a plume of purple 
smoke trails its way into the endless sky, emerging from a lonely chimney.  
A determined walker might even reach the source of the puffy fumes; though 
the eastern, north-eastern, and south-eastern view is blocked by the huge 
wall, but firm trails stretch in all other directions.

I personally love it. I've edited your room here and there, making the sentences longer and more expressive here and there, but please feel free to rephrase if you think I've done anything wrong. Just remember to send me a note when you are done with the changes, telling me what you have changed. Well done, wonderful girl! `-Cristina

keys) shape her dangling earrings and the pendant on a necklace of clear, 
teal beads.  A plain tunic covers her to the knees, and a belt of blue-green 
pearls girdles it.  On the three-inch pedestal bearing the statue is simply 
inscribed: &quot;Melia&quot;.

    <desc>Trees of many vibrant, lively colours are spread out plentifully here, 
throughout the year.  There are plums in wide rangers of purple, to an 
almost ink-like blue, peaches from a peppy pink to a dark orange, and apples 
in a wide range of hues, from spring-green to yellow and maroon.  The leaves 
on these trees are dark and full of life; magic keeps them green and with 
fruit throughout all seasons.  This uncanny orchard wavers with the 
slightest breeze, but the trees are strong, despite their fragile 
appearance.  Even the grass here is full of life, thrumming with as much 
energy as a blade of grass can possess.  Everything is coloured vibrantly, 
in rich, full tones.  Even the sky appears more expressive in all its moods 
above this patch.  The patch continues in all directions, overshadowed by 
the Quidditch Pitch to the east and the Hogwarts Outer Wall to the south and 
southwest.

The leaves on the trees are dark, and full of life. They waver with the slightest breeze from the wind, but they are still very strong, despite their fragile appearance. Even the grass here is full of life and filled with as much energy as a blade of grass can possess. Everything is either a lush-green, or a vibrant, happy colour. Even the sky on sunny days is a bright, cheerful, light-blue. To the southeast the lake is a crystal-clear blue, and to the southwest the tall Quidditch Pitch can be seen.

    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
Just a suggestion: Echo number 1 would sound better, I think, as: &quot;The various, rich fruit in the trees exude a lingering, sweet scent.&quot; But it's your call, love! `-Cristina

    <editfirstcomments>Lovely Shannon, what can I say? This room is absolutely beautiful! I missed your writing; it's so full of life! Only a few things edited out, mostly to give your writing even more diversity. You missed out on mentioning the exits, so I added that towards the end, and I think you mistook the Quiddtich Pitch for the lake (I know, I know, they're both blue, but what can we do? *gasps* I'm a poet, wow!). Awesome work; it's great to have you back! `-Cristina

    <desc>The edges of the old wall are chipped in places and rounded by fierce winds 
in others, but its surface overall is level.  Dull-grey in colour, it 
appears every bit as impenetrable as the large castle looming eastward.  
From its thirty-foot height, the structure towers above the grass and small 
bushes at its base, gazing from an elevated angle onto the gigantic stands 
that surround the Quidditch Pitch.  The air is filled with discrete, sweet 
scents of the western willows and linden trees bordering Hogsmeade village.  
Tapping the walls with insistent branches are a few low, thorny hedges, with 
dark-green, waxed leaves.  Into the southeastern distance, strange shimmers 
of light reflected off a wavy surface hints to the presence of a lake.  The 
wall curves inward to the northeast, approaching a large, iron gate; to the 
southwest, it runs parallel to a Hogsmeade artery.

      <desc>A small shed lies in the shadow of seats that are placed high in the air, 
all around the rectangular field.  The wall is not much taller than the 
stands, therefore the limited view only allows one to see the six hoops, 
three on each side of the field.  At their base, a glint of gold suggests 
the presence of poles holding the hoops in the air.

      <desc>To the west, the dirt path of Hogsmeade branches into two roads: one leads 
south, towards the core of the village and the high street; the other heads 
further to the west, towards a lane bordered with trees, especially willows. 
 Quiet throughout most of the day, the village seems to explode into a 
buzzing existence at odd intervals.  As if carrying the gossips to the 
castle, tiny birds fly by, chirping excitedly.

    <desc>Rising high alongside the Hogwarts Wall, which stands to the north and west, 
a group of beautiful, tall maples brightens the surroundings.  A few 
carefully-cultivated, red maples occasionally stand out from their simpler 
kin, as their seasonal leaves are red.  All the trees reach high towards the 
sky with their slender bodies and thin, long arms; during the warm seasons, 
their tops form a magnificent complementary contrast between warm red and 
lush green.  Their bark is thin, its many grey layers falling off in places 
and revealing an inner, yellowish core.  Fallen peels and chunks of bark 
cover the ground around the maples, calmly lying on the bed of soft, green 
moss that covers the soil.  Effortlessly graceful and tall, these trees are 
worthy of envy as they oversee the ground from close to the heavens.  Their 
shadow occasionally falls on an eastern statue, a southeastern apple tree, 
and on far-streaming grounds to the south and southeast.  An equally tall 
and challenging group of beech trees stands to the northeast.

a group of beautiful tall maples cherishes the surroundings.  A few

and elegant trees observe the statue of a High Priest to the east, an apple 
tree to the southeast, and the rest of the grounds that extends to the 
south, and southwest, while an equally challenging group of beech trees lies 
to the northeast.

    <editeds>Wonderful echoes you have here, as usual, dearest Kristina. One edit though:
 
1) Please change echo number 1 to: 'The wind howls through the tree tops, pushing the maples towards the Hogwarts Wall. A soft, scratching sound cuts through the air when the branches are brutally twisted against the granite barrier.

    <editfirstcomments>You have some lovely imagery here, between the maples and the surroundings. I like the detail of the bark peelings; they add a lot of flavour to your room. I put in some edits here and there, mostly taking out repetitive words and rephrasing where I thought that was in order. If you, however, want something different with the room, please rephrase again and let me know; then I can come edit again. Good work, please never stop writing! :D `-Cristina

this patch of soft, tender grass from the north and west; the groves lining 
the battlements add to the shade.  The wall goes on southward, bends to the 
southwest, and turns the southwestern corner of the Quidditch Pitch; the 
latter's northwestern corner and entrance stands roughly southeast of this 
area.  The silhouette of the Castle is imprinted against the eastern sky.  
To the northeast, a faint glimpse of a driveway, running from the Hogwarts 
outer gates to the castle doors, flickers in and out of sight, depending on 
the weather and lighting.  Seven paths allow exits out of this patch in any 
direction, except the southeast, where a broom shed blocks the way.  In the

    <editeds>ECHOES:

2. Please change echo number 2 to: 'The tender grass shivers, hunching against a draft of wind.'
 
EDS:
 
I've taken a look at the ed, it's perfect except for a few tiny tweaks that, I think, would improve the fluidity of the text. As ever, your statues are breathtaking, and I really love them. `-Cristina

      <desc>The wrinkles on the sculpted man's white-bearded face centre around his 
slightly white-veiled eyes; it seems age or heavy reading has rendered him 
half-blind.  Nonetheless, behind the ominous cataract, the liveliness in his 
eyes show that only his sight has dulled, not his sharp mind.  A 
grandfatherly smile curves his lips and brightens his ancient, venerable 
face.  Though hunching with the weight of many, many years and much 
knowledge, the man's stone body is still surprisingly fit.  Thus, it is a 
very firm, left hand that holds upright a seven-branched staff; the staff's 
handle is carved to outline a rectangle and the letter &quot;V&quot; inside of it.  
The fingers on the right hand are bent in a blessing gesture, that of a 
&quot;main de justice&quot;.

    <desc>When in season, the wide branches of a tall and healthy peach tree cast a 
cool shade along the verdant grass.  The towering, tapered peak of this 
charmed monument to nature is wreathed with new green leaves that sway 
gently in soft winds.  Supple, smooth fruits hang from the branches, looking 
fit to burst with their sweet juices; their mottled skins change from light 
orange to deep red in an infinite gradient.  Hard pits are scattered in the 
tree's shadow; some are old and dry, while others are still wet and pulpy.  
Tall beech trees form a small, northwestern grove, and a clump of berry 
bushes are to the northeast.  Whenever light strikes this patch, a distant, 
stone figure of a venerable, old man casts a long shadow from the west.  To 
the southeast is a low, black table, while the remainder of the Hogwarts 
Grounds branch out in all other directions.

    <editdraftcomments>Wow.  This room makes me want to eat a peach, even though I hate peaches, 
hehe.  In your 2nd sentence with the sun, I think I remember cris saying 
that it shouldn't be mentioned because what if it's nighttime, or there's a 
storm?  So I took it out, and rearranged the rest of the sentence.  I 
believe those were the only big changes I made.  :)

    <editeds>I do love the echo just as it is, lovely Petra. Mira my sweet, although the fruit itself would not be mushy, peaches are soft when they are ripe, so they would make a mushy splatting noise when they drop. `-Cristina

    <editfirst>The wide branches of a tall and healthy peach tree cast (a) cool shade along 
the verdant grass.  Its (towering), tapered peak is wreathed (with) new 
green leaves (that sway) gently in the soft wind.  Soft, smooth fruits hang 
from the branches, looking fit to burst with their sweet juices, their 
mottled skins (change) from light orange to deep red in an infinite 
gradient.  Hard pits are scattered in the tree's shadow; some (are) old and 
dry, (while others are) still wet and pulpy.  Tall beech trees form a small 
grove in the northwest, and a clump of berry bushes are to the northeast.  
The stone figure of a venerable old man casts a shadow over the grass to the 
west.  A low, black table hangs over the southeastern grounds, and the fresh 
grass of the Hogwarts (grounds) branch out in all other directions.  
</editfirst>
    <editfirstcomments>I've altered this first edit as well.  Pet, this desc is simply delectable 
and its savory texture I don't want touched.  However, as Mira pointed out, 
there is the issue of sunlight since these grounds will also be in moonlight 
and storms.  This brings me to the next point.  I don't want this desc 
altered because it is amazing.  However, in the winter, especially in 
Scotland, there will be no grass, but sleet and snow.  Now, fresh fruit and 
leaves become a problem for a regular ol' peach tree.  You need to remember 
that these descs are covering more than just one season.  How to get around 
this?  Cheat.  Sentence 1 I put in a phrase that covers said problem.  The 
2nd sentence I changed a lot.  I put 'charmed' to show that it's touched 
with magic, hence able to flower year round, and put 'monument to nature' to 
not repeat the word 'tree'.  If you prefer a different way of stating that 
or put 'monument of nature' it's all good.  Cris will catch anything that 
doesn't seem appropriate.  I also changed 'in the soft wind' to 'in soft 
winds' as there will be certain weather conditions that will not have a 
simple 'soft wind'.  The generic way I put it allows the element of soft 
winds without committing to it.  I changed 'soft' supple in the following 
sentence as you have the same word (soft) just 2 words before.  In the 5th 
sentence the comma is unnecessary.  In sentence 6 I deleted the grass part 
since it's not needed and this variation won't cause confusion.  Granted, I 
stated at the beginning 'when in season', but to me it seems to refer to the 
tree so I simply took out the chance of confusion while maintaining the 
integrity of the sentiment.  I changed the last sentence for the same 
reason, to avoid 'grass', but still get the point across.  (As a side note, 
you don't need a comma between 'southeastern grounds and the fresh grass'.  
The most common mistake I see in writing is comma happy folks.  It's my 
mission to clean the world of unruly commas.  =D ) `-tina

</editsecond>
    <editsecondcomments>I have adjusted and tweaked this desc a bit, especially in its second part, since I thought a few things were a little unclear. 1 thing in particular bothered me, and that was the fact that you can't have shadows unless you have light. So during cloudy weather and/or during the night, we can't have the old man to the west casting any shadows. I did adore the fluency and poetic nature of this desc, and I think you're pretty and you samba! `-Cristina

    <desc>The wall runs parallel to the large, eastward stands that surrounds the 
Quidditch Pitch; to the west, in the inaccessible distance, streams a 
Hogsmeade dirt path.  Chipped and eroded at the edges, the barrier is strong 
and immutable: a relic of power and beauty, resembling Hogwarts Castle in 
structure and magnificence.  Away to the north is a large, iron gate, draped 
on the background of a sinister forest, darkening the horizon.  To the 
south, the wall slithers against increasingly-frequent hedges and trees, 
while vines of ivy embrace it tentatively at first, then passionately.  
Beyond the Quidditch Pitch far to the southeast, the stone sinks into the 
blue depths of a lake.  A sweet scent of linden leaves and willow branches 
hangs discreetly in the air, mingling with the freshness of the surrounding 
grass and shrubberies.

    <editdraftcomments>Dearest Surabhi, I've edited this area a little bit. Though the main elements are wonderful here, I've reworded certain things. Please have a look at what I've edited and let me know if you disagree with anything. One important thing: I've taken away the last sentence of the desc as you wrote it, because writing it there means that the bullfrogs are permanently there. Poor things, they need their sleep, too!! So I would suggest you add the bullfrogs in an echo. `-Cristina
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please change echo number [0] to: 'The magical clouds clear overhead for a moment, and an extraordinary brightness briefly passes through the grove.'
 
2) Please change 'into' to 'to' in echo number [1] and add an 'and' before 'displaying'. 
 
3) Please change the last sentence of the desc into an echo, and please change echo number [2] into an ed.

bright, yellow butterflies happily dart around and chase each other just

    <editdraftcomments>Dear Kristina, not many comments from me, as usual. I've only altered a few words here and there to take away some repetitions or break a bit the longer sentences. Other than that, it's a perfect room, and I love it! You always have great atmosphere in your rooms! `-Cristina

    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) In your echo number [0], I have a suggestion to make. Usually, sweet smells are not exhilarating, but languid, lazy, and heavy. I would rephrase this echo to: &quot;One of the mushrooms emits a puff of pink smoke, which spreads an intoxicating, sweet smell, mixed with an exhilarating dash of mind.&quot; However, if you wish to keep it this way, please add a comma before &quot;sweet&quot;.
 
2) Please add a comma in echo number [1] after &quot;single&quot; and remove the one before &quot;and&quot;.
 
3) Please change echo number [3] to: &quot;The cheerful singing of a bird echoes through the glade.&quot;

    <editdraft>An old and venerable apple tree's long-fingered limbs grasp the air over the 
lush grass.  Pink and white blossoms line its branches, framing perfectly 
shaped red apples.  Enchanted to bloom all year long, it graces the Hogwarts

it, casting faint light on its lithe frame.  A stately peach tree is 
standing to the northeast, to the side of the northwest maple grove.  Two 
statues cast their shadows over the northern and southeastern land, and the 
verdant Hogwarts grounds stretch out to the south, west, and southwest.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Lovely petra, let me first say that this is one great room!  I changed the 
first sentence and took out 'whole' as 'year' denotes the whole year.  I 
also changed the 'tree' to 'its' as tree is mentioned in the previous 
sentence so its flows naturally without being redundant!  In the 3rd 
sentence, I put in 'colossal' as most folks will sort of be tripped up by 
the word plant as a tree.  'plant' creates an image of like a fern or a 
pothos, which is small.  With colossal it still seems like a tree, hehe.  
The next sentence is hard to read, but hard to write as well.  I personally 
think the sentence should read: To the northeast stands a stately peach 
tree, its branches reaching northwest toward the nearby maple grove.  So 
that it makes more sense.  In the following sentence, I changed it to 
'while' and 'continue to stretch' so that the 2 sentences are linked.  If 
you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to bring 'em up!  :) thanks 
again for all of your hard work!  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Your echo seems just fine to me :) it's very colorful, I can actually hear 
that apple mushing itself on the ground!  `-mira

    <desc>A Hogsmeade side-path is barely discernible to the west, masked by a web of 
thick branches as it runs parallel to the wall.  Eastward, the Quidditch 
pitch is near enough to distinguish patterns on its beige, sandstone 
structure.  Between the wall and the arena stretches a small patch of grass, 
littered with bushes and weeds.  In the warmer seasons, small flowers peek 
from amidst the blades of the green carpet.  To the southeast lie the 
gigantic, blue depths of the Hogwarts Lake, while the entire northern 
horizon is covered by a dark-green shadow that represents the Forbidden 
Forest.  Brushing against insistent, prodding branches, the wall goes on to 
the northeast and to the south.

      <desc>The Quidditch Pitch is surrounded by a rectangular arena, made of 
light-coloured sandstone.  Other than the occasional streaks of grey, where 
old age and fierce winds have corroded the material, there are also some 
moving patterns etched on the smooth surface.  Although it is difficult to 
tell from the distance, the carvings appear to represent a mass of forms in 
a perpetual action, chaotic enough to resemble a Quidditch match.

    <editdraft>A very old oak tree bursts forth out of the ground here.  The roots of the 
mighty Oak cover the entire ground making an unstable, uneven platform.  The 
trunk of the collosal Oak, covered in carvings, is thriteen feet in diameter 
at its base.  Branches shoot out from the central trunk in all directions.  
Even the branches have huge limbs coming from them.  There is a large hole 
in the trunk of the tree fourteen feet up.  During the summer, the mammoth 
tree serves as a large natural gazebo.  During the winter, it makes a 
perfect place to build snow forts.  Directly to the south is a beautiful 
Rowan grove.  The north and west are blocked by the Hogwarts wall.  In the 
northeast is a ravashing Birch tree grove..  To the east and southeast, is a 
romantic spots for young lovers to visit.

permeate the air with their slightly soporific, soothing scent.  The bench,

Outer Wall to the northwest and the distant, eastern Quidditch Pitch, this

to be found.  The circle of bushes may be exited from all cardinal

    <editsecondcomments>Lovely Petra, I have suggested an extra sentence here because I think it would be great if you gave your readers a bit of an idea where they are. I actually got lost twice on the grounds when I first visited them. Please remember that players won't have areamap to know where the important points on the grounds are, so it's good to every now and again give them a hint of where the castle or the major points - like the Quidditch Pitch or the forest - are. Splendid job here otherwise, girl! `-Cristina

    <editdraft>This part of the grounds is covered in a tall patch of dry, dead shrubs.  
Weaving in and out of each other, they look somewhat like a giant, thorny 
tumbleweed.  A weak undergrowth of stunted violets and garlic mustard is 
trapped in the stiff vines nearer to the outside, but inside the clump all 
the grass has been suffocated.  There are exits in all directions to various 
other parts of the Grounds.

    <desc>Beautiful rowan trees and bushes litter the earth here.  The trees grow ten 
to twenty metres in height, decorated in the warmer months with pinnate 
leaves arranged in leaflets.  The late-spring flowers are dense; each 
five-petalled blossom is creamy-white and five to ten millimetres in 
diameter.  The seasonal fruit is round and brightly coloured, mostly orange 
and red, but a few specimens are pink, white, and yellow.  A sign is 
hammered into the ground in the centre of this lovely growth, surrounded 
during summer by speckled dots of colour in the shape of fallen berries.  To 
the west and south, a great wall surrounds the Hogwarts Grounds.  Amongst 
the groves, a secluded, romantic spot stands to the east, while trees and 
shrubs cradle the rowans to the north and northwest.  To the south is a very 
peculiar statue, and to the southeast, a muddy meadow.

    <editdraft>Beautiful Rowan trees and bushes litter the ground here.  The trees stretch 
between ten to twenty meters in height.  The leaves are arranged 
alternately, and are pinnate, with leaflets.  The flowers are dense; each 
flower is creamy white, and five to ten millimeters across with five petals. 
 The fruit is round and brightly colored, most are orange and red, but a 
very few are pink, white, and yellow.  A sign is hammered into the ground in 
the center of these beautiful and useful trees.  The ground is littered with 
fallen berries dotting the grass with bits of colour.  To the west and south 
is found the great wall surrounding the Hogwarts grounds.  To the east, a 
very pleasant romantic spot for lovers.  To the north and northwest are more 
trees and shrubs.  To the south is a very peculiar statue, and to the south 
east a muddy meadow.

    <editdraftcomments>Dear Russell, your description here contains lots of delicious elements, as usual. However, I would like to draw your attention of a few issues.
 
1) Firstly, your descriptions are very truncated. While I don't mind short sentences in general, this greatly detracts from the atmosphere you are trying to create. Rather than using words such as &quot;beautiful&quot;, I would like you to make the reader see WHY it is beautiful.
 
2) This is very important for the grounds, so please remember it: if you are talking about leaves, grass, ground, fruit, etc, remember to add &quot;in season&quot; or &quot;during the warmer part of the year&quot;, or &quot;during spring/summer&quot; etc, since this desc will stay on while there is winter here, too, meaning also when the ground is covered in snow. If you want it to be this way all year long, you need to add that there is some enchantment that keeps this area permanently warm.
 
3) Please remember to spell your words in the British way. You can easily avoid Americanisms by making your Word Processor spellcheck with British, rather than American, English.
 
I've edited this desc for you. Please do feel free to ask about anything you disagree with. Thank you for doing so much work for the project. `-Cristina
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) In your echo number [1], please write &quot;Flying Rowan&quot; as &quot;flying rowan&quot;.
 
2) For the sake of fluency, please change your echo number [2] to: &quot;A Bowtruckle runs in from the north, both of its arms loaded wtih fairy eggs.&quot;
 
3) Please change echo number [5] to: &quot;A single wood louse escapes the grasp of a Bowtruckle; it is immediately snatched and gulped down by another tree-guardian.&quot;
 
4) Please change echo number [6] to: &quot;A Bowtruckle jabs its fingers into the side of a rowan tree, looking for any insects.&quot;
 
5) Please add a comma between &quot;ground&quot; and &quot;heading&quot; in the last echo.
 
EDS:
 
As a rule, I don't like the ground to be labelled. You've had signs in every room I've edited thus far. While I don't mind it as long as it's not often, please keep it in mind that the Hogwarts Grounds would probably not be labelled everywhere. However, I do like the information you give the readers here. I've added just a little bit for the sake of flavour - remember that if you put a sign here, this has to be educational for Hogwarts students, thus stress the topic of rowans from a magical point of view, rather than from our Muggle point of view. Please also remember that you can just pass the information to Noon (Carole), who also likes the significance of trees, materials, and such, and can include it either in the Writing Services department or in her own research.

      <desc>The rowan tree has many names, a lot of which are based in mythology and 
legend.  Such names are, for example: the mountain ash, the rune tree, witch 
wood, witchbane, quickbane, and round wood.  Though relatively small, the 
rowan is strong, and its sturdy trunk can be used in staff carving, and it 
makes for very good, defensive wands.  Apart from this, the tree's bark, 
flowers, and fruit are powerful potion ingredients.

tree, offers its white blossoms, tinged with the slightest hint of pink, to 
the world.  This beautiful, ethereal canopy shelters a patch of tender, 
petal-dappled grass, eight pebbled, white paths, and an artistically-wrought 
swing.  The lanes lead away from the tree's roots, ultimately swirling 
apart, in all cardinal directions.  The area is surrounded by groves and by 
a granite, outer wall on four sides: north, south, west, and northwest.  The

northeastern corner, however, the castle is barely visible; a path 
leads away around the stadium's southwestern corner.

    <editdraftcomments>Ooh, how pretty!  I like this japanese tree.  It reminds me of mulan :) 
(*loves disney*) anyway, just a comma here and there, and some tweakage of 
words.  Great work as always carole, your imagination and creativity never 
cease to impress me.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1. As a suggestion, I think you should change the timing of the first echo to daylight hours, since at night, you wouldn't be able to see the colour (thus the blossoms would lose some of the snowy quality). 
 
2. Please change echo number 1 to: 'A bluster of wind tears away some pebbles, making them cascade with a crystalline sound.' Here, I replaced the mild 'disturbs' with something a bit more dynamic, since you'd need quite a bit of force to make pebbles cascade.
 
3. Please change echo number 4 to: 'The blossom-laden branches of the cherry tree rock in the air.'
 
EDS:
 
I've edited all your eds. You had some grammatical problems here, so I am going to list a few points:
 
1) If clauses: these have the type: If + P, W. So: 
    
     type 1: If + present, Future/Infinitive/Modal+infinitive.
 
             (If I study, I will pass my exams.)
 
     type 2: If + simple past, WOULD/COULD + Infinitive
 
             (If the enchantment allowed it, the tree would still never flower)
 
     type 3: If + past perfect, WOULD/COULD have + Past participle:
 
             (If I had left him the key, he wouldn't have had to wait.)
 
2. Some word confusions: apparition should be appearance. Apparition refers for instance to ghosts, or dream-like figures, or suchlike. Points should be vertices in triangles. 
 
3. Singular/plural confusions. Probably the one which is hardest to get right was 'in the most baroque of patterns'. Here patterns should be plural, since you are referring to one pattern out of a bunch of patterns. 
 
Okay, huge explanation, I know, but it's just a small reminder. I know you probably know the theory of these things, but I just wanted to point them out once again. Your room is otherwise very good, with very good imagery - I particularly liked the Japanese tree. `-Cristina

    <editsecondcomments>I've tweaked your desc here and there, but nothing too big. I've also changed your 'western vista' to 'eastern vista', since the QP stands east, not west. Other than that, my main change was of the last sentences, which were slightly confusing, so I tried to clear them a little bit. Please feel free to rephrase, but, as ever, gimme a shout if you do. A great effort here! `-Cristina

      <desc>The flowers of this cherry tree have the stamens and pistils replaced by 
additional petals, thus forming so-called &quot;double&quot; flowers.  Though this 
structure immensely enhances their decorative value, it also makes them 
sterile.  Thus, even if the perpetual-flowering enchantment on the tree 
allowed the blossoms to wilt away, they would still never bear any fruit.  
The two rows of petals are mostly pearlescent-white, with a tinge of pink 
towards the stems.  Because of the spell placed on the tree, and because the 
flowering precedes the appearance of leaves in this particular species, no 
touch of green foliage is visible at all.  Against the overall-white 
colouring, the dark trunk and branches appear almost black.

      <desc>The swing is wrought out of black iron, emblazoned with arabesques 
representing cherry branches and leaves.  White-enamelled flowers adorn the 
intricate pattern.  The swing is shaped like an arch-backed bench without 
feet; a plush, dark-pink, velvet cushion, just wide enough for two persons, 
is set against the seat, thus completing the ensemble.  Two slanted poles 
frame each side of the swing; they run from the ground and meet high in the 
air, forming a triangle with the soil.  A horizontal shaft connects the 
upward vertices of these two triangles and is attached to the swing, thus 
allowing it to rock back and forth.

pinkish-white flowers and fallen petals in the most baroque of patterns.

    <desc>A large, green field stretches in all directions, with small, daring blades 
of grass whispering and swaying at even the most gentle blow of the wind.  
The air is fresh and a few, small bushes tremble slightly with excitement 
and quiet exhilaration.  The level ground is soft and dark-coloured, its 
texture a mixture of frailty and strength.  Symmetrically placed to the east 
and west are the beige, sandstone edge of the Quidditch Pitch and the sturdy 
granite of the Hogwarts wall; their shadows alternately play on the green 
land, in a maddening dance of overwhelming joy.  A haze of green mist plays 
around the grass, nearly subtle enough to miss, changing shape irrespective 
of wind and weather and exuding a scent of sweet passion.

    <desc>A large circle of small, mossy stones enclose what may once have been a 
flowerbed.  A thick, seasonal carpet of myrtle covers the ground inside, 
spilling in places over the stone rim.  The simple, purple flowers have

    <editdraftcomments>Petra my dear, how fantabulous to have a room from you!  :) just a few 
tweaks, nothing major here.  I do love your writing, especially the 2nd 
sentence.

    <desc>A patch of willows grows here, languidly swaying in a perpetual, soft dance; 
the seasonally golden-green boughs of these trees fall like heavy drapes to 
the northeast, east, and south, as though sensing the dampness of a 
waterside.  A clearing stretches amidst these bowing, dancing, sweet-scented 
ballerinas; the ground beneath is invisible beyond a thin layer of 
everlasting mist.  However, the soil is soft to the touch; during the warmer 
part of the year, the caress of long blades of grass is spiced with the 
occasional poking of their tips.  Four, large, weeping willow guardians, 
standing towards each of the main cardinal directions, stir the sheen of 
central, white smoke with their long fingers; beyond these, the fog clears, 
to seasonally reveal lush, green grass littered with flowers, or, in winter, 
fresh snow.  To the north, west, southwest, and northwest, the long locks of 
the willows part to reveal endless grounds.  To the southwest, the ground 
plunges into the delightful water of a lake.

    <desc>The horizon is lost here in a mass of clear, shimmering, whispering water - 
the Hogwarts Lake.  A grass-covered mound suddenly crashes down two feet of 
waterside into an elusive ring of little, rocky islets that appear and 
disappear with the wind.  For those brave enough to attempt it, these islets 
lead east, south, and northeast, into the lake.  Most students have already 
found a perfect place to sit by the lake right by the edge, where countless 
couples have worn out a step-like chair amidst surrounding weeds and, in 
season, bright crimson flowers.  A few willows line the waterside.  
Protected in their midst and masked by makeshift oriental curtains of 
swaying, dancing, soft, golden locks, is an older tree, its trunk open and 
hollowed.  North and southwest, the waterside goes on, heavy with the 
perfume of grass and willows.  The grounds stretch west and northwest, under 
the calm, watchful eye of the castle to the far north.

 Sculpted by storms and by restless outbursts of raging hunger, the shore 
exhibits intricate, geometric patterns that look like a Chinese mosaic.  
Footing is precarious at the edge, where even the grass has ceased growing.

gentle, everlasting swaying of their golden locks, the younger willows 
caress the knobbly fingers and the tired joints of their father.  A sweet, 
heavy perfume lingers about them, stretching to the hollowed trunk of the 
older tree.  A single bit of parchment hovers, four feet above the ground, 
at the upper edge of the hollow, magically enchanted to never fade.  An 
elegant hand has written, in glittering, cerulean ink: 'Something that is 
too small for one might be just large enough for two.  ' Every now and 
again, the parchment emits a soft giggle.

and Slytherins, of which a small fragment is still legible: 'Silver and

    <desc>Plunging down a steep slope, the grounds fall from the high waterside to the 
south into a soft beach stretching northeast.  The water kisses the shore in 
cold ripples, its adoring touches caressing the sand even as far as the 
roots of a few willows.  Everywhere, bathing in the freshness of the 
mountain air, grow blades of shy, tender grass and even flowers during the 
warmer part of the year.  A few smooth stones permit entry into the lake to 
the east and southeast; further along, the bottom becomes sharper-edged.  A 
path mysteriously and discreetly slithers north and northwest, cradled on 
both sides by shading, protective willows; at the feet of the trees grow 
small, white mushrooms.  Small, shiny pebbles with a flat, even surface lie 
buried in the beach, brought by the waves; they lead the way deeply into the 
grounds, westward and to the southwest.

    <editdraftcomments>Hi carole!  :) I like your festooned beam, hehe.  That sounds fun.  Anyway, 
just the usual grammar corrections.  And like I've mentioned before, it 
really helps to type up your desc inside of a Word document.  You had 
transluscent, when it should be translucent.  Not a big thing, of course, 
but tiny errors like that are easily correctable when using Word.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1. Please change echo number 0 to: 'Little, jingling bells attached to the festooned beam tinkle in a draft of wind.'
 
2. Please change echo number 1 to: 'The blustery wind tousles the grass amiably.'
 
3. Please change echo number 3 to: 'A sweet, cherry scent swirls about lazily.'
 
EDS:
 
1. I've edited both your eds. they just needed a few commas a two or three tweaks of phrase, to give them more vividness. Please have a look when you get a spare moment.

    <editsecondcomments>This room was very close to perfect. The only more serious problem I see is that, although your descriptions are very, very beautiful and vivid, you sometimes forget to make sure that the readers can understand what all the 'it's and 'trees' are, which is why sometimes the reading is difficult. Other than that, just a few tweaks here and there. Thank you for all the hard work, love! `-Cristina

    <desc>Although the Hogwarts Lake is nowhere in sight, as confined as this patch of 
earth is between the eastern Quidditch Pitch and a western, outer wall, the 
soil here is waterlogged and muddy.  Every step on it is tricky and very 
slippery.  The grass growing from the mud, half concealed by it, only 
contributes to the treacherous quality of the ground.  In fact, large 
stepping stones are set into the soggy dirt to allow people to walk out in 
all cardinal directions.  Unfortunately, however, the stones themselves are 
wet and slippy.  A probable cause of this overall moisture is an eastern 
duck pond; the nearby groves hugging the outer wall surely also add to the 
dampness.

however, the stones themselves are wet and slippery.  The water has probably 
infiltrated here from a small duck pond, to the east; also, the very nearby

    <editfirst>Although the Hogwarts Lake is nowhere in sight, (and) confined as this patch 
of earth is between the eastern Quidditch Pitch and the western outer wall, 
the soil is soggy and muddy.  Every step is tricky, what with the slippery 
earth.  The grass lying into the mud, half conceal(ed) by it, only 
contribute to this treacherous ground.  In fact, large step(s)tones are set 
into the ground to allow people to get around and leave in any direction 
they want; however, the stones themselves are wet and slippery.  The water 
has probably infiltrated here from a small duck pond, to the east; also, the 
very nearby groves that partially veil the outer wall, must surely add to 
the general moistness.

 The grass growing from the mud, half concealed by it, only contributes to 
the treachery quality of the ground.  In fact, large stepping stones are set 
into the soggy dirt to allow people to get walk out in all cardinal 
directions.  Unfortunately, however, the stones themselves are wet and 
slippery.  A probable cause of this overall moisture is an eastern duck 
pond; the nearby groves hugging the outer wall surely also add to the 
dampness.

    <editsecondcomments>Lovely Carole, this room is beautiful, though a tad bit unclear. I've tried to clear this a little bit, but if you think I've missed out on your meaning, please feel free to change the sentences around; only send me a note, too, if you do so. `-Cristina

    <editsecondcomments>This desc was a bit unclear. You have great ideas, but when you write them down, they are sometimes scattered. It's better to group things that go together, because this way you don't draw the reader's attention from point A to point B, to point C, and then to B, then to A again. I've tried to group some stuff together here, so that reading is not as confusing. If you think I've been too harsh though, please feel free to sell me on it! Huggles, `-Cristina

      <desc>This rubber duck is canary-yellow, with a rotund, soft body, big, 
bright-blue eyes, and an orange, rounded beak.  The obviously-enchanted 
object is unmarred by decay or stains, and is occasionally able to flap its 
wings and quack.  All the real ducks swimming around it in the pond, 
however, make a point of steering clear of what they apparently sense to be 
a human contraption.

      <desc>The pond is nearly round and about seven feet wide.  The water is only 
knee-deep and slightly muddy, as permanent and temporary occupants of the 
pond stir the dirt bottom.  Small, grey fish swim through the water, 
providing a constant attraction to any ducks passing by.  Water lilies 
seasonally float at the surface, adding a nice, soft touch of pinkish white 
to the blue ripples.

    <desc>In season, a vivid patch of dazzling white slithers eastward towards the 
whispers of clear water.  Daffodils, daisies, and thousands of smaller 
plants freely spread through welcoming, lush-green blades of grass in mad, 
chaotic patterns.  Where the water of the lake timidly kisses the shore, the 
flowers give way to tall, dark weeds that could hide anything from duck 
nests to a first-year student.  A sweet perfume lingers in the air, 
accompanied by the heavier scent of a patch of willows.  The trees stand 
patiently alongside a small path that leads to the waterside, their elderly 
heads bent and their arms endlessly swaying languorously in a quiet, 
mystical dance.  The imposing silhouette of Hogwarts Castle rises northward 
like a great Phoenix with outstretched wings.  The lake, clear and gleaming 
like a polished diamond, stretches east and south, with the waterside 
following northeast and southwest.  To the west, the willow patch continues 
to cradle the path, while to the northwest are lovely, green grounds.

      <desc>The willows are tall and knobbly, with smooth barks and abundant, caressing 
arms.  Their sways seem in tune with some sort of mystical rhythm, because 
they move regardless of the wind, their fingers brushing against each other 
like ballerinas flying across a stage of perfumed air.  Weightless and 
endless, their rustling is soft and sweet, their branches gentle like a 
lover's adoring touches.

cleared a small strip of land.  Near the shore are seasonal, dazzling 
clusters of elegant, purple bellflowers, chaotically littered with 
daffodils, daisies, and thousands of smaller plants.  Where the shore 
caresses the water stand taller weeds.  Thick and very tall, these could

Hogwarts Lake spreads east and south.

    <editfirst>. When (in) season, a vivid line of glittering, white sand can be seen to the 
southeast where the water has cleared a small strip of (earth) from his 
gentle brushing of the land.  Near the shore can be seen dazzling clusters 
of bellflowers of an elegant purple colour.  Along with these (are) also 
daffodils, daisies, and thousands of smaller plants.  They all seem to be 
spreading in a beautiful, yet random pattern about the ground.  Where the 
shore seems to caress the (sand/water?)  Are taller weeds.  These weeds seem 
to be tall and thick enough to possible hide any array of things such as a 
small ducks nest, to even a smaller sized first-year student.  The nearby 
willows in this area seem to sway (elegantly) in the wind, almost as though 
the trees are actually dancing (to) a silent melody in the air.  The sight 
of Hogwarts Castle can be seen coming from the north, with stone bridges 
laying just slightly north of here.  A gathering place of some sort has been 
constructed to the west.  A large fountain lays to the northeast looking 
quite elegantly constructed.  Even more waterfront can be seen to the 
southwest, (while) a flowerbed to the north can be observed from afar from 
here.

    <editfirstcomments>Mike!  How great to see your first room.  I've done just a few tweaks here 
and there.  You have overall, great creative writing which is cool.  I took 
out a middle sentence and edited it to, &quot;A sweet scent wafts through the air 
that cant exactly be (pinpointed), along with a noticeable smell of the 
patches of willows.&quot;  I think this should rather be an echo, not part of 
your desc :) if you have any questions over your edits, please let me know!

    <editsecondcomments>Your descriptions have a good amount of detail and the elements you put inside are atmospheric and beautiful. However, I would like to make a few points:
 
1) Your desc is too long. The maximum length is 12 sentences or 14 lines, whichever happens first. Please try to rewrite sentences, grouping them, so that they take less space. The content you have is great, but it would sound even better more compressed.
 
2) You have a lot of passive constructions - 'can be seen' 'can be heard'. While not grammatically incorrect, these constructions slow down sentences, so try to avoid them. Instead of 'a river can be seen to the north' you could write 'a river trickles north' or 'a river stretches to the north'. 
 
3) You only mention the exits which are already written. It is very good that you mention exits, but please tell us about ALL exits, since players will not have a map to tell them where they might go. You tell them for instance that they can go southeast, but they will not be able to move there if they type southeast, so that will be confusing for them. Please mention ALL the exits at all times.

    <desc>A basin occupies most of the patch leaving room for only three stepstones 
leading away to the north, west, south, and east.  Four other stone paths 
wind to the northeast, northwest, southwest, and southeast.  The basin is 
made of smoothed, pink marble; its rounded edge is wide and high enough to 
serve as a bench.  The bottom is clearly visible through the shallow, 
impossibly still water.  In the center of the basin a statue is erected: no 
one can tell if it represents a man or a woman, or even a human, for the 
lean and tall silhouette is covered in a heavy, pink, marble cloak, its hood 
down.  From beneath the folds, extends a humanoid hand, holding a pink 
quartz ball.

    <desc>This patch is covered in sand, but not of an ordinary sort: its soft, fine 
grains are a light, luminous teal colour.  Golden pebbles adorn this stretch 
of sand; when examined from a distance, it is revealed than the pebbles form 
a letter &quot;H&quot;.  Average-sized, midnight blue boulders delimit paths to the 
south, southwest, west, northwest, north, northeast, and east.  In the 
latter direction, a soft splashing of water can be heard.  Small tufts of a 
teal grass, slightly darker in shade than the sand, swish in the wind.

    <name>* A Patch of Pink Grass</name>
    <copyright>Copyright © 2004-2010  Project Legilimensia</copyright>
    <desc>This patch is very secluded and seldom visited, as it is trapped between 
Hogwarts Castle, the western cliffs, a southeastern lake, and a southern 
waterside.  Only a tiny, southwestern lane struggles between the damp shore 
and a castle's corner; seven other paths leave the area in all other 
cardinal directions.  As a rule, boys make a point of circling this area as 
far as they can, possibly because the entire, sand-covered area is carpeted 
in baby-doll-pink grass, dappled with dainty daisies.  Though breathtaking, 
the intensity of the pink tinge is shocking at first.  Heedless of the 
joyful splash of colour, the dark-grey silhouette of the nearby castle looms 
from the southwest up to the northeast; its solemn presence utterly fails to 
dampen the peculiar, intense, thick atmosphere in this area.  
</desc>
    <editdraft>This patch is very secluded and seldom visited, trapped as it is between the 
Castle, the western cliffs, and southeastern Lake and southern waterside.  
Only a tiny way between the latter and a castle's corner leads out, although 
eight paths leaves the area to the landmarks mentioned.  However, there 
might be another reason why it is rarely treaded on, at least by guys: the 
entire sandy ground is covered in baby-doll-pink grass and dappled with 
dainty daisies.  The sight, for being cheerful, mostly comes as quite a 
shock upon entering this patch for the first time.  Heedless to that joyful 
splash of colour, the dark-grey silhouette of the Castle looms from the 
southwest up to the northeast, but still fails at dampeing the peculiar 
atmosphere hanging here.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>OMG DAISIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :) *breaths heavily* I'm ok.  - just the 
usual tweaks and adjustments here for you awesome carole, nothing major.  I 
do like this room a lot because of the creativity.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1. Please make sure that students are actually allowed outside at the hours of your echoes. For all certainty, since they also have to return back to the castle, I'd make the final hour something like 5 or 6 pm.
 
2. Please change echo number 0 to: 'A male student distractedly enters the patch. Looking utterly frightened, however, he immediately hurries off.'
 
3. Please change echo number 1 to: 'The blades of grass catch a fugitive ray of light and reflect it in a golden aura.'
 
4. As a suggestion, I think echo 2 is better like: 'The grass giggles softly as the wind ruffles and tickles it.'
 
ECHOES:
 
1. I've edited both your eds, so please have a look when you have a moment. `-Cristina

    <editsecondcomments>Awww, I adore this splash of pink, it's absolutely lovely! I've just tweaked things here and there, particularly the sentence about the 'guys', since it was slightly colloquial. As ever, my rephrase is a suggestion, so feel free to change it and gimme a shout about it. `-Cristina

      <desc>The ground and paths here are attuned to the pink grass.  The sand is 
composed of tiny, pale, pinkish-gold beads of quartz.  These are mostly 
hidden by the grass and flowers, remaining only really visible on the eight 
paths, which are all covered in sand.  Apart from the shift from grass to 
sand, the lanes are also delimited by rough, fist-sized, pink quartz.

      <desc>The grass is beautiful and evidently very well cared-for.  The blades are 
tall, large, and look exactly like any blade of grass, except for their hue; 
this grass is a bright, vivid, baby-doll pink, its edges and tips thinly 
lined with gold.  The everlasting daisies poke their heads up, following the 
same colour pattern.  The stems are the exact same pink as the grass, while 
the pinkish-white, golden-lined petals looks like a pale-skinned bride's 
blush.  Even the normally yellow centres have opted for a frank-gold sheen.

    <name>* A simple Patch of Grass</name>
    <copyright>Copyright © 2004-2010  Project Legilimensia</copyright>
    <desc>Although not directly bordered by any wall, this patch of grass is lined by 
the Hogwarts Castle from the southwest all around to the east.  It is almost 
like it's nestled against a stony lap with two equally-stony, protective 
arms outstretched around it.  Thus, six of the eight paths lead to the 
battlements, while only the southeastern and southern ones run to the Lake.  
Far down to the south, a narrow way squeezes away in-between the large body 
of water and the shielding hulk of the building.  The lanes themselves are 
simply grey, smooth pebbles laying into more or less strait trails.  Around 
them, grow a deep-green grass, perfectly normal-looking grass, or, inwinter 
white, plain, tinkling snow.  In fact, if it weren't for the secluded and 
secure atmosphere resting heavily on the patch, nothing would be really 
worth mentioning about this patch.

    <editdraftcomments>Carole, overall good room here, just a few tweaks.  Also, your last sentence 
concerns me, it seems a bit awkward and unnecessary.  I left it up because 
perhaps you could work on it before sending an edit for cris, or maybe she 
could look at it and get something to work because my brain can't process 
right now, lol.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1. Echo number 2: please write &quot;castle&quot; instead of &quot;Castle&quot;.
2. Echo number 3: I think this would sound better if you had &quot;roughtly ruffled&quot; rather than the other way around, but this is just a suggestion. 
 
Lovely, passionate echoes. #2 is absolutely beautiful. `-Cristina

Far down to the south, a narrow way squeezes away in-between the large body

nothing would really seem out of the ordinary at all.

    <editsecondcomments>Lovely Carole, this patch was great, and you built it up quite nicely to stress the contrast within the last sentence. I've just tweaked things here and there. Two main comments, I think:
 
1. Grammar: the second if clause (the one with if + past), does not use wasn't, even though that would be the normal thing to do, but weren't. So if it weren't, not if it wasn't.
 
2. Even grass is seasonal, because Scottish winters generally come with a lot of snow, so the snow would make it impossible to see the grass.
 
Otherwise, perfect, lovely Carole, you evil samba queen! `-Cristina

    <desc>The nearby eastern lake permeates to this patch of moist soil where little 
trickles of water join puddles in an intricate, liquid labyrinth.  Thick, 
cedar planks are thrown here and there, allowing for safe, dry passage 
around this patch and out of there: to the east, northeast, and north stands 
the looming silhouette of the castle; to the west and southwest, the 
humidity in the air betrays the close proximity of the lake.  To the south 
and southeast, gentle scents bespeak of the presence of the flower beds.  
Sinking their roots deep into the fertile soil, impossibly tall, cedar trees 
afford some shade.  In the centre of the patch, on a slightly raised patch 
of dry earth, a sarcophagus lies.  Her left hand resting on it, as if to 
keep it closed, a statue of an Egyptian woman is holding a copper scale in 
her right hand, and a falcon is perched on her shoulder.

      <desc>The sarcophagus is highly decorated with gold and lapis-lazuli and depicts a 
pharaoh on its lid: the richness of the design with the stripped, large wig 
and the crossed arms holding the cane and the whip is a sure sign.  A small 
crack runs along the lid, betraying where it meets the rest of the 
sarcophagus.

Egyptians and on top of it, a cone of perfume concrete is slowly melting.  
Her eyes, outlined in black kohl, are narrowing at her scales, as if 
something was off.  A large, flat, round necklace covers her chest down to 
her cleavage; semi-precious gems, feldspar, cornelian, and white quartz 
weave a pattern of stylised lotus flowers on a gold mounting.  On her left 
shoulder, covered by the necklace, stands a falcon; and from underneath it 
flows down a simple, sleeveless dress woven out of the finest linen.  The 
pleated material follows her curves down to her bare feet.  In her arms, a 
cat lazily reclines, eyes half-lidded.

empty, while the other contains a single feather, strangely standing upright

    <desc>To the west, the vista plunges over the cliffs and into the lake, which is 
extends southwards; to the north, Hogwarts is looming nearby.  This patch is 
covered in short, deep-green grass.  In the southeastern corner slumps a 
lone statue.  The socle represents a scallop shell and supports the languid, 
recumbent body of a very strange woman.  From the waist up, she is a very 
beautiful, if sorrowful, creature, her long hair covering modestly her 
womanly curves.  From the waist down, no legs are to be found, but a 
reptilian, scaled, glittering tail coiled tightly.  The woman is propped 
sideways on her elbow, while her other hand is half extended and oozes water 
that trickles down into the scallop shell.  From the statue radiate seven 
paths, to the south, southwest, west, northwest, north, northeast, and east.

    <desc>This patch of soft sand is closely bordered to the west and south by the 
Hogwarts Lake.  However, to the north, the coastline goes on up to the 
distant Hogwarts Castle, while to the south, the body of water ends up at 
the southwestern limit of the outer wall.  The latter continues towards the 
northwest, barring the western horizon of this area.  To the northwest, 
flower beds add a jolly, multicoloured touch to the vista; beyond this, the 
tall silhouette of the Quidditch Pitch is scantly visible.  The ground here 
consists solely of sand.  It is so gorged up with water that it is dark 
brown; moreover, it is heavily compacted.  Seven, large grooves furrow out 
of here, away from the centre of the patch and into every direction except 
the southeastern.  In the middle, a slightly-raised circle of sand is the 
pedestal to a sand castle; in the sculpture is embedded a gold bolt of

      <desc>The sand sculpture is a miniature replica of the Hogwarts Castle: every nook 
and cranny is carved to perfection: the angles are absolutely right, the 
curves are nicely regular, and the battlements are geometrically laid out.  
Even every single one of the windows are chipped in, every single one of 
them.  The only glitch in this patiently-honed sculpture is the &quot;North 
Tower&quot;: it is slightly crumbling and two small, half-buried lead figurines 
of wizards lay at its foot, among minute clods of sand.  The reason for this 
is that a metal blade has been thrusted into it.  This blade is 
lightning-shaped and wrought out of gold; on it, a rectangle is just barely 
defined in low-relief; three letters are scribbled inside the figure, &quot;XVI&quot;.

quite a bit deeper into the ground than the others.  The pebbles on the

that direction.  A sand sculpture of some kind is visible on the shoreline

    <editdraftcomments>Wow, don!  This is a really nice room :) just 2 teeny tweaks here.  You 
mention pebbles so much that I wanted it to be a little less redundant, so I 
changed two out for small stones and rocks.  Great imagery here too, it's 
jut lovely

    <editeds>Hehe.  Lovely writing here, I must say :) so creative.  Umm, my only concern 
is in echo #1.  It should be &quot;carries&quot;, not carry, as your subject is 
sounds, which is plural.  Therefore, carries needs to be plural as well.

      <desc>The footprints in the sand appear to have been made by students, some 
barefoot and some wearing shoes, with several prints leading right up to the 
water's edge.  The oversized footprints are each just larger than the size 
of a dustbin lid.  They are much deeper than the other prints, indicating 
that whoever made the prints must have been both large and heavy.  A few 
sugary crumbs of homemade rock cake are lying in the sand next to the large 
footprints.

    <editdraftcomments>Dear Don, this is great writing! I'm so glad you're back! I've edited this room for you, though most of my edits come from the fact that the waterside is actually written to not contain water unless it neighbours the lake (so it's near to a blue room). I've also removed the pillwort - after some research, I found out that it actually resides in dried mud during the summer for example (which on a sandy beach is a hard thing to get). Other than that, just minor edits. Please, however, feel free to tell me if you think I've edited something wrong. Hugs, Cristina

    <editfirstcomments>Hi Cristina.  Okay, in the second draft I just mentioned the lake to the 
southeast - and threw the boulders back in it!  ;-) - to keep it a little 
more clear for players.  I kept out the pillwort, but I wanted to let you 
know that in my research I found that while pillwort is dying out due to a 
decline in number of mining and cattle ponds, it is staging a comeback in 
shallow bodies of water with sandy bottoms.  I thought the Hogwarts Lake 
would be a neat magical place for it to thrive, but I definitely don't mind 
that it's out.  I just didn't want you thinking that I was a slacker who 
wouldn't do his research!  I already changed the echo.  Let me know when I 
can slap a &quot;*&quot; on this bad boy!

</editsecond>
    <editsecondcomments>Dear Don, my only comments are these:
 
1) In sentence three: please change 'in the shallow water and sand of Hogwarts Lake to the southeast' to 'in the shallow water and sand of the southeastern Hogwarts Lake'. After 'Lake' please add a semicolon (the sentence is a bit too long already) and then add: 'the rocks are positively surrounded by [...]'. The sentence should read: 'Large, grey stones - perhaps the vestiges of the centuries-old wall - lie half-submerged in the shallow water and sand of the southeastern Hogwarts Lake; the rocks are positively surrounded by a flourishing colony of sweet-water grasses.' (I've replaced lake by 'sweet-water' since you repeat that 3 times in 2 sentences). 
 
2) I forgot to put a comma between 'narrow' and 'sandy'. Please do that, as you do need the separation between two adjectives.
 
The rest is golden, and I certainly don't take you for a slacker. This is a beautiful room! Hugs, Cristina

    <editdraft>Pale leaves are pendant from the gangly boughs of an burgeoning sycamore.  
The moss on its smooth bark is still soft and green and its spindly thin 
branches look rather lopsided against the broad trunk.  Each long growth 
gently sweeps the clouds across the sky with its brush of large, veined 
leaves.  Some of the southwestern most branches shade the shores of a deep, 
rippling lake, and the tip of a sword ends in the hand of an elegant stone 
woman that is surrounded by water from lapping waves from the lake.  Heavy, 
waving daisy heads are scattered upon the northwestern shore as well.

    <desc>This pasture is so flooded it resembles a paddy field.  Encircled by the 
Hogwarts Lake from the north all the way east and southward, the 
geographical area is not very favourable to the short grass and flowers that 
stretch to the west and northwest.  Resplendent in their beautiful, seasonal 
splashes of colour, these flowerbeds only add more moisture to the thick, 
damp atmosphere.  A sandy beach lies southwest, bordered closely by the 
patient, clear waters of the lake.  On days with a very clear sky, the patch 
receives some shade, both from the somewhat distant, western Outer Wall and 
from the Hogwarts Castle itself, which rises to the north.  Six paths, 
magically dug in the shallow water, lead in every cardinal direction except 
northeast and southeast; these narrow furrows explode from around a 
half-figure sculpted on a pedestal underneath the tranquil mirror of the 
lake.  
</desc>
    <editdraft>This pasture is pretty flooded, much like a paddy field.  This peculiarity 
is born from the area's geographical situation: it is encircled by the 
Hogwarts Lake from the north to the south.  Furthermore, although its 
southwestern border is not directly against the lake, it is only separated 
by another patch from the large body of water.  To the northwest, large 
flower beds only add more moisture to the air.  Directly west, the Outer 
Wall only seems to keep in the damp air, rather than protecting the grounds. 
 The northern shadow of the Castle is too distant to change the situation.  
The six paths, in every direction except the northeast and southeast, are 
only narrow furrows, magically dig into the shallow water.  From amidst the 
wet blades of grass, a half-figure emerges out of the ground and then out of 
the water.

    <editdraftcomments>carole! I'm so pleased that yours was my first room to edit from my tiny break. :) woo! lovely room here, just changed a colon to a semi-colon, and 1 tiny word change towards the end there. I really like how you said the flowerbeds give moisture to the air, very creative and lovely imagery :)
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Your echoes are just lovely here carole, but I did edit both of your eds.  
Your statue was just breathtaking, it was written so well!  :) keep up the 
most excellent work.  `-mira 
 
To add to Mira's lovely words:
 
ECHOES:
 
1) Please change echo number 1 to: &quot;A flash of light strikes the diamond in the pommel of the statue's sword, breaking into a miniature rainbow.&quot;
 
2) I am not entirely sure how the tiara can catch OFF a glint of light. I would suggest rephrasing echo number 2 to: &quot;The statue's tiara catches a glint of light.&quot;
 
3) Please change echo number 3 to: &quot;A ray of sunlight glares off the statue's sword(, striking the water below).&quot;  What is in the brackets is a suggestion more like; I thought it added a nice detail to your lovely ray.
 
4) Please change echo number 4 to: &quot;A miniature wave hits the sculpted figure, almost touching the hilt of its sword.&quot;
 
5) Please change echo number 5 to: &quot;The water lets off a gentle, lapping sound as it swells in the wind&quot;. 
 
EDS:
 
I've edited both your eds. Please add the keywords: &quot;sculpture&quot; &quot;statue&quot; to the &quot;figure&quot; ED and &quot;blade&quot; &quot;weapon&quot; to the &quot;sword&quot; ED.

    <editfirst>This pasture is pretty flooded, much like a paddy field.  This peculiarity is born from the area's geographical situation; it is encircled by the Hogwarts Lake, from the north to the south.  Furthermore, although its southwestern border is not directly against the lake, it is only separated by another patch from the large body of water.  To the northwest, large flower beds only add more moisture to the air.  Directly west, the Outer Wall only seems to keep in the damp air, rather than protecting the grounds.  The northern shadow of the Castle is too distant to change the situation.  The six paths, in every direction except the northeast and southeast are only narrow furrows, magically d(u)g into the shallow water.  From amidst the wet blades of grass, a half-figure emerges out of the ground and then out of the water.

    <editsecond>This pasture is so flooded it resembles a paddy field.  Encircled by the 
Hogwarts Lake from the north all the way east and southward, the 
geographical area is not very favourable to the short grass and flowers that 
stretch to the west and northwest.  Resplendent in their beautiful, seasonal 
splashes of colour, these flowerbeds only add more moisture to the thick, 
damp atmosphere.  A sandy beach lies southwest, bordered closely by the 
patient, clear waters of the lake.  On days with a very clear sky, the patch 
receives some shade, both from the somewhat distant, western Outer Wall and 
from the Hogwarts Castle itself, which rises to the north.  Six paths, 
magically dug in the shallow water, lead in every cardinal direction except 
northeast and southeast; these narrow furrows explode from around a 
half-figure sculpted on a pedestal underneath the tranquil mirror of the 
lake.

    <editsecondcomments>Lovely Carole, you have some beautiful imagery here. I like that you give a good, generalised description of the area before you go into details - like specifying the term paddy field. Awesome! However, there are a few points that are confusing in this desc. 
 
1) You say: &quot;Directly west, the Outer Wall only seems to keep in the damp air, rather than protecting the grounds.&quot; Awesome imagery, but when these people will move west, they won't find the wall and they will be very confused. Please remember to describe the IMMEDIATE exits, too, even if you remind them that far in the distance they will find the wall and the castle.
 
2) Okay, this is just my being a picky mathematician, but you say the area is enclosed by the lake from north to south. Well, there are two equivalent circle arcs that enclose that area: north-west-south and north-east-south. Which one are you taking?
 
3) The desc is a bit confusing at times because, you skip from imagery to imagery a bit fast. It's nice to group them together a bit, because your details are very scrumptious and lengthy. So grouping them doesn't disorient the player so much, I think.
 
A lovely job overall, and please don't hesitate to buzz me if you think i need to change something. `-Cristina

      <desc>A white-marble statue of a woman emerges out the flooded ground here.  It is 
really only a half-statue, seeing as how only the part from the waist up is 
sculpted.  The water laps up to just under the figure's breast, which is 
hidden beneath two plaited panels of material, held together by six round, 
silver clasps on the shoulders, under the armpits, and on each side of the 
narrow waist.  The draped neckline dips only slightly, showing the flimsiest 
hint of cleavage, but accenting the white, graceful expanse of this sculpted 
woman's bare neck.  On her back, however, the cloth plunges beneath her 
shoulder blades, from where two feathered wings explode out, unhindered and 
majestic.  Neither earring, nor bracelet adorns the slender woman; only a 
minute, silver-and-diamond tiara is entwined with her intricate and 
incredibly elegant bun.  The hair-do perfectly compliments her smooth, oval 
face and highlights her blazing expression.  Standing out as the focus of 
the statue is a sword she bears aloft.

      <desc>The statue's right arm is thrust vertically upward and prolonged into the 
equally vertical line of a three-foot long sword.  The weapon's hilt and 
horizontal guard are made of silver, and the pommel is a myriad-faceted 
diamond.  Sharpened into a very keen point, with razor-like edges on either 
side, the blade looks like a pure, elongated, silver tear.  Should it rain, 
the droplets would fall quickly and smoothly along this ancestral sword, 
probably landing on the statue's left arm, which, held close to the body and 
bent at the elbow, lightly skims the water.

    <desc>An explosion of freshness and green, dotted with crimson flowers, stretches 
out in the open.  Delimited by sweet-water pebbles, polished and 
brilliantly-white, a circle stands in the centre of the patch.  Alongside it 
on the exterior are thorny shrubs, as though protecting the inside of the 
circle from passers-by.  Permanent winds breathe through the surrounding 
air, caught within the mystical circle as though through a funnel and 
transformed into a wild, strange song with Celtic resonances.  Mysterious, 
hoof-like beats accompany the music, winding it up or quieting it down as 
though invisible dancers pranced upon the ever-flattened grass.  The scent 
of sweet willow and clear water reaches from the lakeside northeast, 
northeast, and southeast.  The grounds, green and lush, reach out in every 
other direction.

    <editdraftcomments>Loveliest aruna, it's so great to have a room from you to edit!  :) I'm glad 
to see you back.  Just a few comments here.  In your first couple of 
sentences, I just added a word or two for clarification in your writing, and 
in the middle there you had originally written 'lives', which I thought 
maybe you meant leaves?  Anyway, the biggest thing I changed was your 
sentences about the coins.  I think that would work much better as an ed, 
because a player would most likely want to look at the coin some more.  So 
please add this sentence into an ed: (A picture depicting) the king and 
queen dressed in royal robes with sharp edged swords all set to slit throats 
(is shown).  Last comment from me is about your penultimate sentence.  I 
tried to change it a bit so your exits wouldn't be like a shopping list (as 
cris has pointed out to other builders), but feel free to change it if it's 
not to your liking.  And with that, I think this room was really great!  I 
really like the bench too.  :) 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES: 
 
1. Please change your echo to: 'A dark shadow crosses the heavens as day gives in to night; the figures on the chessboard put down their weapons, yawning lazily.'
 
EDS:
 
I am confused about your ed. Where are these coins? You mention absolutely no coins in your desc, so nobody will even think about looking there. If you are referring to the chess set, remember that the pieces of Wizard's Chess, which I assume this is, are NOT coins, but actual pieces, 3-D and all that. Have a look at:  http://www.my-chess-set.com/pictures/WorldWiseChessSetsHardwood/37SOEBM.jpg This should give you a hint about it. Please rewrite this and gimme a shout when you are done. `-Cristina

    <editfirstcomments>Heya mira!  Im a bit confused abt the coins ed.  The suggestion was &quot;(A 
picture depicting) the king and queen dressed in royal robes with sharp 
edged swords all set to slit throats (is shown)&quot; so would it mean that the 
coins are painted with the pics?  Hope i did it rite.  Best-aruna

    <editsecond>In the warmer seasons, the smell of heavily-perfumed, marigold flowers 
spreads here through the air.  The area is splashed in a variety of colours. 
 Flaming-red blooms occupy the eastern corner, their chrome-hued petals like 
blazing, twisted corn.  They lazily rest against each other, their 
olive-coloured, thick stems supporting delicate and beautiful leaves.  To 
the north stands a long, wooden bench made of pure teak.  Pictures depicting 
stone-age life are carved upon it.  In the middle of this patch is a huge 
platform.  On the raised base stands a chessboard.  Grounds stretch far and 
wide to the north, northeast, and northwest, as well as to the west and 
southeast.  The sound of enchanting music is heard towards the east, where a 
white, pebble-delimited circle stands.  A swishing sound of flowing water 
echoes towards the south and southwest.  
</editsecond>
    <editsecondcomments>Lovely Aruna, I've tweaked your desc here. I think my main comment here is this: you have absolutely lovely elements in your descs, but sometimes, you tend to break them up very much, so you end up having a small, new core in each sentence, surrounded by a lot of auxiliary text which is repeated again and again.
 
As an example, take for instance: 'The smell of heavily perfumed marigold flowers spread through the air.  A variety of colours meet the eyes when set upon these blooms.  Flame-red flowers occupy the corner to the east, their petals are like twisted corn as the shade of chrome surrounding them make it feel like a flame is set.  A few of these blossoms creep across to the next plant, as though lazily resting their bones.  Olive-coloured, thick stems support these delicate, beautiful, and pretty leaves.'
 
In this sequence, we find out the following: 1) There are marigold flowers here; 2) these flowers are perfumed; 3) they are variously coloured; 4) there are flame-red blossoms to the east; 5) These flowers have petals like flaming twisted corn; 6) The flowers are entangled; 7) The flowers have olive, thick stems and delicate, pretty leaves.
 
These elements in themselves contain lovely details. However, in your fragment, you repeat elements a lot, and I sometimes have the feeling that I am completely confused by what you are trying to say. I rephrased the fragment as you see in my edit. If you feel that I've been too harsh with your desc, please don't hesitate to tell me, though, and we can sort things out together.

    <editdraftcomments>Phew!  I counted your sentences, and you have 14, which is ok, but then once 
I read through, I discovered you had pasted your desc twice :) and I can 
definitely tell why tina hired you on this room, it's excellent!  Just a few 
comma and singular vs.  Plural changes.  Great work, carole.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Greetings, lovely carole.  For your #0 echo, it should be sparkles, and in 
#1, it should be courses.  I really like #2 :) and last, I've edited all of 
your eds but #2, the paths.  It was lovely :) and you have 'stones' as part 
of your keywords for ed #3, and #4.  When you type just 'look stones', it 
gives you the bench one, just so you're aware.  You can keep 'stones' in #4 
if you wish, I'm just saying that the reader won't get that ed though, 
they'll get the stone one.  If you wanted 'stones' to go with the other, 
then you can fix it if you wish.  :) take care!  `-mira 
 
To add to what the lovely Mira has said,
 
ECHOES:
 
1) Please remove echo number 3, or make the student stand up soon and leave. Otherwise, the players will try to interact with the student, and will be confused when that will fail.
 
2) Please change echo 2 to: &quot;A rune gleams brightly from amidst the distance. After just long enough for the phenomenon to become suspicious, the light vanishes to dull grey.&quot; (The reason why I changed it is that your formulation is just a teeny bit muddled.)
 
EDS:
 
1) in your ed of cromlech, you have &quot;Ed add cromlechs dolmens carved stones doors frames megalithic doorframes&quot; in the actual text of the ed. Please remove that :D
 
2) In the ed of runes, I would suggest removing the last two sentences and making an echo of the last sentence during the night-time. However, I have edited the ed as it is now, so it's your decision what you do, lovely girl. Please let me know, however, if you've written a new echo, so I'll know.
 
3) I've edited all your eds. Please have a look at them when you get a chance.
 
I liked this room and the detail. You put a lot of work into it, and I'm impressed. `-Cristina

    <editsecondcomments>Lovely girl, I have only made very slight modifications.  The part about the 
paths was somewhat confusing and I took the liberty to edit it, interpreting 
it in the way I thought best; if I got that wrong though, please tell me 
about it.  As a more important comment: you have a great gift of setting 
rooms into perspective, like associating Ancient Runes with this patch.  
However, please try to make it sound a bit more related to the content 
rather than a bit of a book (in encyclopaedic style).  And if you think that 
last sentence doesn't make sense, you're probably right.  :P Some good work 
and details in this room, love!  `- Cristina

      <desc>The stones form dolmen, by group of three, two vertical, and a horizontal.  
The rocky beams are humungous.  Their parallelogrammical shapes are 
carefully fitted so there isn't the slightest space between the vertical 
stones and the horizontal one in each set of three.  Though no runes had 
originally been graved on it, traces of recent attempts at carving or 
painting some can be seen.  
 
Dolmen stand everywhere across this patch, made of two vertical stones supporting a third in a flattened archway. The humongous, parallelogram-shaped, rocky beams are carefully fitted so there isn't the slightest space between the vertical stones and the horizontal one in each set of three. The runes carved and painted upon the cromlechs appear much more recent than the structures themselves, as though the engraving began not too long ago.

      <desc>The soil in this patch seems to be finely grounded sandstone, the same that 
was used to carve all the menhirs, dolmens and benches.  So, what can be 
seen between the thick carpet of silvery-blue grass, is also silver and 
softly-glittering.  The paths are covered with the same sparkling powder and 
are lined with pebble-sized, blue-white quartz.

      <desc>The stone benches use the same cromlech pattern as the sort of doorframes at 
the edges of the area.  The vertical stones are obviously less tall, only 
about three-feet high.  Also the capstone is far wider, about six-feet long; 
whereas on the large dolmen the top stone does not protrude from the 
standing ones, on the benches it does on each side for about half of a foot. 
 
These stone benches have the same, cromlech structures as the doorframe-like, flattened arches decorating the entire area. The two vertical stones that serve as feet are obviously less tall, only about three-feet high.  Also, the capstone is far wider, about six-feet long; whereas on the large dolmen, the top stone does not stretch beyond its pillars, it does so on the benches, by about a foot on each side.

      <desc>The menhirs are carved out of silver sandstone, and the mica and quartz 
crystals in them glitter amiably.  Standing more than seven feet high, the 
stones have an oblong, elongated shape, but with a square cross-section; all 
in all, they look like Luxor Pylons with rounded angles and an ovoid top.  
The paths delimit eight somewhat triangular areas; within each of these are 
set twelve menhirs.  The first three are aligned two feet away from the 
round middle of this patch; two feet away from this row are four more 
stones.  The last five stones are placed, yet again, two feet behind the 
preceding row.

    <desc>This patch of grass is nestled securely in a corner of the Hogwarts Outer 
Wall, which extends west and south.  The lake sparkles as it flows from the 
southeast to the northwest.  A light scent lingers from the proximity of the 
flower beds to the north.  Further northwest stands the Quidditch Pitch.  
Eight paths run from all directions through the tall, lush, and green grass. 
 Where they meet, in the centre of the patch, rests the smiling statue of a 
child.  The young girl's smile is so bright indeed that it radiates a gentle 
heat, plunging this patch in a magical spring.  On a small socle, she is 
kneeling, her feet slightly to the side, with flowers in her lap.  She is 
stringing these flowers, a crown already circling her shoulder-length, 
straight hair.  In her lap, protected by the crook of her elbow, also sits a 
deep-red garnet.

gentle, but constant breeze wafts gently around the tree, making its 
branches swing rhythmically.  A small path leading off into all directions 
has been formed by the many students who tread through the grass on their 
way to lessons.

    <desc>Luxuriously stretching eastward and westward, the granite wall towers over 
its surroundings as it creates a barrier between the Lake and the Hogwarts 
Grounds.  A small patch of grass carpets the short, descending ground that 
leads to the glistening water side.  To the north, covering the entire 
surface of the grounds, is a large park, decorated with bushes and, in the 
warmer part of the year, with flowers of all colours.  Dark streaks of 
silver amidst the fresh grass announce the presence of the same kind of ivy 
as the one embracing the surrounding wall.  The Quidditch Pitch and Hogwarts 
Castle, to the northeast, occasionally cast vague shadows upon the patches 
of trees and plants growing at their feet.  Far to the north, the Forbidden 
Forest appears to be the grim, sinister background to an otherwise-peaceful 
painting.  The air is filled with a mixture of sweet and fresh scents.

rhythm of a tumultuous life.

    <desc>Gusts of air of increasing violence seem drawn to this particular section of 
the wall, screaming and clawing at its already rounded surface.  The thick 
ivy draped around it clings tightly to the smooth stone, invading any 
chippings or holes it finds along the way.  The permanent tempests explode 
towards the south, forming small tornados in the deep mirror of the Lake.  
Twisted and battered willows block some of the wind's wrath, their mourning 
branches deeply plunging into the nearby water.  To the north stretches a 
carpet of grass, small bushes and, in season, flowers.  As they reaches 
closer to the wall, the plants decrease is size and are flattened to the 
ground, in an attempt not to attract the attention of the fierce storms.  
Towering above their surroundings, the Quidditch Pitch and the Castle to the 
northeast appear immutable and steady against nature and time.  The wall 
slithers eastward into even more unsettling winds, while regaining some 
measure of peace to the west.

nearby provides ample nesting space for a few birds.  Large enough not to be

unfathomable distances.

to bend to the southeast, closer to the turbulent, stormy surface of the 
lake.  The last, thin fragments of a web of ivy desperately cling to the 
grey granite, while silver stains mark the places where vines have been torn 
away completely.  The edges of the wall are smooth and very rounded by the 
ever-raging tempest, while an unpleasant dampness hangs low in the screaming 
air.  To the north, like overlarge decorations upon a grass carpet, stand 
the Quidditch Pitch and the Hogwarts Castle, draped against the far, dark 
background of the Forbidden Forest.  The wall slithers onward to the west, 
covered in strong ivy, creating a strong barrier around the grounds.

    <desc>Permanent, fierce gusts of fresh wind blow against the rounded, smooth 
surface of the dull-grey wall.  Crawling against the hard stone, gathered up 
in a thickly-woven web, are vines of ivy that appear shy and fearful of the 
breeze.  Their long, silvery arms embrace the barrier tightly, diving 
towards the grass that grows alongside the wall to the north.  The clear 
waters of the lake spread widely to the south, bathing the roots of the old 
granite with occasional, gentle, rocking motions.  Rising northeast, amidst 
a wide park tainted with blood-coloured roses, is the magnificent Hogwarts 
Castle.  To the west, standing much lower, but every bit as beautiful, is 
the perfect parallelepiped of the Quidditch Pitch.  In the far distance, the 
Forbidden Forest covers the horizon in a dark and dangerous stain.  As the 
wall continues to the northwest, the force of the never-ceasing wind turns 
destructive and angry, while to the east, the tempests quieten in favour of 
a reassuring calm.

    <desc>Peaceful and grand, the wall slithers east and west, by the lake side.  
Gentle, clear waters splash occasionally against the dull-grey granite, 
rocked by a fugitive breeze.  A deep freshness lingers in the air, 
occasionally mixed with the damp sweetness of old willows.  Ivy clutches the 
rounded edges of the stone barrier with possessive passion, digging into its 
surface with thin, strong fingers.  To the northeast, rising magnificently 
atop a large carpet of grass, stands Hogwarts, its presence reassuring and 
exuding a strange sense of power.  Neighbouring it to the west, is the 
smaller but exquisite Quidditch Pitch, surrounded by a large, rectangular 
arena.  In season, the park that stretches over the entire Grounds is 
littered with flowers of all colours, from blood-red roses to dazzling-white 
daffodils.  The beauty of the grass fades, however, to the north, as it is 
swallowed by the dangerous, dark depths of the Forbidden Forest.

    <editdraft>The protection of the outer wall, which extends from the west to the 
southeast of this patch of grass, did little to preserve the dead tree 
despondently nestled in its crook.  No trace of a leave, no hint of a bud, 
nor the faintest glimpse of a petal, a seed or a fruit, is left in the patch 
from days long gone, when this tree was still alive and mighty.  Only a 
thick, but yellowing carpet of grass covers the ground.  Seven dirt trails 
start from the tree's roots and scuttle away in all the directions except 
the southwest.  Even the very distant, northern profile of the Hogwarts 
Castle casts a dark shadow on this area.  The eastern Lake sends icy, moist 
drafts of air.  The only brightness in this patch is a bright-blue and 
soft-yellow titmouse and the nest which it has made where the trunk branches 
out; also to the northeast, the scent and colours of the flower beds, in 
season, livens things a bit.

    <editdraftcomments>Awww, I just adore this room!  It's so pretty, and nice, and wonderful.  You 
must have been in a very cheery mood while writing it :D very nice indeed.  
Just a few tweaks.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>No comments for your echoes, other than: lovely, lovely, lovely.  I did edit 
your ed.  Last thing, I think it would be nice if you made an ed for the 
little titmouses's nest, separately.  I'm sure people might want to look at 
it.  If you don't feel like writing one up, and just like the mention you 
give it in your only ed, then please add on keywords to it, so readers can 
see it.  :) thanks so much, carole!  `-mira 
 
EDS:
 
1) About your tree ED, all I can say is: wow, it's amazing. Great imagery there, especially the last part! I only made some small edits, so please check those out when you get the time.
 
2) I think that you need to write a titmouse ED, since you single him out in the echo. I know that if you saw that, I'd definitely look for the little bugger. :D

    <editsecond>This patch of grass is directly bordered and shielded by the Hogwarts Outer 
Wall, which extends from the west to the southeast; though the high, granite 
barrier is immutable and very high, it seems to have done little to protect 
the dead-looking tree that rises in its crook.  Beneath the utterly 
shrivelled branches grows only a thick, but yellowing carpet of grass; 
neither leaves, nor buds, nor the faintest glimpse of petals, seeds, or 
fruit are left from the days when this tree was alive and mighty.  Seven 
dirt trails start from knobbly-looking, dead roots, scuttling away in all 
directions except southwest.  On a particularly good day, glimpses of light 
trace the distant profile of the northern Hogwarts Castle onto the yellowing 
canvas of the grass, while the far, eastern lake occasionally sends icy, 
moist drafts of air.  Amongst these rather glum surroundings, a bright-blue 
and soft-yellow titmouse nesting in the crook of the tree and the seasonal, 
northeastern scents and colours of flowerbeds provide some

    <editsecondcomments>Lovely Carole, you have quite a good room here! However, I think you started a bit abruptly this time. i missed your otherwise so smooth introductions, which bring me right into the spirit of a room! Your wording was great, particularly in describing the deadness of the patch. But I did feel at some points that I wasn't sure where you were going until the sentence was finished. For instance, when you talked about brightness, I had the feeling you were going to mention some sort of light. I suggested some changes here and there, but tried to leave all the vividness you had in this room where it was. Please buzz me if you think I went too far. I loved the atmosphere here, love, thanks so much for all the hard work! `-Cristina

      <desc>This tree is so gnarled and distorted that its species cannot be recognized 
anymore.  The furrowed, wrinkled stem divides into two massive offshoots.  
One has broken off long ago; the missing limb is nowhere in sight.  The 
jagged edge of the open wound reveals, past numerous twists and turns, a 
hollow shaft that goes all the way down to the roots - or what is left of 
them.  The other outgrowth is complete, but does not rise any taller than 
the broken part; this may be due to its numerous contortions.  Brittle, thin 
twigs stand out of the bark like malevolent thorns.  The titmouse's nest is 
tiny, at first sight no more than a thatch of dirty-blonde hair.  In its 
entirety, the tree looks like a man writhing in agony, wringing his arms up 
and opening a dark maw in a silent scream of horror.

    <desc>Trickling from a northeastern rose garden, a couple of blossoms shyly hunch 
apart from the general opulence of this patch of hyacinth.  The plants are 
arranged in rings, only interrupted by the eight, straight paths out; in the 
centre of the concentric circles stands a statue, like a rock creating 
ripples in the middle of a lake.  More grisly, a dead tree stands as a 
barrier to the shadow of an eastern outer wall; the stone structure, not 
deterred so easily, goes around to the south and on to the southwest towards 
a western lake.  As a last, magnificent feature in the beautiful vista, the 
Quidditch Pitch covers the northwestern horizon.  Furthermore, on clear 
days, the proud towers of the Hogwarts Castle are visible to the north, 
beyond the luxuriance of some flower beds.

      <desc>This statue is carved of lapis-lazuli and represents two men, in a position 
reminiscent of a pieta.  One man, quiver and arrows shrugged on, is 
kneeling, another, younger man laying in his stone arms.  The youngster is 
bleeding from a wound to the head; where the sculpted blood touches the 
earth, a hyacinth is carved.  Next to the blossom, a discus lies discarded.

      <desc>. 13.  Around the statue is a ring of alternating grape hyacinths and more 
common hyacinths.  The former can be recognized in season by their almost 
globe-like flowers, so different from the almost lavender-blue, sparse 
flowers of the common kind.  A second ring of plain earth circles this 
flower bed and is the origin of eight paths in all cardinal directions.  
Between these lanes grows in tight rows the garden variety of hyacinth: its 
dense spikes of flowers bloom in spring in fuchsia, red, blue, white, 
orange, pink, violet, yellow, and every hue in between.  This is truly a 
glorious sight, fit to lie beside the rose garden from whence two pale-pink 
ambassadors flower in the northeastern corner; these blossoms are separated 
from the hyacinths by the small patch of earth that represents the width of 
yet another ring of earth.

    <editdraft>Here lies an area filled with bright, vibrant flowers and lush, green grass. The flowers range from pure-white tulips to light blue lilys, there are even some pink carnations spread around sparingly.The leaves on all the flowers are oblong and a deep, healthy green colour. The flower petals are very picturesque with every colour and curl on it perfectly visable. Blades of grass cluster around the flowers bases and roots and point upwards into the sky, waving lightly with every breeze that passes by. To the north stands the Forbidden Forest, living up to it's name with it's dark trees standing out ominously. The Hogwarts grounds stand in the distance with the Quidditch pitch. To the east the waters of the Hogwarts lake sparkles with any light that touches it.

    <editdraftcomments>As ever, Shannon, my sweet, you've written a room full of life and breathtakingly beautiful. I've only edited bits and pieces here and there, particularly spelling errors. As ever, I do recommend you use a Word Processor with spellcheck, as it helps us get rid of some of those. One, small thing though: please make sure that you mention the nearby exits first. Also, make sure you tell people that the Forest, Quidditch Pitch, and lake, are FAR away, since otherwise they might be confused not to find them nearby. Thank you so much for all your efforts, Shannon, you're great! `-Cristina

A wizened hand is the only other visible expanse of stone skin.  The stiff,

    <desc>Many different species of flowers vastly populate the ground, including 
bluebells, daisies, sunflowers, roses, and honeysuckle.  There is also one, 
single, pink carnation stands admist the other flowers.  It is a very soft 
shade of pink with a dark, green stem and two leaves curling upwards towards 
the sun, to consume any light that come their way.  The roots disappear 
beneath the grass, sinking into the soil to soak up nutrients in the ground. 
 The carnation's petals wrap around the stem like those of a rose, but the 
softer, pink petals puff out, giving the impression of a gentle ball of 
fluff.  The flowers continue in every direction.

      <desc>The flower is a very light pink, almost like the a picture found on a Valentine's Day card. The carnation is strangely peaceful-looking among the other flowers. It sways softly every time there is a breeze, unlike the more rapid bobbing of other flowers like the honeysuckles. From above, its many curves and flat 
petals resemble a jigsaw puzzle, but from the side it looks like one small pink pom-pom in the midst of hundreds of other flowers.

    <desc>Healthy, big shrubs grow in rows on this patch of land.  During the daytime, 
the immenseness of the sky looks like an ocean over the beautiful, well-kept 
garden.  Tall, shady trees stand east and west; they lean over the 
plantations, filtering any sunlight.  The shadowy cups of roses flower to 
themselves.  To the north is a stone bench, next to it is a small fountain 
surrounded by ferns, about three feet high; water sprouts from it like 
sparks, thus watering the plants, while being a perfect monument of 
soul-restoring beauty.  The amazing display of blossoms continues north and 
southwest.  A stone pathway covered in dust runs west and northwest, while 
open grounds stretch widely towards the east, south, northeast, and 
southeast.

    <desc>An extensive road is along this way.  Its edges are rough and cracked.  In 
winter it's covered in snow and looks like the milky-way leading to the 
doors of heaven, and icicles cover the trees to the sides.  Frozen water 
droplets make a scenic beauty for this normally dusty pathway.  Tall trees 
grow and few flowering plants grow to the sides, the wild flowers and the 
leaning branches add to the looks.  Gusts of wind blow through the trees 
making the leaves rustle.  This path continues north and southwest.  An 
attractive, breathtaking rose garden is to the east, south, west, northeast, 
and northwest, while wide open grounds are to the southeast.

    <desc>This expanse of grass stretches not far from the eastern Quidditch Pitch; 
towering above the thick, green, vegetal carpet from the west, southwest, 
and south is the high and mighty Hogwarts Outer Wall.  Between these rather 
impressive landmarks, this patch affords a somewhat constricted northern and 
southern view.  A small, but magnificent rotunda rules over the patch with 
an air of dignity and austerity.  Ivy wraps up around it in unruly tendrils 
and large leaves; the plant's stark-green colouring contrasting harshly with 
the white-marble building.  Eight paved, straight, narrow roads lead from 
the cardinal edges of the area towards this cold, impressive monument.  Each 
flight of stairs is bracketed by two slim columns; between every couple of 
steps is a plain banister.  The columns support a lofty dome.  In the centre 
of the rotunda, a statue sits severely on a straight-backed throne.

    <editdraftcomments>Wow, carole!  :) I love this room, great idea with the stairs.  I just took 
out the comma after magnificent, and made stairs steps to make more sense.  
Very good work, keep it up!

    <editeds>Your echoes are just great here, and I did edit your ed with just 3 tiny 
adjustments and 1 added in comma.  Your writing is always a pleasure to

      <desc>The whole attitude of this statue is as stiff and rigid as justice itself, a 
mighty feat, considering the sculpted woman is blindfolded.  She sits 
terribly straight in her stony fixity, perched on the edge of her seat, her 
spine not touching the throne's straight back.  Her legs bend in a right 
angle, one beside the other.  In her left hand, she holds aloft an 
old-fashioned, copper scale, whose plates are perfectly balanced and 
horizontal.  In her right, she maintains an iron-grip on a steel sword, 
making the weapon uncannily vertical.  One side of the blade faces the outer 
edges of this patch; on the other side, a very shallow rectangle is wrought 
out of the metal, and in the figure are etched the letters &quot;VIII&quot;.

    <desc>Two statues occasionally cast a shadow on this patch from the southeast and 
southwest, but even their efforts cannot hide the loveliness of the tree 
here.  To bear the ordinary, even degrading name of &quot;tree&quot;, this beauty has 
certainly not deserved.  Its reddish brown bark, coated with a light-grey 
shine, shields a thin trunk and a widespread set of slender branches.  Due 
to its extremely long and encompassing limbs, this tree is balanced even at 
a twenty-foot height and at least as big a girth.  During spring, this 
perennial beauty enshrouds itself with as pretty assortment of flowers as 
can be.  The blossoms are a shade of vivid pink, and their colour shines out 
so much that the green leaves can barely be seen.  The seasonal grass around 
this crabapple tree is a lush green, in perfect, bright harmony with the 
rest of the patch.  This carpet of grass is frequently decorated with 
fallen, pink petals, which are often carried by the wind in all cardinal 
directions, throughout the rest of the grounds.

    <editdraftcomments>This is a lovely room, Kristina; I barely had any edits at all. Please take a look and don't hesitate to tell me if you think I've overdone it. Hugs, Cristina
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1) Please rephrase echo number [0] to: 'The wind gently carries a sweet scent across the pitch; as the breeze halts, the perfume lingers softly in the air.'
 
2) Please edit echo number [1] to: 'A sudden, chilly breeze swoops through the air, shaking the tree top to its smallest twig.'
 
3) This echo is not quite clear to me. I've given a rephrase of what I thought you meant; if I am wrong, please feel free to rephrase yourself and then let me know about it. 
 
'A sudden shower of bright-blue petals falls from the sky, its origins fully unknown.'
 
Beautiful, beautiful work, lovely Kristina! Well done! Hugs, Cristina

    <desc>This expanse of rock is due south of the Quidditch Pitch.  It lies at the 
eastern end of a west-to-east-oriented bout of an outer wall; this granite 
barrier bends to form the southern boundary of this patch before finally 
pursuing its far, southeastern course.  Towards the east, the large mass of 
a flowerbed barely blurs the horizon.  Eight paths skip along the rocky 
ground here.  Seven of these lead to exits out of this patch; the 
southwestern one, however, does not, stopping before a sculpture that rises 
in the shadow of an inaccessible backdrop - the outer wall.  The work of art 
consists of two statues, that of a woman and that of a dragon.  Though 
carved out of the same stone as the very ground and having a similar texture 
to the wall behind them, they stand out quite vividly, painted in 
contrasting hues.

    <editdraftcomments>You wrote this room very well too, carole!  :) you are definitely a great 
outdoor writer.  I just made the usual grammar edits here for you.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Oooh, I really like your first 3 echoes!  :) very good.  In #4, I think it 
would make more sense if you would please word it: The dragon's claws grind, 
screech, and grit against the rock.  And lastly, in #5, please make 
dissipate dissipates!  And 'in a exasperated' should be 'in an exasperated'. 
 I've edited your first ed, the hat one :) your 2nd is lovely.  Take care, 
and thanks for all of your hard work!  `-mira 
 
Lovely, lovely echoes here, as per your wonderful writing and Mira's awesome editing! Will come back when the eds are edited. Love, `-Cristina

    <editfirstcomments>Yet again I let mistakes in the desc that lead to misunderstanding. So I've edited the draft, not necessarily and exactly like mira suggested, but so what I originally wanted to write was understood.

    <editsecondcomments>Lovely setting here with the dragon! I think the only main thing I did was clear out some of the repetitions and clean out the exits, so they are not confusing (for instance you had the wall head it its &quot;eastern direction&quot; and then something ALSO in an eastern direction; now I KNOW you traced the wall first to the south and then to the east, so I understand your meaning, but I tried to clear it a bit.) Please buzz me if you think anything's off. Lovely work, as ever! `-Cristina

      <desc>Under a rather-flat, wide-brimmed hat, the woman is slender, graceful, 
almost frail.  Her flowing, ethereal dress and long, light cloak only 
emphasize this point, both by their verticality, and their own delicateness. 
 This makes it all the more impressive to see her effortlessly subduing a 
dragon; it is only a baby, but a dragon nonetheless, and a Hungarian 
Horntail.  Barely holding one of the bronze horns down, she still forces the 
beast to lie at her feet.  Moreover, its eyes are lazily closed into two 
slivers of yellow pupils.  The maw is stretched in a smile, or as close to 
it as a reptile mouth can get, and the tail waves idly in the air, much like 
a contented cat.  The lizard-like creature is so relaxed, it looks like it 
could start purring at any second.  Under a rather-flat, wide-brimmed hat,

      <desc>The sculpted headgear represents a very thin, straw hat; in fact, it is so 
thin that, were it a real one and not a statue's, it could not possibly stay 
horizontal, but would yield under its own weight.  The stone version, 
however, is perfectly parallel to the ground.  Since the woman is tall, it 
is quite difficult to look at the top of her hat; but, if that is achieved, 
a shallowly-carved rectangle can be seen, and inside of it, the letters 
&quot;XI&quot;.

    <editdraft>A colony of three-leafed clovers grow amongst the short, stiff grass that 
springs out of the ground here.  They are close and crowded, completely 
obscuring the dirt, their round, white blossoms bobbing and nodding on 
skinny stalks.  Tiny purple violets are spaced throughout the clover patch, 
each with a white streak down their curled petals.  The lush and grassy 
expanse of the Hogwarts grounds lie to the north, east, northeast, and 
northwest, and a monument of strength stands to the west.  The great 
parapets of Hogwarts castle looms overhead in all other directions.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Hey petra, :) I reallllllllly liked your sentence about the violets!  It was 
really well written.  And I took out your sentence about the scented air 
because that would be better off as an echo, here it is: A warm and balmy 
smell imbues the air, wafting away on the lazy zephyrs that swirl through 
the air.  :) otherwise I just made your desc more present tense I think, 
keep up the great efforts!  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Aww, pretty spider!  They are nocturnal though, so maybe you want to change 
around your timing of the echo.  Make it more like,...  9/10pm to 4/5am-ish.

    <editdraft>A young linden sapling is growing here, still covered in tiny, 
cream-coloured buds and sticky sap.  Growing to be quite shapely, its 
branches begin to form a pointed dome at the top.  A spider has made its web 
in the twigs, and the diaphanous silk glistens and sparkles in the dew.  
Even the dead fly wrapped in the gossamer strands adds to the ethereal 
beauty of the green tree.  A patch of clover to the west exudes its sweet, 
heady scent into the fresh air.  The walls of Hogwarts castle lie to the 
south, southeast, and southwest, and the grounds themselves reach out to the 
north, east, and northwest.  To the northeast, the proud statue of a 
Zodiacal archer lies starkly against the horizon.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Overall this room was pretty good!  I changed the tall part in your 2nd 
sentence because you said this was a young tree, so it's still growing and 
not that grand yet.  Also, I looked up the definition of 'linden', and it 
told me it has heart-shaped leaves and cream-colored flowers.  I don't know 
if you want to change your 'green buds' to what I just mentioned, but I 
thought it was pretty cool this tree had those features!  :) last, I'm not 
sure about the web glistening in the dew.  That would mean there'd have to 
have been rain or something, and so I'm not sure if that will work out.  No 
doubt, cris will fix it if it's a problem.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>The only thing I'm worried about here is like in your last room, I'm not 
sure a bird would be out at 1am (unless it was an owl).  `-mira

</desc>
    <editdraft>The dirt path that rolls across the bumpy ground here is interrupted by the 
remnants of an ancient wall rising up out of the ground, intersecting the 
narrow trail at an angle.  The wall is only about a metre tall, or two of 
the massive yellow bricks with which the wall was constructed, and half a 
metre wide.  It sprawls across the ground in a thin line, and the tufts of 
grass near its edges have grown tall and allowed some weeds to sprout up.  
In several places, the brick is coated with moss or young ivy creepers just 
starting to make their way up the wall.  The top is well-worn and smoothed 
from being sat on, and there are several names carved into the soft bricks.  
There are several of the large bricks lying on the grass near the wall 
itself, from having fallen off long ago when the grout decomposed.  The path 
continues on both sides of the wall.  An inkwell lies in the grass nearby, 
abandoned by its owner.  The statue of a centaur to the north rises up 
taller than the wall, while a linden sapling grows in the west and the 
Hogwarts Wall directly south, southeast, and southwest casts a shadow over 
everything.  The bumpy land here smoothes out to the east and dips down.  
There is another statue northeast and flowers grow rampant in the northwest.

    <editdraft>The ground dips down on all sides here to form a small depression in the 
land.  The imposing figure of the Hogwarts Wall to the south and southwest, 
the three statues to the northwest, north, and northeast, and the 
dilapidated wall to the west bracket and contrast this almost completely 
bare patch of land on three sides.  The ground is covered in a short hedge, 
only about half a metre high, that spirals inward innumerable times before 
coming to an end in the centre of the depression and giving way to a thick 
pole about a metre tall.  The point of this grey brick pole is unclear; it 
has a flat top, but is barely wide enough to support someone sitting on it, 
and there are no engravings visible.  The narrow, dusty path that runs east 
and west through here takes the long way around the hedge formation, 
choosing to go around, rather than through, the closely packed shrubs.  
While it curves around the northern side, after it completes its break from 
the normal path it straightens out and continues along its former route, 
running east and west.  To the east, it leads to another parcel of Hogwarts 
grounds.  To the southeast, the wall curves away further south, and in what 
would have been its place if it had continued in a straight line, a dead 
tree rises up forlornly from the ground.

      <desc>This pole stands about a metre tall, and is comprised of small grey bricks.  
It is fairly thick, though, with enough room for one to spread his or her 
hand on the flat top of the pole and not have their fingers go over the 
edge.  The base is even wider, as it tapers near the top.

    <editdraft>Sparkling and glittering, the ground here is covered in glass, but not 
accidently; each piece has been carefully placed and arranged.  Countless 
pieces of blown glass art in the shapes of flowers, shrubs, suns, animals, 
and even a few famous wizards have been created for this glass garden.  Each 
piece is infused with the appropriate colors.  This patch of land is divided 
into two halves, each containing these priceless glass sculptures; in 
between, a wide path provides a passageway to take when admiring the 
artwork.  The path itself is made of one solid sheet of transparent glass, 
and for tired feet, a perfectly clear glass bench has been placed to one 
side, in a perfect spot to sit and admire blooming orchids, roses, tulips, 
and daisies, all made of glass.  There are glass crickets and chipmunks, and 
even a few transparent weeds growing.  The air is perfumed with the scent of 
these flowers, despite being just works of art.  A hedge is visible to the 
east, while three statues impose from the northeast, north, and northwest.  
A burble of water can be heard from the east, while a dead tree shadows the 
glass garden from the south.  The southwest holds only the wall surrounding 
Hogwarts, while the grounds continue on to the southeast.

    <editdraftcomments>Just a few spelling things here for you chris, and I put in a few words for 
clarification.  I just really love this glass garden!  It's almost like a 
dream, it's so pretty.  I'm impressed.

    <editeds>Your bench here is just gorgeous.  I want one for my backyard!  Hehe :) well 
done, no edits here.  `-mira

    <desc>Near the lake lies the blooming rose garden.  The beauty of the garden is 
magnified by the different rose bushes, that clutter close to each other in 
colours of blush, pale yellow, and crimson.  The flowers are enchanted to 
grow overlarge; they are the size of a human fist.  The bushes have long, 
olive-green, pointed thorns.  The magical blossoms endure all year along.  
The beauty of the garden is enhanced when snow drapes the blossoms in 
season.  The plants grow in red soil.  The garden extends towards the north. 
 A stone pathway stretches through the east and the northeast, while open 
grounds are in all other directions.

    <desc>Shadows of tall trees stand like muted guardians over this already-dark 
pathway.  The road here is like a smooth velvet carpet covered in clay and 
leaves.  Nearby white flowers shine like ivory on the wild bushes.  The 
place is noiseless, as the thick vegetation absorbs all the sound.  This 
pathway runs north.  The heavy perfume in the air precedes the rose garden 
the east, west, and northeast, while open grounds stretch infinitely in all 
other directions.

    <desc>Beautiful rose blossoms spread through this area.  The shrubs are about 
three feet high.  Their smell has an enchanting power; it spreads through 
this place with the wind.  These symbols of love, peace, and friendship seem 
to carry messages in their beauty.  Shaded in pink, ochre-yellow, and 
pearl-white, the colours are expressive.  Deeply shaded in the interior, 
their intense hues fade towards the exterior edges.  About twenty petals 
cling to every, single flower.  Few of them are buds, under the careful and 
cautious watch of Mother Nature.  In the early hours of the day, dew 
droplets settle upon the roses, making them breathtaking.  This garden 
extends towards the north.  A stone pathway is towards the west and the 
northwest, while wide open grounds stretch like a huge ocean of earth in all 
other directions.

    <desc>Rippling like a swaying sea frozen in its everlasting dance, the ground here 
is irregular and bumpy, covered in a carpet of soft, brown soil and 
seasonal, green grass.  A group of trees are gathered east, around a larger 
oak, like students attending a lecture that has taken more than fifty years 
to finish.  Underneath the patch are three benches buried deeply within the 
ground; tracing their wooden frames are scribbles and twigs.  To the west 
and northwest, the ground is covered with bushes; in season, these bleed 
crimson roses, wreathing the air in heavy, sweet scent.  To the south stands 
the lonely, majestic statue of a lonely, tall gargoyle; the southeast leads 
into the gentle waters of the Hogwarts Lake.  In all other directions are 
wide, infinite grounds.

The centre bench has a chunk taken out of it, possibly unrelated to the sign

lower their boughs protectively over the wooden seats, as though recognizing 
the fibre these were made of.

    <desc>This patch of sand is enclosed between two different areas.  From the 
northeast, down to the south, the dark waters of a lake breathe out a cold, 
damp draft while the vast grey of a southeastern, outer wall isn't helping 
much in cheering the atmosphere.  Somewhat uplifting, however, are the 
flowerbeds to the north, west, and northwest, although the seasonal, 
northern blooms are shaded by the formidable Hogwarts Castle.  The present 
patch reconciles both the dullness of stone and the vibrant tones of life.  
The ground is made of soggy, compacted, muddy-brown sand, and only sparse 
tufts of grass grow out of it.  On the other hand, the dark-hued sand serves 
as the perfect background for hundreds of pale, light-catching shellfish of 
all forms, sizes, and colours..  Eight paths are carefully cleared of any 
shellfish, so these vivid echoes of life would not be trampled; large, 
tortoise shells are set in the shallow furrows.  The layout is beautiful, 
but treacherous, as the smooth, wet shells are slippery.

    <editdraftcomments>carole, really good work here, just a few typo's (but I understand your keyboard or Word spellcheck might be difficult to correct those :) also, make sure everything is in present tense (I noticed this in other rooms as well). other than that, you're doing awesome! :D

    <editeds>Your echoes here are really great carole, :) I just love the first one.  
Amazing imagery and word choice.  `-mira 
 
ECHOES: 
 
In echo number 0, I am unclear of how the blades of grass can wield in the wind. To wield assumes handling, and I think the wind would wield the blades and not otherwise? How about using &quot;writhe&quot; instead? I love that word, writhe. `-Cristina

    <editsecondcomments>This patch was lovely, though at times, a little bit muddled. I cleared some of the more awkward phrasing and edited out some repetitions. If I did something wrong though, please buzz me, love! Awesome work here, and I liked your shellfish. Nice, fragile, and beautiful! `-Cristina

    <desc>A bright patch of seasonal flowers lies here peacefully.  They come in many 
different shades, from a deep, Mediterranean-sea blue, to a sun-like yellow. 
 The flowers range from daisies to carnations, and come in all shapes and 
sizes.  They are all filled with life, and their vibrant colours attest to 
their being well-cared for.  The leaves that stick out of the sides of these 
plants are a deep-green, oblong and tilted towards the sky.  The flowers are 
clustered together, trying to beat each other to any sunlight that may come 
near it, trying to grow taller and taller, while sheltering the grass below 
them in a nice shade.

    <editdraftcomments>Dear Shannon, I like the flowers you describe here, very much. However, I think that a great part of this desc would be better off as an ed. At the same time, it would be interesting to know the texture of the earth here, what the vista is like, and most importantly, the exits. If you run out of ideas, also explain some panoramic points, like whereabouts HW is with respect to this place. The flowers though, are really awesome. I could nearly smell their perfume ... did I tell you I LOVE carnations? Much love, Cris

    <desc>Different shades of roses bloom in this beautiful piece of land.  They bloom 
out of their buds like a pearl from an oyster shell.  The petals are as soft 
as velvet, emitting a heavily enchanting perfume.  In daytime, the blossoms 
bask in the daylight.  To the south is the marble statue of a beautiful 
damsel, dressed in a long flowing gown and pouring water on the plants.  
When the sun sets, the last rays of warmth are cast upon the stone maiden.  
The smile on her face is eye-catching.  During dusk, the blossoms close upon 
themselves like lovers embrace.  The thick mass of red amongst the green 
foliage brightens the look of this already delightful place.  This lovesome 
garden continues to the north, southeast, and southwest.  A stone pathway is 
towards the east, south, and northeast, while dusty grounds extend west, 
northwest.

    <desc>Many extravagant and picturesque flowers grow here. They stand proudly on their thin green stems, saluting the sky with there deep, green petals, happy to be alive. They come in many shapes and sizes and look very healthy, and few flowers are wilting. Their roots are sunk deep into the ground and branched out so that they can only be uprooted by the biggest rain storm. They group together protectively, shielding each other from unwanted heat and creating shade for the smaller flowers. They march off in every direction. 
</desc>
    <editeds>Your echo should be &quot;A bird cries out in the distance.&quot;
</editeds>
    <editfirstcomments>A couple of remarks, although the room's nice:
 
1) Green petals? Either these are special flowers, so please make an ed (and post them on the forum, here: http://lumos.mugglenet.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6506); or you meant their leaves. ;)
 
2) You should mention the mass of the flowerbeds to the east, northeast, north, and southeast; you should also mention the bulk of the Quidditch Pitch a little way to the west. Although it's probable they were written after this room, you may even add something about the three statues are visible right next to this vnum (type exits to see them and their directions). In any case, the flower bed and Quidditch Pitch should be mentioned here.
 
3) Also add mention of the paths or exits, which may be a good way to write about the Flower Beds and QP.

west and the Hogwarts Lake to the east.  Further away, an imposing castle is 
outlined against the northern sky, while the southern vista is blocked by an 
outer wall.  The ground pitches slightly down into a shallow, bowl-shaped 
slope that is centred around the middle of this patch.  Water has seeped 
from the lake, forming a small pond in this natural recipient.  Two humanoid 
statues stand in this pool, and water lilies mill around their ankles.  From 
around the edge of these sculptures, eight paths run through the lovely, 
pastoral grass, amidst some small clusters of daisies.

with the british spelling of centred, and I just threw in a comma or two, 
and changed some of the endings to your words.  I love your outdoor rooms, 
carole.  They're always magnificent.

    <editeds>'I've edited your ed here, just tiny adjustments.  And my only comment for 
your echoes is on #2, to have moits be moist :P that's all!  Good work,

ECHOES:
 
Please write Lake with a non-capital in the last echo.
 
EDS:

      <desc>Both these statues are carved out of white marble and clad in roman togas.  
The statue on the western side is an angel, as bespoken by its two, 
feathered wings; the one on the eastern side is a woman.  The celestial 
being holds a small amphora and pours water out of it, onto the 
outstretched, right hand of the lady.  From there, the liquid trickles down 
into the pond.  The jug continuously lets out its content and still never 
empties out.  It has another peculiarity, as a part of it is rectangular, 
and not smoothly curved like the rest of its surface.  Within this flat pane 
are the engravings of three letters: &quot;XIV&quot;.

    <desc>. Many flowers are dispersed all over this area.  Some of the blooms are 
bright orange and pink, with shiny petals; others are dull-surfaced and dark 
shades of purple or navy.  The flowers are compirsed of from daisys, 
bluebells, and honeysuckle to sunflowers, foxglove and primrose, a very 
sunny flower.  Daisies, bluebells, honeysuckle, sunflowers, foxgloves, and 
primroses grow amidst vividly-green blades of grass.  The leaves are mostly 
facing upwards, but curve downwards towards the end, like a spiral.  The 
Hogwarts grounds stretch in eight directions.  Off in the west there is a 
beautiful rose garden, and off in the north is the towering Hogwarts castle.

    <desc>A bunch of roses, looking like smiling faces, greet people on entering this 
wonderful patch of earth.  An envelope of rare beauty drapes around them 
like a coating.  Magically-mystifying fragrance spreads through the air.  
The well-drained, fertile, maroon soil makes a perfect bed for these 
delicate and wonderful blossoms.  Their yellowish-orange shade looks like a 
flame of gold, glowing with all its might while the reddish pink colour 
looks like faded velvet.  Soft ripples of water blow over the plants from a 
nearby fountain, making them shine like bright rubies.  This awesome garden 
extends south and northwest.  Dusty grounds roll open towards north, east, 
northeast, and southeast, while a stone pathway runs west, and southwest.

    <name>* Path through the Rose Garden</name>
    <copyright>Copyright © 2006  Aruna Vadlamani &lt;aruna221189@gmail.com&gt;</copyright>
    <desc>A long, wide pathway covered in dust lies here.  It looks like a way that 
will end only at infinity.  Deep, mystic scent of flowers fills the air.  
The road is not quite smooth; small pebbles and rough-edged rocks are 
scattered on it.  Green foliage of old, firm, and tall trees create a false 
ceiling, blocking any sunrays in daytime.  After dusk, moonlight and the 
shine of stars are the only sources of light in this area.  
Differently-shaped leaves lie on the ground.  This rough and stern path runs 
south and northwest.  An enchanting rose garden is to the north, east, west, 
southeast, and southwest, while wide open grounds stretch endlessly to the 
northeast.

    <editdraftcomments>This one's pretty good carole, I like the cupid statue.  I think all I did 
was put in 2 comma's, and made a semi-colon a comma.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>For your echo #0, it should be 'trespassers', but would people always be 
walking by here 24/7?  You have it running all day.  I would suggest making 
that to times that students are allowed out on the grounds.  Your other two 
are great, and I did edit both of your eds (just 1 edit I think in the 
first).  Take care.  `-mira 
 
Lovely Carole, I've also glanced at your echoes, and please feel free to leave the hours like this; if someone's out to see them, then they're the ones breaking Hogwarts rules :D.
 
ECHOES:
 
1. Please change echo number 0 to: &quot;The statues critically glance across their territory; their cold eyes seem intent on spotting any and all intruders.&quot;
 
EDS:
 
1. Lovely Carole, I've edited both your eds and I've left comments under your ed of the Cupid. Overall, a great job; I've edited out some of the more muddled bits. Please have a look whenver you have a free moment. `-Cristina

    <editfirstcomments>Well, I thought about echo 0 and its hours.  Eventually, I decided, that if 
someone is seeing the echo, thus they are visiting the path and could be 
considered a trespasser.  Hence, why I have it running all day.  Now, that's 
how I reasoned; Just tell me if it makes sense or if you'd rather I change 
the hours.  In the end, I've rewritten it so it makes more sense though.

      <desc>This group of statues consists of two women and a man standing in-between 
them.  One of the female sculptures is young and beautiful, her silky hair 
unbound and free as she beams happily at the man, a hand half outstretched 
towards the male figure.  Barely out of puberty and clearly enjoying the 
attention, the boy is standing with feet so wide apart that his toes reach 
underneath his broad shoulders; each foot is oriented towards a different 
woman.  While his torso leans in towards the gorgeous maiden's tempting 
fingers, his gaze is intently and resolutely fixed on the other female 
figure.  This second woman is wearing a velvety headgear that covers every 
last strand of hair, as well as the top of her forehead; a veil is caught 
between her temples, hiding her lower face.  In her conservative clothing, 
this girl is ageless and secretive, her eyelashes dark and inviting, her 
eyes twin pools of mystery.

      <desc>This birch tree is slim and tall, and most of its branches are turned 
upwards.  One is not, however; it extends horizontally, right above the 
group of three statues.  Near the trunk, a rectangle is carved out at the 
root of this outgrowth, and the letters &quot;VI&quot; are scribbled in the geometric 
figure.  From the tip of the troublesome branch hangs a chubby, stone 
cherub, only wearing a loincloth; an arrow is strung in his sculpted bow, 
aimed at the group of motionless figures below.  The Cupid's eyes are vivid 
as they target its victim: the only male statue in the trio.

    <desc>Petra's Floral Delevery, Inc., has roped off this area in preperation for a huge and beautiful flowerbed.
</desc>
    <editdraft>Lying here on the soft earth is a huge, midnight-purple-hued flower.  Its 
five velvety petals are wide at the base and taper to a crinkled point, 
veined with streaks of pure white.  The yellow centre is broad; stems of 
pollen spring from it and wave in the breeze.  A short, fuzzy stem supports 
the weight of the immense, flower head.  Similar blossoms dot the landscape, 
nestled in their bed of dark-green, pointed leaves.  The rolling expanse of 
the Hogwarts Grounds stretches to the east, west, and northeast.  Standing 
proudly to the north and northwest are two old, wizened statues.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Petra, I really enjoyed this room!  Your first sentence ended a bit 
awkwardly to me so I tried to make it flow better, and then same thing in 
your last sentence.  :) I tried to keep your thoughts without changing it 
too much, but let me know if you have any concerns.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>These echoes are absolutely perfect. Awesome job! `-Cristina

    <editsecondcomments>I only had one or two minor tweaks here, grammatically speaking. However, I did change your last sentence somewhat towards the end, because I saw that Carole made a point of NOT mentioning the names of the statues in her desc. Therefore, I've added just a tinge of mystery to the whole thing. Otherwise, a fine, fine effort, lovely Petra! `-Cristina

    <desc>Towards the south rises a huge, rough, and solid wall, made of shaded, beige 
sandstone.  Tall blades of grass sway in the direction of the lashing wind.  
On looking upwards, a stand is seen.  With the capacity to accommodate a 
large number of people, the stand is rooted to the earth.  The stand has the 
capacity to accommodate a large number of people.  Some distance to the 
wall, sketch of quidditch players, goal hoops, the balls are etched on a

    <desc>An immense sandstone wall towers over the area, giving protection to the 
grounds from the Quidditch pitch to the south.  The wall, aged and worn from 
the decay of time, carries a history and an awe-inspiring feel like none 
other.  Engraved upon the surface of the wall, the initials G.W. and H.P. 
reside, giving life to a once secret school infatuation.  Standing firm 
opposite the wall, a large golden Impontious tree drips the sweet nectar 
prized by all.  The statue of Neptune gleams proudly to the north, and a 
gentle stream of water trickles around the statue and into the area.  The 
northeast holds the proud and magnificent statue of Uranus, a large canopy 
protecting the statue from the damaging rays of the sun.  To the east and 
the west, the considerable beige wall extends, giving protection to passers 
by from ongoing Quidditch games.

      <desc>In the summer, golden drips of sweet nectar fill the grounds in a flood of 
syrupy stickiness.  The Impontious tree is the size of an average tree but 
produces a sweet substance sought by many world famous chefs.  The 
substance, known as Shafri, is ten times sweeter than honey, and, if 
consumed directly from the tree, creates a mind-altering experience for the 
taster.  Come wintertime, the tree is unable to drip the sugary substance 
from the branches, but stores the substance until it explodes from the top 
on the first day of spring.

    <desc>Many flowers are running along the ground, including lilies, bluebells, daisies and other flowers. They are tightly packed together, making a beautiful bouquet of flowers in many different shapes and sizes. Their petals and leaves, no matter what shape they are, seem to always be looking for any sign of sun, and snatching it up whenever they can. Their roots are sunk deep into the ground soaking up any nutrients they can get. The smell of sweet pollen from the flowers still lingeres around in the air; the smell is very soft, easily blocked out by other smells. Many flowers branch off in every other dieraction although in the east there is a very large tree.

    <editeds>Please add a period to the echo. It would sound better rephrased like such: &quot;A bee softly buzzes along.&quot;
 
 
I know the building guidelines only ask for at least one ed or echo in each room, and no more than five echoes in most cases. I still feel this one echo is not enough, mostly because it won't run all day long: a player out at night (be it a student cutting curfew or a teacher) could stand here for hours without any animation. Unless you're trying to give an effect of &quot;still life&quot;, I'd like to see one more echo, running all day and night long (for example, an earthy smell drifting up)

    <editfirst>In season, many flowers are running along the ground, including lilies, 
bluebells, daisies and other flowers.  They are tightly packed together,

The smell of sweet pollen from the flowers still lingers around in the air; 
this scent is very soft, easily blocked out by other smells.  Many flowers 
(follow the eight, narrow paths and) branch off in every other direction,

    <editfirstcomments>Hello!
 
The desc is mostly golden.  I corrected a few typos (lingeres, diarection, abscent comma before although).
 
Also, for now I'm adding a mention of &quot;in season&quot;, althought the new engine (which may be running by the time you edit this room) won't require it. 
 
Finally, I suggest you mention some paths or exits to show the player they can leave in any direction.

    <desc>The Quidditch Pitch majestically stands nearby here, to the northwest.  Due 
east, a messy, lively mass of flower beds is dimly outlined.  Far north, the 
solemn silhouette of the Hogwarts castle is visible, while to the south, the 
panorama is blocked by the outer wall.  The statue of a four-legged beast 
occupies a cage in the centre of this rocky patch.  From its feet, eight 
silvery paths wind in every direction.

      <desc>The cage is a heavy-set cube cast out of a black, lumpy, rough metal.  The 
flat bars are as sharp as any knife, efficiently protecting the watcher from 
the beast they hold behind.  On the northern face, a sign is set up on top 
of the confinement; a mark resembling an 'm' ending in a swooping, arrowed 
tail and an inscription reading 'Scorpius, the Scorpion'.

      <desc>The dark-grey, almost-black, rocky ground is so wind-smoothed that it has a 
sheen to it; this lustre is somewhat amplified by the microscopic crystals 
imprisoned in the greywacke stone.  The wind and the cold, however, have 
also cracked the stone and sharpened the ridges of these minute crevasses, 
where leaden-coloured, limaille-like dust has accumulated.  Among this 
forbidding background slither eight two-foot-wide paths made out of a 
silvery, liquid-looking metal that nonetheless is very solid to the touch.

      <desc>The caged beast is a Manticore, a male one, judging by its human-looking, 
tanned face; a small, trimmed, black beard outlines its thin lips, but it 
doesn't extand onto the cheeks.  An equally-black mane of shoulder length 
hair frames and hides the transition into a golden lion's body.  This body 
bears sharp, black, glistening claws, but the deadliest part of it is the 
scorpion-like tail.  Segmented, black, and toughly-armoured, it rears up and 
forward, so that the stinger hangs loosely above the head: thus, the 
Manticore is able to stab anyone coming too close.

to the east, the horizon is seasonally blurred by the frivolous mass of a

    <editsecondcomments>ok, so apparently I'm a blurting newbie, so I managed to delete the second comment when wanting to acknowledge it... I'll do some push-ups as punishment, I promise.
 
What I wanted to say before my blundering, was that I changes &quot;giddy&quot; to &quot;frivolous&quot;. I hope it's ok.

      <desc>The brazen hair of the statue is pinned in an elegant bun by a white 
barrette consisting of a solid, plain, horizontal bar below an arched one.  
In her dainty, enamel-blushing face, her aureate irises shine lively, and 
her equally aureate lips smile timidly.  Her bun reveals her naked, milky 
neck and shoulders.  A little, bronze brooch stands on the cleavage of her 
alabaster dress; there, the hairpin motif is repeated, together with a tiny 
inscription reading: &quot;Libra, the Scale&quot;.  From it, the fabric radiates down 
to pool at her feet and sideways to wrap over her biceps, whence it 
continues into slit sleeves.  Because her elbows are propped up, the extra 
material, pulled down by tiny, metal beads woven at its end, hangs down.  
Thus, it almost looks like the woman is holding flimsy platters, while her 
body represents the centre of a scale.  Her marble forearms appear quite 
nude, with her coppery nails bringing a final touch of colour.

      <desc>This wall is simple enough: the yellow-brown bricks along it are drawn 
together with bright-white joints.  The top is adorned with a long, white, 
cement tablet that protrudes half an inch on each side of the four-inch-wide 
wall.  The barrier is about as wide as it is high, neither useful as 
obstacle, nor as protection.  Its sole purpose seems to be to provide 
support for the statue leaning on it.  The wall moves along east and west.

any case, it offers a sweet contrast to the overly white and copper ensemble

examination, it seems they were recently, very neatly cut; the ends are not 
pointy and smooth, but horizontal and slightly ragged.

nonchalantly slither away.

    <desc>This pure-white patch is neatly bordered to the east and southeast by the 
fresh-scented earth of a garden.  The flowerbed's seasonal explosion of 
heavy-scented, crimson-hued roses contrasts deeply with three sombre 
silhouettes to the north, west, and south of the tall castle, the large 
Quidditch Pitch and a portion of the outer wall.  Severe in their 
motionless, steady vigil, these distant guardians echo the stillness of a 
marble, female sculpture set in the centre of this patch.  From the woman's 
feet, eight paths drift unobtrusively along the rocky ground, leading in all 
the main cardinal directions.

directions.  In the centre stands the tall, marble statue of a woman.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>teeny tiny few adjustments here, overall very good carole! :) I love your writing, I always enjoy it.
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Your echoes are great here, just for #2, I think it should be 'brightly from 
the' to make more sense :) and I've edited both of your eds.  Please make 
sure you're writing in present tense, and remember the rules for a/an (if 
the next word begins with a vowel, use an).  Also for using are/is, if your 
subject is plural, use are, singular, use is.  Thanks so much!  `-mira 
 
To add to the lovely Mira's comments:
 
ECHOES:
 
1) Please change echo number 0 to: &quot;A ray of light is reflected brightly off the marble ground.&quot; By the way: you mention rocky ground in the desc; in this echo you had it as smooth ground. How can the ground be both?
 
EDS:
 
I have edited both your eds. The one with the woman was excellently detailed and very well written; I hardly had to change anything in it. Well done! `-Cristina

    <editsecondcomments>Lovely Carole, this room was slightly short, and the exits were a bit confusing, since you had a flowerbed instead of a rose garden, and you mentioned the wall, the castle, and the Quidditch Pitch without saying how far they were. I would suggest rephrasing that part (and I put in the second edit slot what I would rephrase the desc like). Please feel free to either accept the changes or make some of your own, and, as ever, don't hesitate to buzz me if there are any things that you think I was too harsh on. You amaze me with your work capacity; thank you so much for everything you've done! `-Cristina

      <desc>The marble of this statue is smoothed to perfection; not a dent mars it.  
Even the sculpted woman's short hairs are drawn tightly in a tiny bun, not a 
strand straying.  The girl is attired like a Roman Vestal.  Over an 
ankle-long skirt is an upper vestment; leaving one shoulder nude, this cloth 
wraps over the other and flows down to above the knees.  A girdle completes 
the outfit; in the centre of it is a sign, which is repeated on her 
forehead.  The mark represents a kind of flowing-scripted &quot;M&quot; adjoined with 
a &quot;P&quot;.  The girdle also bears the inscription &quot;Virgo, the Virgin&quot;.  In her 
hands, the marble woman holds a small virginal, which is a legless, 
rectangular kind of harpsichord.

      <desc>The eight paths here stand out from the ground only because they are carved 
half of an inch into it.  Otherwise, the trails and the rocky soil are made 
of the same, spotless, pure-white marble.  Not even a speck of dust lingers 
here.  The separation between the lanes and the surrounding, harsh surface 
is perfectly sharp and rectangular, tracing the outline of the paths.  Only 
the central statue on this patch breaks the monotony of the unblemished, but 
lifeless place.

which display a stunning range of colours, nearly the entire spectrum.  The 
shrubs are trim and well-maintained.  Buds and sharp thorns protect the 
flowers like a moat around a fortress.  Some of the blooms are of the hybrid 
variety; they are shaded light-pink and deep yellow, while some are deep 
saffron, and slightly red in colour.  The petals curl around each other like 
coiled springs.  The garden stretches south and northeast.  Wide open 
grounds are towards the north, west, and southwest while a stone pathway 
extends east and southeast.

    <desc>Surrounded by trees on both sides is a pathway covered in dry leaves.  This 
broad road bends as it runs forward, just like a heated metal rod.  In 
autumn, multi-coloured flowers and differently-shaped leaves create an 
ever-changing mosaic upon the almost always dirty pathway.  Bird droppings 
cover the path.  A faint smell of the woods can be sensed.  Roses in 
different shades and colours mushroom out of the earth in the garden which 
is to the north, east, west, southeast, and southwest.  This road continues 
to the south and northeast, whilst wide open grounds stretch towards the 
northwest.

    <desc>Fragrant, majestic roses bloom in this patch of land.  Shades of crimson, 
pale-yellow, and milk-white decorate the petals in thick, intense colours.  
Each flower seems to depict an element of nature.  Emerald-green, lustrous, 
pointed thorns shine with all their might; they vary in size: some are huge, 
while others are really small.  Each, tiny, curled lobe carries more beauty 
than the former.  A pathway of stone runs north, west, and the southwest.  
Wide open grounds roll towards the east and southeast, while the garden 
stretches south, northeast, and northwest.

    <editdraft>A lingering, heavy, strong aroma of roses in full bloom seasonally falls 
like a burden against the smooth, level patch of ground here; to the 
northwest, spreading in sharp, spidery, ink-like patterns, are hundreds upon 
hundreds of fierce, proud rosebushes.  To the north, northeast, west, and 
southwest are wide, luscious grounds covered in flowers and grass during the 
warmer part of the year.  By contrast, this fragment of the Hogwarts Grounds 
is pale and bald all year round, with the exception of a single row of 
seasonal daisies to the very north; a single, twisted oak stands, contorted, 
in the very centre.  Forbidding in its everlasting grief, the tree is always 
moaning in a low, grumbling voice that makes the very earth rumble and 
shiver in return.  A board dangles like a hanged man from one of the lower 
branches.  Like a bright sliver of hope, a lovely waterside spreads east and 
south; kissing the southeastern edge of this patch is the clear water of the 
Hogwarts Lake.

    <editdraftcomments>umm, if you couldn't tell, I didn't make any corrections on your desc. :) it's written very well, and I LOVE THE DAISIES! :D *huggles you*
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Lovely cris, your echoes are fantabulous, no corrections.  I did change your 
board ed.  The only thing I did to it was add a comma before 'two years 
afterwards', because you have so many numbers, it'll be easier to read and 
understand if there's that slight pause.  :) take care.  `-mira

      <desc>This oak appears old beyond its years; its bark, although occasionally 
scarred and torn into bloodless gashes, shows unexpected vitality around its 
youngest branches.  It stands low and contorted, almost crouched against the 
ground, as though cowering from some unseen enemy; the trunk emits 
occasional, lugubrious moans, as though every few moments, another part of 
it has died.  Hanging from a lower branch is a wooden board.  Scribbled upon 
it are a few, jet-black letters explaining: 'This is the Rumbling Oak, 
planted here by Cornelius Aurelius Wocket while he was expecting the results 
of his end of sixth year exams.  The Hogwarts staff reduced their grading 
period from four to two weeks, two years afterwards.

    <desc>The overwhelmingly sweet perfume of a rose garden seasonally drifts in from 
the near west; the fierce crimson of the proud bushes is painted against the 
horizon like a spidery, intense ink stain on blotting paper.  To the east, 
beyond a two-foot drop down along a shore sculpted by the occasional anger 
of water, stretches the magnificent Hogwarts Lake.  The clear sweetness of 
the air is permeated by the freshness of the ground beneath; fresh grass and 
seasonal, enchantingly-white flowers grow like soft, tear-shaped pearls on a 
velvet-smooth dress.  Bordering the three willows that dip their long, 
swaying hair into the water are a few thickets, rumbling like spinsters and 
looking like short, annoyed chaperones of three, fair maidens.  The shore 
follows the lake northeast; to the north, south, southwest, and northwest 
explode endless, beautiful grounds.  By contrast, a pale, unwelcoming sight 
of a solitary, moaning tree darkens the western landscape.

thanks!  `-mira 
 
ECHOES:
 
1) Lovely echo number 0. Awesome!
 
2) Please change &quot;fertilizer&quot; to &quot;fertiliser&quot; in wonderful, British spelling. Also, please change &quot;flower beds&quot; to &quot;flowerbeds&quot;.
 
3) Please add a comma between &quot;light&quot; and &quot;flowery&quot; here.
 
4) Please change echo number 3 to: &quot;The wheel-of-fortune device squeaks and rocks slightly in a bluster of wind.&quot;
 
EDS:
 
I've edited your ed; please take a peek when you get a moment. I was a bit confused about the creatures you had there, so I interpreted your ed in the way I thought made sense. Please correct me if I am wrong. I would also expect the readers to want to know more about the said creatures, so please consider either adding more info or making some eds about them. `-Cristina

      <desc>A wheel with six spokes stands in the middle of this patch, between two 
striped poles; a crank prolongs the hub.  On top of the wheel lords a 
crowned, sword-wielding sphinx.  On one of its sides stands a strange 
creature, with its head up and its hindquarters down; it wears a collar that 
binds its long ears to the neck.  On the other side, an upside-down, 
ape-like thing looks quite crestfallen.  Against the underside of the wheel, 
two furrowed lines connect the sides of the round device, forming a convex 
rectangle no wider than a tarot card.  Inside the figure is a carved letter 
&quot;X&quot;.

    <desc>. Here lies a beautifully-woven path of lilies popping out of the ground and 
spreading out everywhere.  They come in all different shades and colours; 
the most common are white, purple, blue, and a very pretty pink.  Their 
oblong petals are turned upwards searching for any sunlight, while their 
roots look for water and nutrients underneath the deep-green grass.  There 
are a few shrubs sticking out of the ground here and there to keep the 
flowers from being over-heated, but they are clearly not needed because out 
of the ground, a beautiful tree hopefully stretches up towards the sky.  The 
lush, green leaves are turned upwards on the branches, as if to pull the any 
sunlight into a tight embrace.  The tree is covered with a dark dress of 
bark.  Off to the north, northeast and northwest, mother nature continuing 
her path of lilies.  Off to the east, south, southeast and southwest, mother 
nature is quickly growing more beautiful flowerbeds and lilies.

    <desc>. Beautiful flowers are scattered about the ground.  They come in many 
bright, vibrant colours, like pink, orange, and yellow, and many dark ones 
too, like purple and navy.  Their roots are sunk very deep into the ground 
to soak up any nutrients that come their way, but their leaves are pointed 
up into the sky determined to absorb any hint of sunlight no matter how 
bright of fadded it may be.  The ground is litered with mulitcolored 
blossoms, running off in every direction.

    <desc>Flowers are running throughout the area. They come in bright shades and dark ones too. Their leaves and petals curl up, ready for any sign of sunlight to hit them and be immediately sucked up throughout their leaves and petals. They are stuck deep into the ground, going down about five or six inches. The lush, green grass huddles around their stems, eager to get any dew that might just fall off the flowers leaves. The flowers petals are oblong and most are multicoloured. Most are grouped together but some are separated from the group. They run off in every direction.
</desc>
    <editeds>The echo is all good and ready to go!  ;) 
</editeds>
    <editfirst>Many resplendent and motley-coloured flowers are jumbled together in no 
particular arrangement.  They stand proudly and few are wilted, weathered, 
or worn.  The flowers' roots are dug in deep and their petals are spread 
wide.  The ground is deep and fertile, full of good nutrients to feed the 
plants that reside here.  The stems on the flowers are a deep, dark green.  
The leaves are the same colour as the stem.  In contrast to the uniform 
leaves, the petals; some are as round and layered as a pom-pom, others as 
flat as an ironing board.  Some are large and others small.  The petals 
stick out in a ostentatious manner, and are very colourful and bright.  The 
Hogwarts grounds continue in every direction, the very lovely rose garden 
being to the north.

    <editfirstcomments>Hello!
 
The general feeling was good, but I did a big reorganisation in the order of the sentences: now, you start from a general view of the plant, then go up from roots to blossoms.
 
I've also changed a few words to avoid repetitions of the same word (e.g; given).
 
Finally, a comma is necessary before &quot;but&quot; (and all related words, like &quot;albeit&quot;.
 
I know it may sound like I've done a lot to the roos, but really, it was minor changes (who has never forgotten a comma?) and mostly reorganisation so that your writing may appear more fluid and get through more efficiently.
 
Please keep up the good work!

    <desc>Far south of here stands the outer wall of the Hogwarts Ground; the faraway 
castle is faintly outlined against the northern horizon.  The bushy and 
coloured silhouette of some flower beds is visible against the eastern 
vista, whereas the tall, sandstone wall of the Quidditch Pitch bars the 
western edge of this patch of grass.  Against the expanse of the said wall, 
right in the middle of it, and on a socle, writhe the petrified coils of two 
statues, representing snake-like creatures.  The grass at their feet is a 
dark-green with just a dash of blue mixed in.  Little daisies draw 
concentric circles around the statues, looking like immobile foam ridges on 
a calm, deep sea; the thin lines are only crossed by five pathsradiating 
from the double statue to the north, north-east, east, south-east, and 
south.

      <desc>The socle is a simple, low cylinder either made of or coated in silver.  
Around where the two snake-like statues rear from the pedestal, concentric 
waves are sculpted on its surface, mimicking water ripples.  Among those 
natural-looking undulations, a small mark lies practically unnoticed: two 
crescents are drawn back to back, with a horizontal line crossing and 
linking them both.  Below this sign are scratched the words &quot;Pisces, the 
Fishes&quot;.

      <desc>A closer look at the daisies reveals them to be life-like imitations of the 
living flowers.  The dark, bronze stem is thin and fragile enough to sway 
even in the slightest gust of wind.  It proudly supports a corolla of nacre 
petals, held together into a delicate, tiny, and silver framework.  In the 
centre, instead of a soft, velvety, and yellow dome is an oval-cut, golden 
beryl.

      <desc>The blades of grass are wide and tall, and they grow in thick, touching 
tufts, leaving no soil visible.  Thus they create a thick carpet to tread 
on, muffling most stepping sounds.  Apart from that, the lawn presents an 
unusual colouring, both because of its darkness and because of its bluish 
tinge; this hue is a very dark-teal, the colour of the sea under a leaden 
sky.

      <desc>The two sea serpent creatures are touching where they come out of their 
pedestal.  However, one stands nearly upright, whereas the other one extends 
almost northwards, somewhat parallel to the ground and to the nearby 
Quidditch Pitch wall.  The muscular, snake-like columns of their bodies are 
covered in tiny, silver scales and outlined by a webbed crest of bones.  
They also measure at least one foot in width and ten feet in length - for 
the part above the socle.  Their heads look more like those of horses, with 
a long head and dark, slightly-bulging eyes.  However, the ears normally 
found on a horse are each replaced with three, thin, webbed bones; a similar 
adornment hangs from the underside of the mouth, resembling a beard.  Their 
mane consist not of hair, but of seaweed.

    <desc>Shadowed by the eastern wall of the Quidditch Pitch is a patch of soft, 
black earth covered in tender, golden-green grass.  Almost right in its 
centre is a small, shallow pond; in the pond stands the statue of a magical 
creature pouring water in the pond.  To the east lay the flower beds, to the 
south looms the distant outer wall, and to the north the silhouette castle 
is faintly visible.

    <desc>Depending on the season, the bushes and trees in this patch display leaves 
of different hues, flowers from white to pink to crimson, and grey to golden 
fruits.  The succulent fruit are called quinces and give their name to their 
bearers.  Because they are edible, house-elves are often seen in this area.  
In winter, however, all ornaments disappear and uncover the twiggy nature of 
the plants underneath.  It's also the time of the year when the eight, 
pebble paths to every direction are the best seen against the black, rich 
soil.  The Quidditch Pitch, some distance to the east, provides shade and 
slightly blocks out the view of further flower-beds and of the distant, 
north-eastern castle.  Close by, the Outer Wall nestles this spot from the 
northeast to the south.

    <editdraftcomments>Wow! This room here is an absolute beauty. It's got a springy pace, a lovely amount of detail, and almost nothing to edit. Please do take a look at what I did change, however, and let me know if I was wrong about anything. Hugs, Cristina

    <editfirstcomments>Hi!  I'm just signaling that I changes a tiny thing in the ed, which was 
already faulty in my version.  &quot;The last breed of plants in this spot *is* 
Japanese Quinces&quot; sounds strange, so I changed it to &quot;The last breed of 
plants in this spot *consists* of Japanese Quinces&quot;.

      <desc>While all small trees here display dark-green leaves in mid-spring, some of 
the plants, the Chinese Quinces, shift in autumn to a brick-red, beautiful 
tint.  This eastern species produces, at about the same time, pale-pink 
flowers.  The European Quinces bloom the same colour, but as early as 
February; these inflorescences are a morale-raising sight in an otherwise 
often-dreary month.  The last breed of plants in this spot consists of 
Japanese Quinces, which bloom around mid-spring in hues ranging from a 
delicate white to a brilliant crimson.  During summer, all of the trees here 
produce fruit, which are bleak-grey and hairy at first, but soon turn 
golden, pear-shaped, and divinely-smelling.

a cloud of fragrant, lavender mist that hangs low against the ground.  The 
blooms are speckled, like a kind of tropical lily, and their petals are 
slightly green at the base.  Perfumed droplets from the mist streak the 
silky surface of the blossoms and nestle into the soft grass.  East of this 
misty patch is a statue of an archer, while the statue of the caged chimaera 
stands to the northeast.  A young tree and a clover patch lie respectively 
south and southwest.  A sandstone wall blocks the way to the Quidditch

    <editdraftcomments>Hello again :) first off, you say 'large' a lot in the beginning, so I took 
2 of them out to make it less redundant.  And the perfumed droplets you 
have, is that from like rain, or the scented mist that the flowers give out? 
 You may want to clarify.  If it's from rain, I'm not sure how that would 
work, I'd need to ask somebody, hehe.  And last, your sentence about the 
haze I've removed to be put in as an echo which I'll place in the eds field. 
 :) 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1. Please change echo number 0 to: 'The lavender haze just brushes the tips of the grass blades, swirling in twisting, moist vapour.'
 
2. Please change echo number 1 to: 'A warm tendril of the swirling mist reaches out and dissipates in the air.'

of fragrant lavender mist that hangs low to the ground.  They are speckled, 
like (a) kind of tropical lily, and their petals are slightly green at the 
base.  Perfumed droplets streak the silky surface of the blossoms, and 
nestle into the soft grass.  East of the mist is a statue of Sagittarius the 
Archer, (while) a statue of Capricorn stands to the northeast.  A young tree 
and a clover patch lie to the south and southwest, respectively.  A barrier 
blocks the way to the Quidditch pitch, which can be spotted to the north and

</editsecond>
    <editsecondcomments>I've just tweaked things here and there. There were no major changes, except for the mentioning of the archer statue and the capricorn, which I've changed to more visual mentions, since what the players see is an archer and a caged chimaera, though they might have no idea of what these are. I've also suggested 'After a rain' between brackets; unless the droplets come from the mist - in which case please specifically mention this - please remove the brackets. Please also tell me in your note which version you've accepted. For the rest, golden room! Huggles, Cristina

    <desc>Casting an overpowering shadow upon the entire area, a substantial, 
unassailable, beige wall penetrates the ground to the east.  Cracked and 
crumbling, with a weather-beaten surface, the Quidditch Pitch wall stands 
for the protection of passers-by as well as the spectators.  A large, 
magical engraving is etched within the wall, showing current Quidditch 
highlights.  Adding an odd stench to the area, a marshy patch bubbles and 
burps grotesquely to the west, taking away from the ambient of the vicinity. 
 Seemingly, out of place, a small, yet proud and magnificent Justice statue 
rests to the northwest, draped in ivy.  Adding a sweet alternative to the 
sour marsh, a crabapple tree survives to the southwest despite the onslaught 
of tar-filled pools to the west.  To the north and south, the grounds follow 
a parallel line to the Quidditch Pitch.

while the northwestern, western, and southwestern vistas are similarly 
barred by an outer wall.  Large, tar-filled, black pools disfigure the soil,

occasionally giving way to bursting, acid-green, tall flames.  The smoke

allow passage out of the area in every direction.  Meagre clumps of reeds 
hunch despondently down, bearing the marks of vice-like, desperate grasping; 
it looks as if people have used them to break their slipping fall.

    <editeds>Aww, I love your echoes here :) but in #0, I think it should be 'moving

    <editsecondcomments>Dear Carole, all that I changed here is mostly related to making the room more explosive and atmospheric. Please try to remove words such as: First, Second, etc, as they sound more like a report than like a room. One question - you have the Hinkypunk &quot;swinging its lights&quot;, while in the echo you have it swinging a single light. I don't have Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, so if those two should be the same thing, please make it so. I would like to congratulate you, as ever, on the fantastic content you have here, and add that the only things you're missing to reach absolute coolness and perfection are a few fine-tunes of style. `-Cristina

    <editdraftcomments>Hey Scott.  This is another magnificent room to your collection.  I 
absolutely loved the snow-angel reference!  Sentence 1) Please add a comma 
after &quot;beautiful&quot; to separate the adjectives.  Also, everything has to be 
static - unmoving.  There can't be a breeze there all the time unless it is 
a magical one.  If so, just add &quot;magical&quot;, &quot;enchanted&quot;, &quot;supernatural&quot; etc.  
Sentence 3: Add a comma after &quot;sits&quot;.  Sentence 4: Please add a comma 
between &quot;puffy white&quot; to separate the adjectives.  Sentence 5: Please add a 
comma after &quot;south&quot;.  And yes, Comma-Nazi though I may be, they seem to be 
your only mistake.  Excellent, job!  I look forward to more of them!  Xoxo

    <editfirst>Caressing every inch of the beautiful, open area, an enchanted breeze flows 
through the grounds giving life to the areas all around.  In summer time, 
the grass of lush green grows strong and refuses any weeds to inhabit this 
area, seemingly assisted by some form of magic.  Adding character to the 
grounds, a small wooden bench sits awaiting weary students needing a rest.  
A fresh layer of puffy, white snow cake the Hogwarts grounds in wintertime; 
surely, a snow angel or two resides here.  A small clover patch lies to the 
south, possibly bearing the renowned four-leaf clover to the seeker.  The 
well-marked path of the Hogwarts grounds continues to the east and west.

      <desc>Small and worn from many years of use, this bench sits firmly implanted in 
the ground.  A green aura of magic floats around the legs giving the bench 
strength and protection from the endless use and battering of the seasons.  
The bottom side of the bench bears a decade's worth of Droobles Best Blowing

    <desc>Wide and open, the Hogwarts grounds seem to extend into eternity.  Centred 
in the area is a large and majestic tree marked with age and many stories 
embedded in the bark.  The immense tree covers most of the area from any 
attempt of the sun peeking through to the ground.  Unlike the rest of the 
grounds, small granite stones cover the earth masking the lack of grass or 
growth of any form.  The large tree nearly masks the existence of a small, 
covered well.  Just beyond the well to the south, the Strength Statue gleams 
proudly.

    <editdraftcomments>Hey Scott.  Excellent work!  Sentence one: Add a comma after &quot;open&quot;.  
Sentence 2: &quot;centered&quot; is spelled &quot;centred&quot;, as we are using the British 
terms and spellings.  Sentence 4: You use the word &quot;grounds&quot; twice here.  
Change the second one to &quot;earth&quot;, &quot;land&quot;, &quot;soil&quot;, etc.  Sentence 5: Please 
add a comma after &quot;small&quot; to separate the adjectives.  Otherwise, a perfect 
room!  Excellent job!  As always, send a note if you disagree with anything.

    <editeds>Outstanding EDs.  Just 2, small things.  ED2, Sentence 1: add a comma after 
&quot;whomping willow&quot; and a comma after &quot;proudly&quot;.  Sentence 2: add a comma 
after &quot;appear&quot;.  Otherwise, great ideas!  Very imaginative.

    <desc>. Here is a beautiful pattern of shrubs and flowers, they are scattered about 
in no particular pattern.  They occasionally droop here and there.  The 
shrubs shade many of the flowers, keeping them from getting overheated.  A 
sweet smell of the flowers lingers in the air, coming faintly, then stronger 
as it drifts around in the air.  The shrubs and flowers branch off in every 
direction.  Their velvety petals are turned upwards greedily to soak up any 
sunlight that reaches them.

    <desc>Shrubs and Flowers are scattered around this area lazily, but still ready to 
soak up any sunlight that heads towards them.  The flowers have are mostly 
bright, vibrant, colours, but occasionaly there is a deep blue or dark 
purple flower poking up out of the ground.  Several shrubs with forest-green 
leaves are strewn around protecting some of the flowers from getting to hot. 
 The flowers have mostly long stems and oblong petals, but there are a few 
with round petals, like daiseys and pansy's.  They are scattered in every 
direction.

flowerbeds.  Even closer, to the west, the protecting rampart of the

    <editsecondcomments>Cris, I realized my mentioning glass wool wasn't very clear, so I've tweaked 
the statue ed in this one e bit, and changed the glass wool to steel wool 
(makes more sense since the statue is made out of metal).  Just in case, 
more explanations on steel wool can be found here: http://en.  Wikipedia.  
Org/wiki/Steel_wool .  Please have a last look at this ed.  Everything else 
I edited according to your wondrous suggestions.  See you!

      <desc>The statue is made out of silver.  The beast's head resembles a ram's, with 
very-short hair, small, rounded eyes, and spiral horns.  However, the horns 
are sharp and the teeth occasionally seen as the beast snarls are equally 
pointy and dangerous-looking.  The general silhouette of the animal is that 
of a ram, though leaner and more muscled; also, the wool doesn't look soft 
and fluffy, but rough and irritant like steel wool.  On the left horn is 
carved a sign, a vertical line that splits at the top to curl into to 
spirals.  The right horn bears the neatly engraved inscription &quot;Aries, the 
Ram&quot;; below is a hastily and shallowly scribbled, &quot;This is a Bicorn, not a 
ram, dude!&quot;

      <desc>The tall grass thickly covers the ground in a succulent, luxuriant 
dark-green, making it difficult to walk here.  Luckily, paths offer flatter, 
more welcoming ground to walk upon.  The white, chalk pebbles in these 
friendlier lanes contrast sharply, though beautifully, with it.  The blades 
seem to know that, as they languidly round the paths' edges, in an attempt 
to tickle the angular, tiny stones.  Together with the not-so-distant, 
sandstone wall of the Quidditch Pitch, the trails and lawn offer a pastoral, 
quite picturesque view.

      <desc>The sculpted dragon is, in fact, a hundred-headed snake.  On each stone 
head, a black horn prolongs a pair of superciliary arches, and each maw is 
red, speckled with yellowing teeth.  The underside of each neck is a 
muddy-yellow, whereas the rest of the head is poisonous-green; this colour 
scheme is continued on the muddy-yellow underbelly and the poisonous-green 
body.  Where the hundred, stone heads meet with the body, a golden ring 
embraces the creature; on it is written, &quot;Ladon, the never-sleeping guardian 
of the Hesperides Garden&quot;.  The twenty-foot-long body loosely coils around 
the tree.

      <desc>The grass is the same tender-green hue as the tree's leaves; winter, 
however, leaves the tree unchanged, though it covers the entire vista around 
it.  The earth visible under the blades or in the paths is rich, black, and 
soft, and the tree's roots dig deeply into it.  Some calcareous, angular 
pebbles dapple this soil.

    <editdraftcomments>Nice desc, carole!  Just took out a few words, changed a few commas.  
Nothing major as usual.  I love how you write all of these rooms in the 
center of this huge area, where there's 8 possible exits, hehe.  I gotta 
remember these spots next time I play hide-and-seek on here.  It'd be 
easiest to run from!  ;) 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Your echoes are fantabulous, :) I've edited all 4 of your eds, so please 
peek at them.  Gentle reminder: it's grey here on the MUD, not gray, as 
that's american.  Best way I remember at least, is A for American, so no A.  
:) other than that, just tiny spelling things and grammar.  I love your 
creativity and style, carole!  Keep your awesome rooms coming!  `-mira 
 
The echoes are superb, as Mira says, and I've edited all your eds, though no more than a few tweaks were necessary. Keep these lovely rooms coming, sweet Carole! `-Cristina

    <editfirstcomments>I see you took out the outer wall part.  In that case, the south direction 
should also be erased: the outer wall is to the south, while the castle is 
to the north.  That's what I mean as &quot;respectively of the Hogwarts Castle 
and of the outer wall&quot;.  I probably didn't use the right expression, but if 
you could point it to me, that'd be wondrous.

    <editsecondcomments>My dear Carole, I've tried to rephrase your draft according to your comments; please tell me if I've got the text right this time. I think what I loved most about this room was your statue of the snake. Brilliant work! `-Cristina

      <desc>The statue's pedestal is rather simple and plain; a short, grey, stone 
cylinder forms its base, framed by two slightly-larger, round-edged 
platters.  On the pedestal's north side is written, &quot;Ophiuchus, the 
thirteenth, little-known constellation and its Serpent.&quot;

      <desc>Whether this statue is slightly larger-than-life, or the man depicted is 
really that tall and wide, may never be answered.  What is certain though, 
is that the man is a colossus relative to his surroundings.  His crude, 
angular, beardless face is framed by a wavy, sculpted, unruly mane, and his 
frozen, still eyes fiercely gaze northward.  His wide shoulders extend into 
powerful, buff arms which he uses to hold a giant snake.  Cloth cuffs adorn 
his wrists.  The muscular torso and toned abdomen are covered with a silver 
chain-mail, while some metal plates form a stiff skirt which protects his 
hips and upper legs.  His tibias are shielded behind greaves and he wears 
sandals on his stone feet.

      <desc>A huge, sculpted snake is held firmly and almost horizontally by a firm, 
stone hand; the stone man whom the hand belongs to maintains the creature at 
waist height.  The tail of the serpent extends to the west, while the head 
rears to the east.  The whole body is covered in tiny, silvery-green scales, 
except for the underside, which is overlaid with pure-silver, wide scales.  
The head adheres to the same colour scheme, with the addition of silver 
teeth, horns, and green, slit-like eyes.

    <desc>Calm waters brush against the granite base of the steady wall, while frogs 
and insects roam freely upon the small patch of grass by the Lake side.  A 
park stretches to the north of the stone barrier, decorated with wild, 
dark-green bushes.  Rising amidst the mass of freshness are the grey form of 
Hogwarts Castle and the beige Quidditch Pitch, and, far in the distance, the 
Forbidden Forest.  Rows of willows and rounded stones line a small path 
leading towards the water.  Their sweet, thick scent fills the air, mixed 
with a powerful, fierce freshness coming from the brilliantly-green 
surroundings.  The wall turns a rounded corner, towards the east and the 
northwest, its surface tightly embraced by silvery vines of ivy.

wall.  The smoothened edges of the barrier are barely visible beneath 
complicated webs of thick vines, covered with oval leaves.  Sharp needles 
stick out of the silver-coloured plant, making it look like a dangerous 
porcupine with the grace of a snake.

corncockle, a red-purplish flower.  They all have very beautiful petals, 
some oblong, some round or square shaped.  Their oblong or grass-like leaves 
are stretched towards the skies, occasionally curling back down.  They

    <editfirstcomments>Hello!
 
I'm suggesting a few tweaks, mainly reorganization. I also took out the mention of the corncockle's colour. It didn't run smoothly in the sentence; but please, feel free (and even encouraged ;) to make an ed and develop these flowers (less known than daisies or lilies). 
 
I'd also like to see more information on the scent (which can also make it into an ed), but that's obviously not mandatory.

    <editdraft>Tall oak trees stand to the edges of this patch of land.  Pretty rose bushes 
stand west of this land.  It seems like the flowers have been blessed with 
the entire beauty in the world.  To the east lie lily flowers, they carry an 
enchanting smile, their eyes twinkling with mischief.  In the middle of this 
land is a small, rackety, old wooden bench polished with turpentine.  When 
it is vacated of humans, tiny birds perch upon it.  When these tiny birds 
sit down to sing melodious tunes, it sounds like an orchestra of enchanting 
music; a sudden quietness befalls the place as everyone listens to them 
sing.  Highly elastic grounds stretch north, east, south, west, southeast, 
southwest, and northwest.  A pretty, awesome flowerbed spreads its beauty 
northeast.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Lovely room.  The birds should be in an echo, as their perching and singing 
are events.  There is a great deal of repetition in this desc, so I've given 
you sample alternatives.  This location is midway between Hogwarts to the 
east and the Quidditch Pitch to the west, with the rose gardens in the 
south.  It would be nice to mention these landmarks, to help players figure 
out where they are, if you'd like to add a sentence or two to that effect.  
I've removed the words 'Highly elastic', because they imply that the grounds 
change size and shape regularly.  That would be a very cool magical effect, 
but I'm not sure the engine will handle it.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Please rephrase your echo to: 'A small girl with blonde hair and cat-green eyes dreamily settles down under one of the trees and starts playing a melodious tune on a beautiful flute.'
 
COMMENTS:
 
The reason I changed 'almond green' to 'cat-green' was that almonds are not really green. You can have almond-shaped, green eyes, if you like, but not almond-green eyes.

    <editsecond>A deep-green patch of grass covers the ground here.  The short blades are so 
brightly coloured that it seems like a flock of parrots have occupied the 
ground, the grass their olive feathers and the scattered red weeds, their 
beaks.  Like royal velvet, the soft plants cover the rough ground.  
Surrounded by tall trees on all sides, this place has an enchanting look.  
Any light strong enough to pierce the foliage also provides warmth here.  
Benches perch on a rotating platform; it is shaped like a flat, round disc, 
with designs at the corners.  As it turns, each bench spins around itself.  
Perfect specimens of beautiful flowerbeds lie north and northeast.  Vast 
grounds open out in all other directions.  
</editsecond>
    <editsecondcomments>I loved the comparison with the parrots, it's awesome.
 
Sentence five: it will not always be sunny here; there will not always be light (what about after nightfall?), so I've tried to remould this lovely sentence, as shown between brackets. You can choose to rephrase this otherwise, too, if you'd like, only tell me if you do decide on something else.
 
Sentence eight: I've removed this sentence entirely, since it did not seem appropriate - you can't know this from just walking in here. I'm sorry, love, we'll leave that to RP-ing students and teachers.
 
Sentence nine: Clear days mean no clouds, so I've removed your sentence, however lovely it is.

    <desc>Here lies a nature scene; it consists of having foxglove, daffodiles, ivy 
and honeysuckel all mixing together. They flowers are very nice and healthy, 
and none seem to be wilted. The foxglove has bright yellow petals, like the 
daffodiles only lighter in colour. The honeysuckle, is another bright 
flower, only it happens to be white instead of yellow, with oblong petals. 
All of the petals on every flower looks very delicate, as if it would break 
or be crushed on contact with anything but the other flowers. The grass 
around them is like-wise very healthy, with a lush-green colour to it. The 
flowers expand in every direction.

    <editeds>This one's fine and dandy!  :D

    <editfirst>Here lies a pastoral scene of having a foxglove, daffodils, an ivy and a 
honeysuckle all mixing together; the flowers expand in every direction and 
into nearby patches.  The flowers are very nice and healthy, and none shows 
any sign of wilting.  The lush green of the grass around them likewise 
bespeaks health.  The foxglove is bright-yellow, like the daffodils, albeit 
of a lighter in colour.  The honeysuckle is another bright blossom, only it 
is white instead of golden, with oblong petals.  Every and each petal on 
every single flower looks very delicate, as if anything but their fellow 
plants would break or crush them on contact.

    <editfirstcomments>Hello!
 
This room has a nice imagery, but gosh, was it muddled and full of typos! Please be sure to use Word to type and spell-check your text before pasting them in a room and sending a note to mythos.
 
I'd love, on the other hand, to see some ed(s) of these flowers. ;) Oh, and I have a couple questions: are there ony one daffodil and one honeysuckle in this patch? Was is the ivy clinging to? or it is running rampant?
 
See you. ;D

    <desc>Pearl-white lilies rule over this damp, fertile piece of land.  The plants 
are spaced quite near and they lean over one another as though hugging 
tightly.  The flowers move their pretty faces gracefully as light winds 
touch their soul.  Their petals have a shimmer, like gold; they have the 
capacity to provide beauty and fragrance for ages to come.  An envelope of 
dust covers the blooms like silver glitter.  They don't prefer shady corners 
and try to lean towards any possible light when they are covered in dark.  
To provide nutrients for its healthy growth, adequate amounts of mulch is 
added to the soil.  A tall and sturdy banyan tree stands north, with a swing 
hung on its thick branches.  Students like to sit on the swing, admiring the 
flowers and chatting with friends.  The magic of the royal family of flowers 
continues far and wide north, east, and northwest; sky is the limit for the 
grounds that stretch south, west, southeast, and southwest.

    <desc>Many flowers are arranged on the soft, green grass in no particular pattern.  
They have long, oblong petals and many different types of leaves.  
Some of the flowers are a couple of inches larger then others.  They come in 
soft or intense colours that almost seem to glow on a summers day.  They 
have turned their leaves and petals upwards to absorb any ray of sunlight 
that may come near them, no matter how small it may be.  Their roots are 
sunk deep down into the ground so that they can suck up all the nutrients 
possible.  The grass around them is a very deep green, that is just a 
little bit lighter in colour then the stems.  The flowers run along the 
ground in every direction.  
</desc>
    <editeds>The echo is good grammatically: however, where does that flapping sound 
comes from?  Please mention some explanation either in the desc or in a ed.

    <editfirst>Many flowering plants run on the soft, green grass in an irregular pattern 
and in every direction.  They have long, oblong petals, whose intense 
colours almost seem to glow on summer days, and many different types of 
leaves.  Both leaves and flowers are turned upwards to absorb any wandering 
ray of sunlight, no matter how small.  The roots sink deep down into the 
ground so as to suck up any available nutrients.  Some of the blossoms are a 
couple of inches larger then others.  The grass around them is a very-deep 
green, albeit just a little bit lighter in colour then the flowers' stems.  
</editfirst>
    <editfirstcomments>hello!
 
I have rearranged the sentences' order as well as suggested a few tweaks.
 
I would like for you to explain the &quot;couple-of-inches larger flowers&quot;, preferably in a ed. You can really mention something that is out of the ordinary without explaining why they are extraordinary. Otherwise, the palyer may feel frustrated! ;)
See you. :p

    <desc>Many flowers are scattered in this particular area.  Some of them are 
be aglow and burning with bright colours like orange and yellow, while 
others are crepuscular and atramentous colours like crimson.  The 
ground is brown and muggy, but also very nutritious and deep.  The plants are 
standing perfectly erect and proud; only their leaves drop a little towards 
the ground.  Their petals ascend towards the sky so that they can devour any 
soupcon of sunlight that comes their way.  The Hogwarts Grounds go out in every which way.  
</desc>
    <editeds>Please take away the addecho in echo [1]. Also be mindful of time of occurrence for your echo: From 7am to 5 am include quite a lot of night-time they may not be any shadow.
 
For that matter, there may be days with very little shadow, 'cause the sky's overcast. Please explain better your shadows here (e.g. a sudden ray of sunlight cast the shadow of a bird on the ground).
 
One th other hand, with the new, coming system of seasonal echo, the problem may be resolved, but keep in mind you'll have to swing by this room when the new system is implemented...

    <editfirst>A brown and muddy, albeit very nutritious and deep ground sustain 
perfectly-erect and proud plants.  While the leaves drop a little towards 
the ground, the petals ascend towards the sky and devour any soupcon of 
sunlight that comes their way.  Some of the blossoms are aglow and burning 
with bright, crepuscular hues of crimson, orange, and yellow, while other, 
atramentous ones remind of the night blending in with the dusk.  Many 
different flowers scatter away in every direction.  
</editfirst>
    <editfirstcomments>Okay, it's very muddled here. While I'm pretty happy to have learned ?atramentous?, it applies to something black or blackish, not crimson. Now, on the other hand I absolutely love the crepuscular idea. I even think it could really be expanded into something lovely. Like a room with a room with crepuscular theme of flaming crimsom, one with a dawn, lilac theme, one with a noon, golden theme, and one with a night theme, atramentous flowers, and silvers buds.
 
Since I don't think there's any unclaimed room left, you'd have to rewrite some of your rooms to make space for this. As it is I think this is also a good opportunity to revisit these rooms. Most of them looks a lot alike, maybe too much alike: the stems are always very upright, the leaves slightly curving, the petals and leaves soaking every tiny fleck of sun... i've suggested on occasions that you expand a bit, notably of flowers which sounded interested.
 
If that's any consolation, I've been in this position before, of having to completely rewrite a room from scratch, And I've always find that the results were far superior to the initial drafts. However, this is your call; so if you just want to keep things here as they are, there's my edit of your draft. I would also ask that you write an ed of the dark flowers please.

    <desc>.  Many resplendent and motley-coloured flowers are jumbled together in no particular arrangement. They stand proudly and few are wilted, weathered, or worn. The flowers' roots are dug in deep and their petals are spread wide. The ground is deep and fertile, full of good nutrients to feed the plants that reside here. The stems on the flowers are a deep, dark green. The leaves are the same colour as the stem. In contrast to the uniform leaves, the petals; some are as round and layered as a pom-pom, others as flat as an ironing board. Some are large and others small. The petals stick out in a ostentatious manner, and are very colourful and bright. The Hogwarts grounds continue in every direction, the very lovely rose garden being to the north. 
</desc>
    <editeds>Beware the time: I think you meant 7 am to 5 PM ! Remember, for the echo we use a 24-hour clock, with 0 being midnight and 23 being 11 pm.
 
Be careful too of the amount of sunlight: these descs will be subitted to seasonal change. So, unless you state otherwise because of some magic, it won't always be sunny enough in this atch to warrant a shadow.
On the up side, I like this image of a &quot;shadow bird&quot;.

    <desc>Many orchid, lavender, and foxglove flowers stand here soaking up nutrients. 
With the exception of the foxglove, their petals are turned up facing the 
sky, hoping for the slightest hint of sunlight, with their roots stuck down 
deep into the ground. The foxglove's petals, on the other hand, form 
downward-facing bells; they all cluster on one side of the stem, leaving the 
other bare. All the flowers have similar large leaves and dark-green stems. 
The grass is a nice spring green and very fertile. The Hogwarts grounds

    <editfirstcomments>Hello
 
This one's mostly golden, I've just: 
- changed &quot;in the north&quot; to &quot;to the north&quot; in the last sentence,
- Changed ?north? into ?southwest and southeast?,
- and introduced some synonyms for &quot;flowers&quot; so as to avoid repetitions.

    <desc>A coarse, sandy path, no wider than five feet, opens into the rolling plain 
of the Hogwarts Grounds.  The majestic willows on either side of the road 
dwindle away to shrubs and bushes, exposing the last few inches of the 
sand-covered lane to any inquiring eye.  Grass blades bite into the large, 
beige and grey granules, daringly spreading at the edge of the small road.  
The heavy boughs of the golden-green willows caress the rough surface of the 
sand below in their languorous, but passionate swaying motion.  To the 
south, the lush, green surroundings pale before the seasonal, intense 
crimson of a rose garden releasing heavy, sweet perfume deeply in the air.  
A southwestern alley runs between the blood-like blossoms with their dark 
leaves.  To the east, the sand road sinks deeper beneath the gentle 
tenderness of willows, bushes, and shrubs; everywhere else stretch fresh 
grounds.

      <desc>Crimson, soft-pink, and white roses stand tall in the southern garden, entwined around each other; their colours powerfully contrast with the dark-green of their leaves. From beneath a fortress of sharp thorns, the flowers are enticing and beautiful, opening in whirlpools of swirling, magical intensity. Their soft petals appear fragile and passionate at the same time, writhing and whispering with the slightest beat of the breeze. A heavy, sweet scent appears etched into their very stems and petals; the perfume lingers deeply in the air, clinging to every blade of grass and to every grain of sand.

    <desc>A path stretches here, heading east and west, its surface made of coarse 
sand and polished, rounded pebbles.  Old willows shade the lane from all 
sides, the slim ends of their long fingers tracing languorous lines through 
the pea-sized granules.  Their boughs, rich and flavour-filled, leave only 
the thinnest of streaks of heaven visible above; if there is any sunlight, 
the bright, burning, central stroke is accompanied by the vague, restless 
shapes of rays caught by willow branches.  Passage is nevertheless possible 
in all directions; the soft delicacy of a beautiful flowerbed stretches to 
the north and northeast, while to the southwest writhes the passionate, 
heavy-scented crimson of a rose garden.  Not far away, beyond the flowerbed, 
rises Hogwarts Castle, proudly piercing the sky with its turrets and towers. 
 Against the distant, western perspective, the beige stands of the Quidditch 
Pitch are crayonned.

    <desc>Rows of thick, old, graceful willows, their bark hidden beneath hungry 
shrubs and bushes, stand on both sides of this sand path.  The granules are 
coarse and large, as though having a protective shell hard as stone.  At 
ease and lazy, the small lane leads west, parallel to the castle, and bends 
in a smooth curve to the southeast.  Any light is filtered by the golden, 
gleaming boughs of the surrounding willows; even in the sunniest of days, 
the path remains shaded in a pleasant way, sun rays burning streaks only in 
the middle of the road and sideways, between the willows, where access is 
permitted in every direction.  To the northeast, north, and northwest runs a 
breathtaking flowerbed, blooming in all imaginable hues and shades during 
the warmer season.  Farther to the southwest, heavy, sweet scents mark the 
presence of a rose garden.

      <desc>The thick boughs of the willows bend towards the path, like the ponytails of pretty dancers tossing their heads in sweet abandon. Their hanging branches are soft and bendy, swaying and whispering all the time; the golden-green leaves caress the surface of the path below. Whatever is visible of the bark beyond the curtain of green locks and overprotective bushes shows that the trees are old and knobbly, their roots occasionally emerging from beneath a cover of earth.

    <desc>A circle of orange mushrooms cheerfully sprouts from the springy, green 
grass here, surrounding a patch of tiny, light blue flowers.  A few of the 
mushrooms are crushed, revealing dark-purple, mashed insides.  The flowers 
are small, but with long stems.  They reach towards the sky in a sort of 
plant fervour, and seem to laugh at the mushrooms, which hug the ground.  
Flower beds lie to the east, north, northeast, and northwest.  A path 
between willow-trees runs south and southeast, and curves up to the west.  A 
shadowy meadow spreads to the southwest.

    <editsecondcomments>Lovely, nearly perfect writing in this one, Petra, sweetness. I only tweaked things here and there, but not much. I've only changed two more significant things. The path between the willows, which is to the south, southwest, and west, is something I wrote, so I took the liberty of removing the 'two' from beside the 'willow-trees', since the path is basically traced by willows all the time, and they can also come in groups. I also changed a bit the part about the insides of the mushrooms, to emphasize that only because these mushrooms are crushed can the players see what's inside of them. If you think something's not right with my editing, don't hesitate to holler though. `-Cristina

    <desc>. Standing here in full bloom are alluring flowers in this garden.  Flowers 
in many different species grow here; the stand in neat rows, ranging in many 
different colours including red, orange, yellow, blue, and pink.  The 
flowers stand with their roots stuck deep in the ground stubbornly, none 
willing to move from there spots.  They branch out in every direction, and 
sway softly in the lightest of breezes.  They have a soft, wafty scent that 
drifts around the nose, though there are so many that they mix together, 
making it nearly impossible to pinpoint which flower is making which scent.  
The grass around them is a deep, lush green colour, and looks extremely 
healthy, the same colour as the leaves on the flowers.

    <editfirstcomments>Hello!
 
Please be careful with repetitions, for example of the verb to stand. You also use a lot &quot;to have&quot; and to be&quot; as auxiliary, adding gerontive elsewhere down the line/sentence. Try and blend in your more descriptive verbs with your grammatical subject.
 
Please also avoid obvious &quot;copy/paste&quot; from other of your rooms. Al your plants' roots dig deep in a nutritious soil, all of the flowers are many-coloured, all the leaves are the same colour as the grass... I know it's easy to fall into patterns of writing: at some point, all my roms had the &quot;dark/ominous/looming silhouette of the Hogwarts castle in the distance&quot;. However, some kind editor pointed  this flaw out to me and helped me become a better writer. So please try to edit these rooms with a bit more variety.

    <desc>When the season permits it, this area is full of greenery and wildflowers, 
randomly scattered atop the ground.  Standing centrally amongst them are 
two, stone benches that are facing each other, each shaped like a 
semi-circle.  Although they allow free passage between them, their closeness 
gives the illusion of a full circle.  Behind these benches grow various, 
man-planted flowers, their beautiful fragility giving away their tame 
nature.  Between the seats spreads a small circle of dirt, most likely 
pushed into its position by frequently-passing students.  The grounds 
continue to the west, while majestic flowerbeds lie north and northwest.  
Beyond a few, northeastern, stone bridges, Hogwarts Castle captivates the 
horizon, towering above the waterside that stretches east and south.  
Thickly hidden by ever-swaying willows, a path myriads to the southwest, the 
scent of the trees complemented by the sweet aroma of a southeastern lake.

    <editdraft>When the season permits it, this area is full of greenery and wildflowers 
randomly patterned throughout the ground.  Standing in the middle of this 
wondrous pattern is two stone benches that are each shaped in semi-circles.  
They are positioned just so that people can walk-in between them, yet they 
both form a visual circle.  Around the benches are an array of plants that 
must have been purposely planted around the back of both benches, since they 
dont seem to be wildflowers in nature.  In the middle of the benches is a 
small circle of dirt, most likely from students walking around there a lot.  
The grounds continue to the west, while a majestic flowerbed seems to lie 
just northwest of here.  Just northeast of here you can see Hogwarts Castle 
with a stone bridge lying just northeast, while to the southeast is the 
Lake.  
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>Mike, another great room!  :) just a side note, using is/are.  If your 
subject is singular, use is, if it's plural, use are.  And last, you wrote 
to the southeast lies a like school?  Made no sense to me.  If you type 
'exit' within a room, it shows you all the exits.  Se = the lake, so I added 
on an extra sentence at the end of yours to mention this.  If you don't like 
it, change it at your will :) 
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Echoes:
 
1. Please change your echo to 'A gentle breeze blows through, bringing with it a fresh, sweet scent.'
 
COMMENTS:
 
There is no 'scent of nature', since nature has a lot of smells. I gave an example in the formulation above. If you wish to rephrase your echo differently, please do so and give me a heads up (by note) if you have done so.
 
ED:
 
1. Please add 'stone' 'semi-circle' 'semicircle' 'semicircular' to the keywords of your ed. We are trying to have as many related keywords as we can. 
 
2. I have edited your ed, so please have a look when you get the chance.

    <editsecondcomments>This is a good room, Mike, with a good bit of imagery. However, this imagery would be even more splendid with a bit of tweaking, since you have some subject/predicate discordances and suchlike. The third sentence was very confusing, so I altered it a bit. I'll list a few more important points about this below:
 
1. Please, do not simply mention SOME of the exits, but ALL the exits, since this will be the readers' only guide to the next few rooms. If the adjacent rooms have not been written, try to imagine them from the titles, or simply state generalities, like 'The grounds majestically spread north.'
 
2. In the grammar department, you tent to have confusions like 'are an array of plants' or 'Standing here is two stone benches'. An 'array', like 'a variety' or 'a series' is singular. Therefore, you should have here 'is an array of plants'. Similarly, you have two benches, so you should say 'Standing here are two benches' or 'Two benches stand here'. 
 
3. Your sentence four is very confusing. Try not to think for the players, like 'an array of plants that must have been purposely planted around the back of both benches, since they don't seem to be wildflowers in nature'. Instead tell them WHY they don't appear to be wild flowers.
 
4. Also, please don't use a lot of 'seem'/'appear' structures. We try to tell the players what IS, not what SEEMS to be. Although it's perfectly okay to have a 'seems' in a desc, please try not to use it too many times. The room gains more vivacity this way, and none of the mystery of the room is lost, because the atmosphere is better maintained this way.
 
5. You used 'you' in the desc. Please do not use any second-person pronoun, like 'you' or 'your', in the desc or in the echoes. If you really want to use it, you may do so in the eds, but NEVER in the desc or echoes.

    <editsecondcomments>Lovely room, excellent, peaceful scenery you've got here, Carole, my sweet!
 
Your first sentence was a bit long and repetitive. I have changed some of it to make it a bit less so.
 
The second sentence has wind in it; I have suggested making this wind permanent; another solution would be to make this an echo.
 
Second sentence: flowers are only present here during the warmer seasons, since during winter, these flowers will be covered in snow. Unless magic keeps this place warm and unfrozen all year around, in which case, please tell us so, you need to specify which things are seasonal and which are not.
 
As a general comment: you tend to have fragments like 'The tall grass' or 'The final adornment'. Generally, however, if you haven't mentioned this element before, you would use the undecided article or no article at all: 'Tall grass', 'Some tall grass', 'A final adornment.'
comment second
 
ok, first toddling with the new system. About the sentence &quot;(Tall, luxuriant grass sways lightly, as though under a perpetual breeze,) little buttercups litter the path with merry splashes of colour, (...)&quot;. I've taken your suggestion about the echo, so I wrote in the desc &quot;little buttercups litter tall, luxuriant grass with merry splashes of colour, (...)&quot;; &quot;The tall, luxuriant grass sways lightly under a gust of breeze&quot; has become an echo. Hopes it is ok.

      <desc>This beast is a Re'em.  This statue depicts the animal peacefully grazing 
grass and dandelions, but carefully leaving out the buttercups, toxic to all 
cattle and cattle-like creatures.  The first sign that belies that quiet 
nature is the red, evil eyes.  In truth, like live Re'ems, this one is 
prepared to go from gentle to lethal the second it feels threatened.  At 
such times, his pure-gold corns can demonstrate their dangerous sharpness, 
while his thick, aureate hide can protect it from weapons and spells alike.  
Moreover, the beast's pure-gold hooves can carry it with speed and accuracy 
to its target.  As a last resort, its tail can lash away the intruder.  
Luckily, this statue is enchanted to have a very high tolerance to people: 
unless struck outright, it won't budge from its grazing.  This allows any 
curious person to see on its right horn a horned circle and, below that, 
&quot;Taurus&quot;.

in a very geometrical, very strict, and almost military fashion.  Their 
corners are perfectly right-angled, as are the seams between them; the

than joining them.  The pavement looks cared for, as neither dust, nor stain

      <desc>The blades of this grass are vivid green, but their rounded tips are made of 
pure gold that weighs them down.  The blades are slightly translucent due to 
their paper-thinness.  Nonetheless, they are very resistant and very 
reluctant to allow themselves to be pulled out.  If that is achieved, they 
ooze a measure of thick, clear juice; the fluid gives off an almost overly 
sweet scent and it tastes like cotton candy.  This makes the plant a 
favourite of penniless students.

    <editdraftcomments>Heya carole :) great room here.  I just did a few tweaks here and there, 
nothing major, just some grammar and addition of a few words.  Awesome 
writing though from you, as always.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Hey carole :) for your echoes, you have them running 24/7.  Animals are not 
awake all day, so you'll need to please change those times to something more 
fitting that particular animal.  And for echo #3, please make tail tails, as 
your subject (dogs) is plural.  I've also edited 5 of your 6 echoes, the 
only one I left alone was the hedgehog, the first one.  :) please use Word 
or something before entering in your text, as you have 3 of those ?  S 
situations, when it should be: 's.  Before entering it in on the MUD, check 
your screen and fix any mistakes like that if your program transfers the 
text over wrong.  I know that must be frustrating, hehe.  And just minor 
edits were done to your eds, nothing major.  :) thanks so much!  Keep up the 
great work.  `-mira 
 
Adding to Mira's comments:
 
ECHOES:
 
I see no reason why you couldn't keep the times of the echoes as it is. However, you should make it clear that these are the stone animals, and not live animals. I suggest the following:
 
1) Please change echo number [0] to: 'The sculpted dogs yelp joyfully and wag their tails for a second or two.'
 
2) Please change echo number [1] to: 'A snarl echoes from the direction of the statues; one of the stone hedgehogs curls up at once in a tight ball. Fear still lingers in its eyes as it slowly resumes its former position.'
 
3) Please change echo number [2] to: 'A stray ray of light reflects eerily off the stone cats' eyes.'
 
4) Please change echo number [3] to: 'The bigger of the two sculpted ferrets barks an insult at nobody in particular.'

      <desc>The two hedgehogs are indistinguishable from one other, except for their 
attitude.  Whereas one looks shy and prone to curling up in defence, the 
other holds up its head and shows its teeth in a snarl.  This probably

However, these two statues wear low-slung loincloths, a Greek-looking 
breastplate, and a cloak.  Almost hidden by curly locks, their foreheads 
bear the identical mark of the number two in Roman numerals.  On their 
breastplate is the same motif, as well as the inscription &quot;Gemini, the 
Dioscuri twins&quot;, although the &quot;Dioscuri&quot; part is scratched out, and below is 
scribbled instead: &quot;Weasley&quot;.  While one twin is standing west from the 
other and looking east, the other, like a mirror image, looks to the west.  
Between them, side by side, sit two dogs.  Behind them are two cats, two 
ferrets, and finally two hedgehogs.

ferret weights around four pounds and measures a little less than a foot and 
a half, the west-sitting one is twice as big.  Furthermore, the latter 
speaks up from time to time, though only to let out curt or downright rude

twinkling like stars of the Milky Way.  Bright and lustrous, they bloom in a 
never-ending line.  They are designed by Mother Nature in a unique way.  The 
beauty of a rose blooming out of a bud is like that of a single lotus in the 
midst of a lake.  The contrast colours of the stem and the flower make it 
look even more attractive.  Their large and dark shadow covers the ground, 
making an attractive design on the dry earth.  Tall trees lean on these 
plants nearly covering them.  During summer, the leaves of these trees and 
the shrubs wither away and cover the dusty ground.  This deeply scented 
garden continues southeast.  A stone pathway is towards the east.  Wide open 
grounds unfold in all other directions.

    <desc>Covered in dust here is a stone pathway.  It is wide and long; slabs of grey 
and black rocks are etched into the ground.  A border made of red bricks 
cover the rough edges of the road.  Tall trees grown in deep red soil lean 
low, thus providing shade to passers-by.  Decorative ferns to the sides 
beautify the place.  A few flowering plants also grow here, yielding 
colourful, wild blossoms.  The plantations shower the ground with dry and 
crisp leaves.  This path extends southeast.  Wide open grounds stretch 
north, northeast, southwest, and northwest.  A beautiful rose garden lies 
east, south, and west.

    <desc>In this patch of earth, bunches of multi-coloured roses toss their heads in 
a sprightly dance.  The blossoms are curled and look like a whirlpool in an 
ocean of beauty.  During dusk, they fold their lovely petals like a 
touch-me-not plant, and at daybreak they unfold like a lazy person woken out 
of his sleep.  At sunset, it looks like the sky and earth are about to meet 
in this unique place.  Sharp and pointed thorns protect the flowers, which 
are like graceful maidens.  Dry, crispy leaves are scattered on the dusty 
ground.  This garden continues southeast and southwest.  Open grounds 
stretch north, east, northeast, and northwest, while a stone pathway lies 
west and south.

    <desc>The heavy, overwhelmingly sweet scent of roses drowns the air here into a 
thick, perfumed daze that surrounds grass, seasonal flowers, and a few 
trees.  Through a wall of bushes and occasional willows, stretching north, 
northeast, and northwest, slithers a rustic, peaceful path, emitting 
occasional, jewel-like sparkles.  Deep crimson and in full bloom throughout 
the warmer parts of the year, a garden takes up the west and the south 
sides; a southwestern path allows free passage amidst the fragrant, wild, 
and proud rosebushes.  Fugitive shadows, seemingly unconnected to their 
surroundings, drift in from the eastern side, as though living an existence 
of their own.  A patch of peaceful, patient oaks bend their boughs lovingly 
upon a small path leading southeast, further into the grounds.  Above the 
level, thick, lush grass looms the steadfast silhouette of the nearby 
Hogwarts Castle, rising like a phoenix from its ashes beyond the northern 
path.

      <desc>These oaks are gnarled and bent by old age and fierce wind, their bark 
exuding a soft, sweet perfume, as though the scent of a lake were embedded 
into the very core of these trees.  The deft hands of some 
artistically-inclined students have left marks against the old trunks: 
initials, short messages, and even curse marks.  A few hairballs having 
probably belonged to a very white, medium sized mammal - a cat or perhaps a 
ferret - are for some reason knotted between some old twigs.

    <desc>The lovely, whispering, swaying silhouette of a patch of willows to the 
north, east, and northwest smoothly falls here into a carpet of unruly 
grass, bordered by wild bushes.  Shifting and dancing against the seasonal 
lush-green of the shy blades are passing shadows, whirling and turning with 
an invisible wind.  Everlasting, regardless of weather or passers-by, the 
astonishing ballet of shapes and vivid images continues on unperturbed, as 
though it has a life of its own.  The ground is level and smooth; the moving 
shadows group and ungroup like a methodical kaleidoscope intent on drawing 
every possible shape out of its colourful fragments.  A rose garden bathes 
the southwestern vista into crimson beauty; into the northern distance rises 
the imperturbable Hogwarts Castle.  The soft whispers of a lake drift into 
the soft, sweetly-perfumed air from far beyond the eastern willows.  The 
grounds stretch magnificently further to the south, west, northeast, and 
southeast.

    <desc>A gentle moisture lingers in the air, blooming and swirling with the soft, 
delicate scent of willows.  The trees trace a small, sand-filled path with 
their elderly roots and languid, swaying arms, leaving only a small streak 
of the heavens visible beyond their thick boughs.  Their perfumed bark is 
clad in thick coats of overprotective shrubs and bushes.  Seasonal, crimson 
flowers blossom against masses of dark-green leaves, like droplets of blood 
on the skin of a careless child.  The thin lane heads east and northwest, 
littered with streaks of polished pebbles; their otherwise-dazzling, white 
surfaces have an illusionary, golden tinge as they reflect the bowed heads 
of the whispering willows.  Passage between the trees is possible in every 
direction; far to the west and to the southwest, a bleeding mass of crimson 
roses exudes heavy, sweet scents.

    <desc>A thin path of coarse sand and polished pebbles slithers here between an 
overgrowth of low bushes and swaying willows.  Waxed, dark-green leaves 
caress each other in the thicket, at the ends and sides of knobbly, brown 
branches.  In the warmer part of the year, the shrubs appear to drip crimson 
droplets of blood in the shapes of intense flowers with fine, soft petals.  
The willows have slender bodies, occasionally scarred by an overenthusiastic 
woodpecker; their long, soft hair moves in a fantastic, gentle dance against 
the sweetly-perfumed air.  Only a sliver of the sky is visible between the 
elderly trees, wreathed in the golden-green of their lovely crowns.  To the 
east, the path opens up towards the lake, losing itself deeper in the 
western thicket.  Between the bushes, free access is granted in all other 
directions into the surrounding, rolling grounds.

outlined the dark walls of the Hogwarts castle, and of the outer wall to the 
south.  A circle is centerd, well, on the middle of the patch.  Its edge, 
about a foot wide, is cleared of grass.  In the middle of both the band and 
the area stands a sun dial.  Starting from the bald ring, eight paths run 
away in every direction.

    <editdraftcomments>I like your sundial here, carole :) it's a very nice touch.  I changed your 
wording in 2 of your sentences, because when reading them outloud I found 
them a bit awkward, so I hope this makes more sense.  And also, just the 
normal adding in commas and changing your plural vs.  Singular words (i.  E. 
 Your last sentence.  Directions should be singular).  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>I like your echoes!  #1 though should be 'off', not of, and in #2, I think 
underfeet should be underground, so it makes more sense.  I've edited, also, 
all 3 of your eds, so please have a peek at them!  I do love your writing 
carole, I learn a new word every time.  :) keep up the great work!  `-mira

    <editfirst>This patch of grass is almost perfectly (centred) between the eastern flower 
beds and the western Quidditch Pitch.  Further away (to the north) 
outline(s) the dark walls of the Hogwarts (C)astle, and the outer wall to 
the south.  A circle is (centred) well on the (middle) of the patch.  Its 
edge, (about a foot wide), is cleared of grass.  In the middle of both the 
band and the area stands a sun dial.  Starting from the bald ring, eight 
paths run away in every direction.  
</editfirst>
    <editfirstcomments>about the desc: all suggestions are duly noted. Although, can a object outline itself? shouldn't it rather be outlined (against something)? I'm not sure of either, just wondering.
 
 
 
About the paths ed: Yes, the Ouroboros represents an animal (a snake); why are you asking mira?

      <desc>This cleared band of grass is covered in a red, white, and black coating; it 
represents a serpent devouring its tail, an Ouroboros.  The red scales are 
small, and outlined in black.  The red irises are encased between the white 
sclerotic and the black slitted pupil, while the white teeth show in the 
wide-open maw.

      <desc>The sun dial is laid simply on a slightly-thinner, red column.  The face 
itself is coloured blood-red with black, metal incrustations of roman 
numerals and a metal, black gnomon casts its shadow over it.  An 
tail-devouring-snake motif runs along the plate's edge.

      <desc>The grass is dark-green and contrasts with the red of the band and of the 
dial.  The paths are laid with the red same coating as the ring is.  As they 
radiates from the outer edge of the circle, they add a somewhat solar motif 
to the existing Ouroboros pattern and thus complement neatly the sun dial.

    <editdraftcomments>Carole, this room is really great!  I must apologize, in your previous 2 
rooms, I didn't put what I changed inside parenthesis ( ).  But I did for 
this one!  :D I'm an idiot.  Just a few grammar things changed here.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>Your echoes are great, and I've edited both of your eds, so have a look.  
You sporadically have spelling errors, like 'thicly' instead of 'thickly', 
so make sure you are using Word or something equivalent to catch those tiny 
errors.  :) I do like your style of writing though!  `-mira 
 
To add to Mira's comments, I've edited both your eds, tweaking the wording here and there. Please let me know if I did anything wrong. Love, Cristina

    <editfirstcomments>About the &quot;69&quot;: I like it. However, I've *got to* follow the zodiacal order; thus, unless we shift the entire patch one noth south, Cancer should probably stay in Room 2865

    <editsecondcomments>This room is overall excellent; however you seem to have had a similar problem in all the rooms that I've edited this morning: you keep saying that the Castle is north and the wall is south of here. While that is true in a large-scale sense, if the player tries to go north, they will be confused that there is no castle there. Please therefore add the &quot;far&quot; &quot;distant&quot; etc adjectives to your directions. Otherwise, well done on writing this room, and you're awesome! `-Cristina

      <desc>This sculpted creature is, in fact, a Fire Crab.  Contrary to what its name 
suggests, it resembles more closely a large tortoise than a crab.  The 
heavy, huge shell is laden with thousands of jewels of all sizes, shapes, 
and colours.  Some are cabochon, others show a myriad of facets, and yet 
others are simple, geometric forms; their sizes range from fist-wide to tiny 
pinpricks.  The gems are sprayed in an array of colours that is similarly 
phenomenal, with fire or pinkish red, deep or aqua blue, grass or sea green, 
golden or orange yellow, garnet or lilac purple.  All the hues in creation 
seem to have gathered here on this statue.  The only place bare of gems is 
the head of this Fire Crab.  On the forehead is a symbol, looking like the 
number sixty-nine seen sideways; below that is written &quot;Cancer, the Crab.&quot;

      <desc>The seasonal grass here is simply the Muggle sort.  The green blades are 
short and trimmed, so that the occasional gust of wind doesn't have much to 
bend and sway.  Amongst the lush carpet run eight, straight paths.  Though 
the pebbles that make up these lanes are suspiciously bright-white for being 
treaded upon, they are laid without rhyme or reason; these abundant stones 
overflow the edges of the paths and trickle over to the grass.  In some 
places, they are thickly accumulated, making it difficult to walk as they 
roll under occasional, passing feet, whereas in other regions, they make 
such a thin cover that they reveal the brown, soft earth underneath.

    <desc>Here lies a seasonally-florid field covered with daisies, tulips, and many 
other types of flowers that all come in bright, vivid colours.  During the 
warmer seasons, the blooms grow close together, with their petals and leaves 
upturned in order to soak up any light that may come their way.  The 
scattered drops of lively colours appear particularly partial to growing 
around a tall apple-tree, enchanted to grow apples all year round.  The 
fruit come in various shades of red, ranging from a sanguine, ruby hue to a 
dull maroon.  As dark brown as the trunk, branches grow out in every 
direction; thick roots, throbbing with life, sink deeply into the ground.

    <editdraftcomments>Dear Shannon, your rooms are always such a pleasure to read! Your beautiful soul comes out so nicely in these Grounds rooms! The few edits I did are more connected with fluency and a bit with repetitions. I've altered the last sentence somewhat, in order to diminish the number of commas; however, this is only a suggestion, so feel free to change it if you wish. Also, please let me know if you decide to keep all the edits or you'd like to change stuff so I can come visit this delightful place again.
 
Thanks so much for all you're doing, Shannon, it's greatly appreciated! `-Cristina

    <desc>Sweet, multi-coloured roses bloom here.  It seems that the deep-red earth is 
laughing in these wild, spontaneous flowers.  A heavenly aura permeates the 
air as soon as a person comes this way.  It seems like all the colours in 
the universe have been spread into these blossoms.  They look like a diamond 
necklace around a maiden's neck.  Delicately designed, these blooms are a 
very rare specimen of extravagant beauty.  Rooted deeply, with silky petals, 
they are boon of Mother Nature to mankind.  This wonderfully designed patch 
extends south, northeast, and northwest.  A stone pathway, covered in dust, 
stretches north, east, and southeast, while wide open grounds stretch to the 
west and the southwest.

    <desc>This patch of seasonal grass lies midway between the harsh, distant lines of 
the western Quidditch Pitch, and a far, blurry mass of eastern flower beds.  
The angular profile of the Hogwarts Castle looms a distance away to the 
north, whereas the southernmost vista is barred by an outer wall.  White, 
pebble paths wind through the grass from every direction, up to a mighty 
tree.  Two statues of snakes surround the golden-beige trunk, forbiddingly 
white.  The seasonal lawn starts about a foot from a few outgrown roots, and 
it extends outwards from there.  A few white pebbles are stranded from some 
of the paths and mar the thick, pale-green, grassy carpet.

    <editdraftcomments>I know our minimum length requirement is 4 sentences, but I would really 
love to see a bit more description in this room!  And you've used the phrase 
'dark sihoulette' quite a few times, maybe change that wording here as well, 
just to give us some variety!  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>My only comment for your echoes is to make vibrates vibrate in #2, and I've 
edited both of your eds.  Please, please start using Word before submitting 
your work.  You use 'extand' every time, and spellcheck would have easily 
caught that, as well as your previous tiny spelling errors.  Otherwise, 
great work!  Your creativity for echoes always impresses me.  :) *huggles*

      <desc>The tree stands tall and wide; its proud stance tells of centuries of 
patient, longitudinal growing, and its branches extend tall and strong, 
leafy in summer, bare in winter.  The pale leaves are thin and strangely 
extend skywards, adding to the overall-lean silhouette of the plant.  The 
bark is golden-beige and all of its gnarls and crevices are oriented 
upwards, yet again participating to the vertical feel of the ensemble.

      <desc>The two snake statues are made out of pure-white marble, and tiny scales are 
engraved all along their body.  Their heads look almost friendly as their 
mouths are closed, though with the corners of their lips twitching slightly 
upwards; in addition, their eyes are rounded.  Both creatures coil 
symmetrically around the tree in numerous turns until their heads are 
levelled with the tip of the tree.  Large, feathered wings expand on their 
necks.  Together with the tree, they draw a caduceus figure.

    <editdraftcomments>Just a handful of tiny adjustments here, I really like this outdoorsy room, 
:) makes me want to go to the beach, hehe.  
</editdraftcomments>
    <editeds>I like your echoes here :) for #2, I think it would be best worded: The 
statue blinks repetitively, maybe due to a speck of dust in its eye.  And 
would a sphinx be awake 24/7?  I'm not familiar with the creature, but if 
not, you'll need to adjust the times of your echo, as you have it yawning 
and active all day.  I've edited, also, both of your eds so take a look!  
Thanks.  `-mira

    <editfirst>Close to the east lie(s) the blurred outline of flower beds, (and a 
towering) sandstone wall to the Quidditch Pitch.  More stone walls loom to 
the south and north respectively, of the outer wall and of the Hogwarts 
castle.  The ground is covered with sand, and half-concealed brick paths 
lead in all directions.  In the middle of the patch, on a low dune, sits the 
statue of a Sphinx.

    <editfirstcomments>I've realized the first sentence of my draft was missing the Quiddith Pitch's direction, hence the somewhat confused phrasing. It should have been &quot;Close to the east lies the blurred outline of flower beds, whereas to the west towers the sandstone wall to the Quidditch Pitch.&quot; What do you think of it?
About the sphinx being active 24/7, it's the same problem as room 2856: it isn't a real animal, but a statue. So, in my reasoning, it doesn't sleep. But then again, just tell me if you'd rather I change the hours.

      <desc>The bricks of the paths look like compacted sand.  (Each) golden grain (is) 
visible.  The edges of these blocks are frayed, and the corners (are) 
rounded.  Several of them are rickety.  Sand, (infiltrates) every (crevice), 
only (making) this worse.

      <desc>This statue represents a Sphinx, pacing.  The face is unmistakenly feminine, 
with its slender features, full-lips, and almond-shaped eyes.  The latter 
are almost constantly half-closed with an air of mystery, while her mouth 
stretches in a shrewd grin.  Her aureate hair is cut in a Betty-Boop-like 
bob, and frames her forehead; a pale sign faintly shines on it, a circle 
from which springs a long tail in an inverted-U shape.  This motif is 
carried over in the shape of her earring; the latter also feature an 
inscription, &quot;Leo, The Lion&quot;.  The hair then blends pretty seamlessly into 
the mane-less, lean, feral body of a lioness.

    <desc>Chipped and scarred by the merciless branches of the many trees growing on 
its southwestern side, the wall smoothly and gently slithers southeast, 
towards the lake.  To the northwest, the wall trails off towards the main 
gate.  The granite surface is covered by soft moss, attracted, no doubt, by 
the thick dampness in the air.  As the ground towards the Lake descends in 
altitude, the barrier reveals more of its strong, deep roots.  These are not 
made of blocks, but of an entire stone base that runs beneath the massive 
structure.  A carpet of fresh grass stretches between the wall and the 
Quidditch Pitch, the magnificent Hogwarts Castle to the northeast, and even 
as far as the Forbidden Forest, to the north.  Amidst the green blades grow 
bushes and, in season, passionate, blood-hued roses, A discrete, sweet scent 
lingers in the air, mixed with the pronounced freshness of the nearby water.

      <desc>The far edges of the lake are too far to glimpse, but as far as the eye can 
see, the vast water is surrounded by trees and rocks.  Willows with long, 
elegant arms and fingers bend low over the clear mirror, stirring it 
occasionally and tenderly.  Some water lilies decorate the blue surface in 
the warmer months of the year, while algae, moss, and weeds surround the 
numerous stones by the lake side.  Whenever a sunray breaks against the 
waves, it erupts into nimbuses of light.

      <desc>The frog is quite large, white on its belly and green with dark spots on the 
back.  It swells impressively as it ribbets against the night air, probably 
proclaiming the day's deeds to other, smaller creatures of its kind.  There 
are small scars running along its side, looking as though they were made by 
a sharp-tipped instrument.
