    <desc>This turtle has a dark, green, rock-like shell with black eyes like small coals that are rigid with caution. He walks with a slight wobble, and only little faster then a snail due to his portly body. His shy nature causes him to hide in his shell at the slightest sound of a noise. His shell is scratched and worn with age, but still looks very similar to a rock.

    <desc>This particular squirrel has piercing black and brown eyes. Her dark red-brown fur circles her stomach which is a plain, snowy-white. her ears are short and pointed, but covered in fur.Her tail is extrodinarily bushy and a bit darker red the the rest of her body. She jumps through trees eagerly, trying not to draw attention to herself in fear that she would be attacked by a large bird or preditor. Being a squirrel she stops whatever she is doing whenever she hears a noise and sniffs the air uncertainly before holding still as a statue.

Despite his uncaring attitude he can be extremely vain at times, hissing at anyone who dares come close.

    <desc>This laid-back cat is covered by a short, luxurious, blue-grey coat.  Warm light effuses from his plush fur.  His intelligent, orange eyes look around placidly, though quickly looks in the direction of distinct sounds.  This loyal feline is graced with well-formed muscles, allowing him to be an exceptional hunter.

The plumage is coffee-coloured along his back, as well as his head, with a slight variation of additional russet-coloured ones.  His tail feathers are bluish-black tipped in white.  The top view of the wing's plumes is auburn tipped in black; however, the underside is white.  His wide wing-span allows him to circle or swoop in low altitudes.

    <desc>One of the largest birds in the world, this Bubo Bubo is powerful with a wingspan longer than six feet in length.  He has drastically elongated ear tufts starting above his eyes; they appear like feathered eyebrows continuing well above his head.   His keen, striking, orange eyes track the slightest movement allowing him to swoop quickly upon his prey.   Nature endowed him with striating feathers of black, white, and camel colours as well as sharp, black talons and beak.

    <desc>A little over a foot tall, this Common Barn Owl's wings, golden and brown like the feathers on her back, span three feet across.  Her belly, snowy white freckled with tiny brown spots, causing her to look like a ghostly apparition at night.  She has quite a remarkable, ivory-coloured face with humanoid expressions since she has a large forehead and her eyes are set at the front of her broad, flat faces.  Her face is circled by a golden border with her beak slanting downward, lending to her humanlike appearance.

    <desc>Short, curly, ruby-red hair bounces around this lady's rosy-cheeked visage.  She's a curvaceous woman, middle aged, and has a cheerful appearance.  Her nut-brown eyes, as large as her smile, twinkle mischievously.  She's wearing faded jeans, a red, flannel shirt tied up around her flat stomach, as well as crimson cowboy boots.  She has also donned a cherry red, wizard's robe cut above her elbows, edged in embroidered, yellow daisies.  The front of her robe is designed with an open slit down the middle, bordered on each side with the same wavy, daisy pattern as on the sleeves, which she has tucked back behind her jeans.

Every once in a while he stops and cleans his grey, blue, white, and green, feathers of muck and dirty water that falls upon them when he dives underneath to catch fish. His eyes are made to stare into the water for hours until a fish finally comes swimming by and he is able to snatch it up and swall it whole.

Her tail is curled tightly around her stout hind legs. Her brillant green eyes shine with anger at anyone who dares come near her. The only part of her that looks throughly taken care of are her sharp, long claws.

    <desc>A tan stoat sits here with its big black eyes. He is clearly no older then a year, and has a small body for a stoat. Whenever someone walks by he scurries out of reach and peers out at everyone with curiousity brimming in his dark, limpid eyes.

    <desc>A small, walnut-coloured wood mouse sits here timedly. He sniffs the air tentively and generally tends to blend in. He stares around with dark, round eyes. His tail is longer then a field mouse's, and is relatively widder too. He acts rapidly and darts from place to place quickly, trying to avoid all living things and can't seem to differentiate friends from foes.

She hops around self-consciously and doesn't hesitate to dart under the nearest bush or anything small that she can hide under. Her fur is nice and it is hard to tell that she has been through a hard time with predators and other large animals that hunt hares. Her ears hang down by her side when scared or frightened, and never exposes her soft, white stomach to anyone or anything.

    <desc>At a glance, this old, ravaged man seems to be tanned; on further 
inspection, however, he's just plain dirty. His short and stumpy build would 
give him the appearance of a teenager if it were not for the wrinkled eyes 
and ragged beard. His head and face are entirely coated in dirt-strewn, 
brown hair, with single, grey locks poking through. Several bugs and boll 
weevils fizz and whirr around his snagged and ripped rags. He gives off the 
rather odd odour of burnt jam.

stance. His police cap falls down over his forehead, obscuring his eyes from 
plain view. His uniform is tardy; a pristine white shirt flops out over his 
belt and his navy blue utility vest hangs from his shoulders. His tie 
dangles effortlessly from his collar which is unbuttoned and loose. His skin 
is pale but coated with a sea of afternoon stubble. A nametag is pinned to 
his hanging vest reading: '`#`sWinters`#`x'.

finest cuisines. His police uniform is crudely stretched around his body and 
his shirt, poking through his vest, seem's like it wished to pop open. His 
tie is thin and creased, the bottom half trapped in between ripples of his 
flab. His pink-nearly-red face is as strained as his shirt, giving the 
impression that somebody was standing behind him, pumping his body with air. 
A neatly cut, black goatee travels around his lips and under his nose. A 
nametag on his vest clearly shows: '`#`sPorkins`#`x'.

long, jet-black suit trousers fall elegantly over his shiny, leather 
dress-shoes. His shirt is as white as white could get, and his tie is as 
black as the night. His dark protective vest hugs his body tightly with the 
zip done up all the way to the top. A tall bobby-hat is positioned perfectly 
over his head, as his tanned and friendly face pokes out perkily underneath. 
A small tag is clipped immaculately to his vest, with the name: '`#`sMcKinnley`#`x' 
printed onto it.

      <desc>The ruins of an organ lie in the shadows near the back of the church.  Beneath the thick layers of dust and debris there is a faint glow of faded cherry wood varnish.  The organ is forced apart with a large oak beam and has strips of missing wood and varnish.  The middle shelf of keys is collapsed upon the bottom which has several missing keys and 3 twisted in very strange angles.  Most of the pipes which were formerly attached to the back of the organ have now collapsed to the ground with the exception of five.  Two of the remaining pipes are hanging as if they are about to fall any minute, while a third is leaning safely against a fallen beam.  The remaining two pipes have a fair sized gap in between them giving a strange and almost sad appearance to what remains of a once grand organ.

`sAbout Us`X
 
We are Project Legilimensia, Mugglenet's game developers.  Legilimensia:Morsmordre is a RPIMUD (Roleplaying Intensive Multi-User Dimension) that allows you the freedom of interacting and expressing yourself with other players through roleplay (or RP for short).  Since there is no hard-coded magic system, you have the luxury of creating and describing your own spells.  Morsmordre features a moderated, freeform player vs. player combat system to simulate duels.  You are free to emote your own battles in private or request one of our game's judges to arbitrate and challenge your RP skills. You are encouraged to develop your character's history, personality, and decisions to enrich your experience on this game, as well as help create the numerous plotlines woven into the environment.
 
In addition to our RP system there are quests, objects, and non-player characters to interact with.  We are continually developing additional quests for those who feel adventurous.  For some time Project Legilimensia has had another enterprise underway, building a fully-integrated, next-generation MUD based on JKR's world.  For more information on Legilimensia:Morsmordre, as well as our main project, please visit our forum at: http://lumos.mugglenet.com/forums/index.php

`sThe Storyline`X
 
Little Hangleton is the rural community Lord Voldemort's parents inhabited before their untimely deaths.  As you probably have heard, many years later Lord Voldemort's powers vanished, as well as his body, when he attempted to kill the infant Harry Potter.  Thirteen years later, in the graveyard of Little Hangleton, Lord Voldemort magically formed a new body for himself, as if rising from the grave. The night he emerged, Voldemort failed, once again, in his vain attempt to finally vanquish Harry Potter. Enraged at the escape of this boy from Lord Voldemort's grasp, a band of rogue Death Eaters disrupted the peaceful life of Little Hangleton, terrorizing the inhabitants all in the name of revenge. Besides the frightened wizarding community, this heinous event left the hamlet full of petrified and mystified Muggles struggling with the horrific memories of the battle and adversaries they could not fight.                                                  
 
The Ministry of Magic (MoM for short), the administration who regulates the magical community in the United Kingdom, were appalled at the destruction wreaked upon the small hamlet by, what they believed in the beginning, a band of miscreant wizards instead of Death Eaters...though eventually that hypothesis changed. In order to keep their secret wizarding life intact and to facilitate what harmony the Muggles once had before the devastation, the MoM performed a spell upon the inhabitants. All Muggles, whether living in or visiting the village, have their memories and any mention of this disastrous event altered, making every wizard or magical being appear as ordinary citizens or animals.  
 
Several wizarding families already resided in Little Hangleton before this ghastly event occurred.  After the enchantment had been performed upon the locale, the MoM asked these families to keep a watchful eye on the village.

`sThe Main Families and Travellers in Little Hangleton`X

`yExamining Your Surroundings`X
 
First off, if any instructions are given to you, by means of looking at the help list, or by other characters or an immortal, anything in &lt; &gt; is the word to type.  Do not type the &lt; or &gt; symbols.  
 
Next, to see what the room looks like, type: `ylook`X or try using `yL`X.  To look at a player (called a PC), type: `ylook &lt;name&gt;`X.  Next, if you're interested in what an object looks like, type: `ylook &lt;object&gt;`X.  To see a non-playing character (called a NPC) or an animal/creature, type: `ylook &lt;name&gt;`X.  Some items that are 'paper' related, like this Little Hangleton Handbook, can be explored by typing: `yread &lt;item&gt;`X.

`RAmbling About Little Hangleton`X
 
To move between rooms in this game you need to type the direction you would like to go.  The possible directions available in Little Hangleton are`R north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, up, and down`X.  You can abbreviate these directions with: `Rn, s, e, w, ne, nw, se, sw, u,`X and `Rd`X.
 
Following the room description is a mini-map that indicates where you are located and where you may go.  If you do not see the mini-map, it is most likely indicating that the room is dark from night or the type of room it is.  You will need to use a source of light to see within said room.  Closed doors will not be shown on the mini-map.  You will have to open the doors to see them displayed on the mini-map.
 
To ascertain what exits are available, type: `Rexits`X.  Not all existing exits may be labelled in the room or the exit list.  Some appear hidden, but simply have a closed door.  To exit the room you will have to first locate the door, either by information given in the room description, or by typing a direction to see if it states there is a closed door, etc. To open the door, type: `Ropen &lt;direction&gt;`X.  Once the door is opened, type the direction once more to walk through.  If you see a direction in `R( )`X, this indicates the exit has an opened door, meaning you can walk through and/or close it.  To close a door, type: `Rclose &lt;direction&gt;`X.  If you are unable to open a door it's a signal that you need a key or password to get through.  If you obtain a key, type: `Runlock &lt;direction&gt;`X and then proceed to open the door as normal.  
 
Even if there is no appearance of an exit, there can be a 'hidden' exit.  Exits that are concealed can lead you to something valuable or be the starting point of a quest.  To ascertain if there's a hidden exit, you need to pay special attention to the room descriptions, any possible items mentioned in the description that can be looked at, fleeting bits of information that flit through the room (called echoes), or conversations you have with NPCs.  At this point you must figure out how to open the exit (again, by keywords, keys, or passwords) or as if using a 'normal' exit.
 
In some inns and shops if you type: `Rlist`X you can view the service or items for purchase.

`BPlayer Repartee`X
 
To chat with someone in the same room with you, use: `Bsay &lt;message&gt;`X.  To direct an exchange to one particular person in the same room with you, type: `Bsayto &lt;name&gt; &lt;message&gt;`X.  As a shortcut you may use an apostrophe, `B'`X instead.
 
To send a person a private message, type: `Btell &lt;name&gt; &lt;message&gt;`X.
 
To send a personal communique to another person on or off the game, you can use our note system.  Type: `Bhelp note write`X to read more about how to write notes.
 
To send a global message for help, you may use: `Bnewbie &lt;message&gt;`X.
 
To communicate on a global channel for out of character exchanges (use sparingly), type: `Booc &lt;message&gt;`X.
 
To chat with someone in a private room, type: `Bgoooc`X.  To return type: `Brecall`x.

`YObtaining Objects`X
 
To take objects, type: `Ytake &lt;object&gt;`X.  Or, if you prefer, use `Yget &lt;object&gt;`X.  To wear an item, type: `Ywear &lt;object&gt;`X and to remove it, type: `Yremove &lt;item&gt;`X.
 
To give something to another person that you're either holding or that is in your inventory, type: `Ygive &lt;item&gt; to &lt;name&gt;`X.  You can also just `Ydrop &lt;object&gt;`X to rid yourself of any item you possess.  
 
To check what supplies you have on your person, type: `Yinventory`X. To see what items you are using, type: `Yequipment`X.  Additionally, you can use: `Yshow &lt;item&gt; &lt;name&gt;`X to show another player a certain item.  While you are wearing/holding an item or have it in your inventory, another player can't see the full detail of said object.  Showing the object allows others to see what you see.
 
If you are in a room without light, all you will see in your inventory is the light itself, until you type: `Yhold &lt;light source&gt;`X.  To rid yourself of all your articles, type: `Ydrop all`X.
 
If you try to `Ylook`X at an item, but see a different description than you should, you are probably holding an item that uses the same keywords as the item you wish to view.  For example, if you are holding a red rose and try to look at a red robe in the room you're occupying, it will most likely show you the rose instead.  If you are looking at an item and not receiving the description you should, please try to `Ylook &lt;different word&gt;`X.

`gPlayer Personification`X

For `g`X`groleplaying (RP)`X`X`X, socials allow you to perform actions in the game that make your stay with us seem more personal.  To see a list of socials you may perform, type: `gsocial`X.  Some socials can be directed to other players.  To do so, type: `g&lt;social&gt; &lt;target&gt;`X for example: `gsmile Harry`X.  `gsocshow &lt;social&gt;`X will give details on what action(s) the social does, but we'd advise you simply experiment and have fun. 
 
Emotes allow you to write your own personal interactions.  You do this by typing: `gemote &lt;your action&gt;`X.  For example, typing: `gemote thinks you are pretty`X would show up as: `g&lt;your name&gt; thinks you are pretty`X to everyone in the room.  You may use a comma `g,`X as a shortcut for 'emote'.  To learn about other 'motes' you can use, type: `ghelp pmote`X, `ghelp smote`X, and `ghelp amote`X.

`MMay We Be of Assistance?`X
 
To put items into receptacles, you type: `Mput &lt;object&gt; in &lt;object&gt;`X. 
 
To look into things, such as rucksacks, chests, wardrobes, etc., you can type: `Mlook in &lt;object&gt;`X.  If you wish to retrieve an item you find within, you must type: `Mtake &lt;object&gt; from &lt;receptacle&gt;`X. 
 
To get help on many of the things you will face in this game, use `Mhelp`X.  This will bring up a list of things you can get additional help on.  If you need additional aid, as some things are not on the help list, you can try one of a few ways.   Feel free to ask season veterans or ask on one of the global channels if an immortal is around to help you.  If you wish for private help feel free to send a `M&lt;note to immortal&gt;`X or, for even more privacy, send a `M&lt;note to admin&gt;`X which is seen by only three people on this game.
 
If you misplace an item please go to the Town Hall and talk to the secretary.
 
On a personal note, if you would like to add a detailed description of what you look like (it definitely enhances roleplay) type: `Mhelp description`X.  It will guide you on how to alter your appearance.

`RSafety Measures`X
 
Unfortunately, the internet is no different than 'real' life.  There will be people who are aggressive, and others that may try to make you uncomfortable.  There are steps you can take to ensure your feeling of safety and security on our game.
 
If someone is making you uncomfortable, but you don't feel in any immediate danger, please type: `cpray &lt;message&gt;`X.  If staff is on the game, we will come to your aid.  If a staff member is not on the game at that time, please send a `Ynote to Law`X detailing the situation -this note will be sent to the Judges, Immortals, and Admins.  If it is a judge who is harassing you, please send a `Bnote to Imm`X -this will reach both the Immortals and Administration.  If an immortal is harassing you, please send a `Gnote to Admin`X`X. We will try and deal with your complaint as promptly as we can.
 
If you are in immediate danger, or someone is persistently harassing you, there are several steps you can take:
 
1, type: `Rcrisis &lt;message&gt;`X -the message can be as simple as &quot;help&quot;.  If there is a staff member on the game, judge or immortal, we will immediately come to your aid.  As opposed to `cpray`X, this message broadcasts immediacy for staff to act without delay.
 
2, if there is no staff member in-game, and you feel comfortable using the out of character channel that every person playing the game sees, please type: `mooc &lt;message&gt;`X  - any staff available, and potentially any of the other players nearby will come to your aid.
 
3, if you are uncomfortable asking for help on any of the channels, but need sanctuary from an aggressor, there are a couple of things you can do:
 
A, type: `Mgoooc`X  -this will transfer you to a communal, out-of-character room.  From the common room go `Mnorthwest &lt;nw&gt;`X or `Mnortheast &lt;ne&gt;`X; these rooms are private.  No one will be able to get into those rooms except immortals.  This will allow you to escape the situation.  With this privacy you will be able to write a `Bnote to Imm`X or `Gnote to Admin`X in relative safety.
 
B, remember, if none of these options work, or you don't want to handle this in-game, you can ALWAYS type: `rquit`X and you will be immediately disconnected with all of your items saved.  Then you can go to our public forum http://lumos.mugglenet.com/forums/index.php and send a private message to Artemis, Calliope, or Darkly Marked.  The admin team will then handle it.

with a twining of silver fibres; the scaly, strong protection of the brown, 
dragon's skin drapes around this structure like an immutable glove.  
Difficult as it might be to believe it, even this protective shell is 
dented, scratched, and darkened as though severely burnt.  A flap serves as 
a main door in and out of this container; though it provides some breathing 
holes, the visibility within it is very limited.  A sickeningly-sweet scent 
exudes from within.

as many are convinced, in the knowledge of innumerable hexes and spells, but 
in remembering the most important ones.  This anthology is dedicated to the 
analysis of the Dark Arts and to the most appropriate measures one can take 
to protect oneself against them.  Recommended to wizards and witches older

Dumbledore remains to this day the most brilliant wizard that ever lived.  
Through many achievements that have revolutionised our way of understanding 
magic, he has become celebrated and honoured in most wizarding circles.  Not 
many, however, loved or even liked this genial mind: in fact many agree upon 
the fact that Albus Dumbledore was 'batty at the very least' and 'outright 
mad'.  In this, the mad genius is finally revealed and revered as he ought 
to be, to the satisfaction of all.&quot;  A small line is written underneath this 
paragraph: &quot;A well-deserved monument to the memory of the greatest wizard 
that ever lived - Olympe Maxime, Headmistress of Beauxbatons Academy.&quot;

      <desc>Say This newspaper is clearly an old edition, though some clever individual 
has spilled wax all over the date.  Amongst several trivial matters, such as 
the launch of a new, thick-bottomed cauldron and an analysis of temperature 
changes due to spellcraft gone wrong, is a very flashy article.  A large 
caption reads: &quot;Fickle Fudge or Sadistic Scrimgeour - the Old and New 
Power&quot;, placing the edition roughly within Rufus Scrimgeour's mandate as 
Minister for Magic.  However promissing the title is, however, the piece 
rambles over the office style employed by the two Ministers rather than 
their political views.  Two moving, black and white pictures show the two 
Ministers gesticulating fervently towards one another.

Originally, this (piece) of glass must have been clear as crystal, (the exterior is now) obscured by dirt and grime. Light barely passes through the smoky grey surface; what (little) light (able to) pass through comes out murky and distorted. Several particularly heavy streaks of dirt have formed on one of the shard's sides; the deep, earthy-brown prevents (most of the) light from (permeating). One (of the edges) is smooth, probably from years of exposure to the elements. The rest is still extremely sharp as (though) newly broken. It is possible to see specks of reddish-brown near these edges, (resembling) dried blood.

various stages of blooming.  The flowers are miniscule and pale yellow, 
though their size makes this hard to distinguish.  The leaves are slightly 
spiked, strong and sharp enough to cause a small jolt of pain when touched.

fine cotton in a soft shade of buff; at first glance, the hull appears to be 
half-full of sand.  Tiny shelves of polished mahogany have been constructed 
under the gunwales; they are just large enough to stow a bedtime book or a 
pair of glasses.  Painted on the prow in bold, gold-limed letters is the 
name 'Discovery'.

      <desc>The pair of blue jeans is of good quality, with two frontal pockets and a 
single back pocket on the right side.  A smaller, discreet pocket stands 
just to the side of the right knee, big enough to hold a lover's letter or a 
small jewel.  The cut of these jeans is low, but not too low, allowing both 
buttocks to sit comfortably and fully covered, as long as no wand destroys 
them.

looking crisp and new.  The two back pockets are thin and wide, not creasing 
the fabric both when they are filled and when they are not.  The legs of 
these pants are nearly straight, although the cut widens slightly beyond the 
knee.

      <desc>This bench is made from a single, grey, polished rock, which is why, though 
smooth and inviting, the object has a rather simplistic shape and resembles 
a block of stone.  Its edges might have once been sharply straight, but 
heavy rain has rounded the surface all around, making it welcoming and 
curved.  Judging by its size and by the markings imprinted in the upper side 
of the rock, the bench could seat two at the most.

      <desc>This bench shows the effects of time and weather, though it wears these 
marks with pride.  Instead of appearing battered and broken, it merely gives 
it a well-used and well-loved appearance.  The ironwork that supports the 
bench is extremely intricate, though rust has managed to take a hold of some 
small areas.  The wood is like-wise worn; dirt marks and scratches adorn the 
wood, but it still seems to glow with warmth.  When light shines on it, the 
wood gleams a deep chestnut colour, complimenting the black of the iron.  
Surprisingly, no matter what the weather is like, the bench feels warm to 
the touch, though whether due to a spell or just nature is not quite clear.

in and out of the Lapiz Lazuli cloth as if it were melted into the very 
strands. The sleeves are wide, and drop swiftly coming from underneath the 
arm. The cloth misses the hsoulders leaving a large gap for the bearers 
shoulders to show through with a touch of beauty.

      <desc>Carved out of solid cherry, this bed has both a magnificently carved 
footboard and headboard.  The foot of the bed is carved to resemble an 
oriental fan, its blades inlayed with ivory.  Ornately carved posts spiral 
upwards at each of the front corners, their tops carved into griffon heads.  
While not graced with fanciful designs, the headboard does have carvings of 
geometric figures, namely squares and rectangles, that provide artistic 
interest.  Two posts also spiral upward from the back corners, their tops 
ending in gleaming wooden spheres.  All of the wood shines as though 
recently polished by loving hands; a faint scent of polish still seems to 
linger in the air.

with light, they glimmer, as if millions of tiny diamonds have been sewn 
into them.  Tiny patterns of vines and flowers can faintly be seen on the 
surface, almost as if they aren't actually there.

The handbook is split up into several sections that outline all the important features of the combat system. If any of the following sections confuse you, or you would like to know more about a certain topic; feel free to ask over the `#`cOOC-line`#`s, or even send a note to the `#`YRP council`#`s.`#`x

      <desc>`#`sChapter 2 `#`w- `#`sThe Basics
`#`r---------------------
 
`#`sHere on `#`gMorsmordre`#`s, combat is split up into two catagories: `#`RJudged `#`sand `#`CFreeform`#`s. Both of these systems were created to insure players have the best roleplaying enviroment possible. The combat itself is theory-based, which means there is no code or stats to pre-determine battle outcome. The difference between Judged and Freeform is that the Judged system includes a third party referee or mediator(known as a Judge), while Freeform does not. Both of these systems will be explained in detail in a later chapter.`#`x

      <desc>`#`sChapter 3 `#`w- `#`sWhat is a Judge?
`#`r----------------------------
 
`#`sA Judge is an impartial (`#`cOOC`#`s) third party bestowed with special abilities by the MUD admin to moniter and referee scenes. Ultimately their main purpose is to make sure a scene or general roleplay is fair. Judges are usually `#`WImmortals`#`s, however, as the staff may be busy working on the main MUD, some players have been selected to act as Judges. We only select Judges that are good roleplayers, trustworthy, and helpful. The Immortals also moniter the player Judges to make sure they are doing their jobs properly, while keeping the world fun and fair. Chances are, you will never see a Judge at work, they will be invisible to all mortals while out in the world. Due to their OOC nature, Judges are only represented in text sent to the room, so only you and those in the same room will see. This is how a Judge will communicate with you and is explained in more detail in the Judged combat section.`#`x
 
`#`sJudges can be called out in many different situations, not just for combat. For instance, If you were attempting to perform a spell of any kind, you could call a Judge to help see if you `#`Wsucceed`#`s or `#`Wfail`#`s. Success and Failure are depicted by using the '`#`YROLL`#`s' command. Roll on its own will roll a 100-sided die and display you a result, like: '`#`wYou roll a 100-sided die and it shows 100!`#`s'. In some situations a Judge may wish you to roll a specified sided dice, this can be done by typing: '`#`Yroll #`#`s' - The '`#`Y#`#`s' being a chosen number. This will randomly generate a number between 1 and the chosen number.`#`x

      <desc>`#`sChapter 4 `#`w- `#`sFreeform Combat
`#`r---------------------------
 
`#`sLets face it, if another had the opportunity to not have to go to school or work and come out of it with an education and money, we'd all choose it. Sadly, reality just is not like that and sometimes Judges won't be around to help. There may be none online or they may just be too busy, whichever the case, this should not hamper your roleplay. That's why we believe the best way to help you in this case, is to let you help yourselves. This is a `#`Wfreeform `#`ssystem; you can roleplay what you like and how you like - as long as all parties involved agree.`#`x
 
`#`RGodmoding`#`s or `#`RPower Emoting`'`s is not tolerated here or on any part of the game and any event of these occuring should be reported to the `#`YRP council`#`s. What is Godmoding or power emoting you may say? It's when a player roleplays for others. An example would be: '`#`wJack enters the inn and everyone around him trembles with fright.`#`s' It's not fair to other players; `#`wroleplay your own character, nobody elses`#`s. It doesnt take much common sense to know what you should or should not do within these guidelines, so please exhibit sound judgment for the sake of all. If you are a seasoned roleplayer then there may be times when a newbie messes up and does not realise it. If you are roleplaying with them, let them know their mistakes and try to help them improve rather than having a go at them. Problem characters will be taken care of and punishments will be handed out depending on the severity of the rule breach. This is your roleplay, your world, so try to have fun!`#`s

      <desc>`#`sChapter 5 `#`w- `#`sJudged Combat
`#`r-------------------------
 
`#`sThe Judged system is a little more complicated compared to the `#`wfreeform`#`s way. Simply because it involves a Judge `#`Wrefereeing`#`s the battle. The concept itself is very simple and extremely dynamic so it may seem that some battles feel different to others. Don't worry though, if you feel you do not fully understand the way things work, you can always ask an `#`WImmortal`#`s. A Judge will always help in battle by telling you what you must do next, so do not worry about trying to remember it all.`#`x

      <desc>`#`sChapter 6 `#`w- `#`sJudge Requesting
`#`r----------------------------
 
`#`sThe first step for Judged combat is to `#`Wrequest `#`sa Judge; this can be done by using the '`#`Yjudgetalk`#`s' channel. This channel works a lot like the `#`cOOC`#`s line except you won't see the output. Judges have their own special channel to communicate with each other and this command gives you the chance to put up a request straight to that line. An example for requesting a Judge would be: '`#`Yjudgetalk Is there a Judge available? I need one to come help with a fight!`#`s' When you hit enter you'll see a message telling you the request has been sent and it will be printed on the Judge channel. You won't see what you sent or see the channel at all, so make sure you've typed out what you want perfectly before hitting that enter button!`#`x

      <desc>`#`sChapter 7 `#`w- `#`sJudge Appearance
`#`r----------------------------
 
`#`sDepending on if a `#`RJudge`#`s is around to help, they will come to the room you are in. If a Judge is available, they will let their presence be known in some form, usually by `#`wechoing text `#`sto the room. Please be patient while waiting for a Judge, it is possible there may not be one around. In this case you won't recieve any confirmation of a Judge being on-game, which speaks for itself. Judges won't directly speak to you, but speak to the room. Remember that Judges are completely `#`cOOC`#`s(`#`cOut of Character`#`s) beings and must not be recognised in roleplay. They are always `#`Winvisible`#`s and only act as a third party to make sure rulings of the situation is fair. They must never be included in roleplay. Although the Judges are not included in your emotes or actions, they are very much involved in the scene itself. Chances are a Judge will know your character, will know certain `#`wtraits`#`s or `#`wspecialities`#`s of other characters, so this is where this system truly shines!`#`x

      <desc>`#`sChapter 8 `#`w- `#`sSituation and Rolling
`#`r---------------------------------
 
`#`sOnce the Judge makes his or her presence known, he or she will usually ask for an `#`wemote of the current situation`#`s. This helps the Judge greatly in improving how the battle adapts. If they know exactly whats going on - they can enhance the scene with some added personal extras!`#`x
 
`#`sWhen the Judge is `#`waware of the situation`#`w, they will ask you to '`#`Yroll`#`s'. This is achieved by using the '`#`Yroll`#`s' command to roll a random number between `#`w1`#`s and `#`w100`#`s. Depending on the Judge present, this scenario may alter; they may ask you to '`#`Yroll`#`s' a specific number. The number is how many sides the `#`wvirtual dice`#`s have and calculates a random number between 1 and the chosen number. You can choose how many sides the dice have by putting the chosen number after the roll command like: '`#`Yroll 10`#`s'. The `#`wdefault is 100 sides `#`sand rolls automatically when using '`#`Yroll`#`s' on its own. If a Judge doesnt specify how many sides, it is a `#`wdefault `#`s'`#`Yroll`#`s' on its own. Every player involved in the conflict rolls a number, this decides the turns in which players take; `#`whighest going first`#`s. If any players roll the same number, those players re-roll until everyone has a unique number.`#`x

      <desc>`#`sChapter 9 `#`w- `#`sEmotes and turns
`#`r----------------------------
 
`sOnce the turns are determined, the Judge will establish in which`X `Worder`X `sthe players will proceed. This ensures that everyone understands and allows the whole process to run smoothly. The Judge will then ask the`X `Whighest roller`X `sto emote their action. This can be whatever the player desires; it may be an`X `Wattack`X `sof some form, it may just be`X `wtalking,`X `Wit's up to you`X.  `sHowever, please remember while in battle to keep your emote in`X `RONE`X `sneat block, so not to spam the scene. Emote the action you decide on only once and -`X`RONLY`X`s- on your turn.`X
 
`sAfter the person emotes, the Judge will decide what action to take. If the person does not attack, then the Judge will proceed to the next highest roller's turn. If the person -`X`wdoes`X`s- wish to attack, then the Judge will provide a`X `wrolling check`X `sto beat. Depending on the situation, spell cast or action taken; a Judge will ask the person to`X `wbeat a special number`X. `sUsually a`X `wstandard 100-sided number`X, `sthey may ask the player to:`X '`Yroll 70+`X', `smeaning the player must roll`X `wabove 70`X `sto make the action successful. If it`X `wfails`X`s, the Judge will ask the player to`X `wemote the failure`X`s. If it`X `wsucceeds`X`s, it is then up to the target player to`X `wevade`X `sit somehow. The Judge will ask the`X `wtarget player`X `sto beat a certain number to`X `wevade, dodge, parry,`X `setc. If the evade is successful, the Judge will say so and specify just how well or badly you did. The player then may emote the action taken to dodge it.`X

      <desc>`#`sChapter 10 `#`w- `#`sRounds
`#`r-------------------
 
`#`sThe process `#`wcycles `#`saround giving each player a chance to attack. Once every player has had their `#`wturn`#`s, it will be the end of the `#`Wround`#`s. At the start of a new round, players will be asked to `#`wroll for their turns once again`#`s, re-evaluating the order. This gives players who may have been last in the previous round - a chance to get another go straight off the bat, mixing the `#`wpace `#`sand `#`wtide`#`s of the battle. When a `#`wnew round `#`sstarts, it is also the cue for anybody `#`wnew`#`s to the battle to join in. They will roll for a turn like the other players. This process will continue until the Judge determines who is unable to carry on or if another round is possible.`#`x
 
`#`sWhat a Judge says is `#`BLAW`#`s, they are there to make things better for you, so don't moan if you feel a battle should of had another round. If you do feel a Judge has treated yourself or someone `#`wunfairly`#`s; then please `#`wreport it`#`s to an `#`WImmortal`#`s or send a note to the `#`YRP council`#`s stating exactly what the problem is.`#`x

      <desc>`#`sChapter 11 `#`w- `#`sImportant Notes
`#`r----------------------------
 
`#`R- `#`sYou cannot use any unforgivable curses in game unless allowed by a Judge!
`#`R- `#`sKilling is not an option here! You cannot kill, so don't try!!
`#`R- `#`sNo Godmoding or Powermoting - `#`RWhatsoever`#`s!
`#`R- `#`sListen to the Judges! They love you, really!
 
`#`sI would also like to take this oppertunity to say that even though we do provide you with a dynamic combat system, we `#`Rdiscourage all combat`#`s as much as possible. This game isnt a '`#`rhack and slash`#`s' game, you arent here to kill each other. Given, there may be times when combat would compliment roleplay greatly, this is why we have developed this system, but it does not mean you have to fight every second of every day. `#`wEnjoy the game`#`s; `#`wexplore`#`s, `#`wmake new friends`#`s, `#`wroleplay`#`s and breathe in the atmosphere we've tried so hard to create. This is only a taster of what us staff here at `#`CProject Legilimensia`#`s are working so hard to achieve. We havent even tipped the iceberg yet, but we do hope you'll enjoy life here on `#`gMorsmordre`#`s with the staff. Thank you for playing and `#`GGOOD LUCK!`#`x

perfectly along with her sparkling grey eyes, her fiery hair, and her 
blood-red lips.  The snow-white skin of the puppet is enshrouded in a black 
mystic material, its texture neither solid, nor fluid.  It flows elegantly 
around the doll, following its sedated movements and an undisputable sense 
of lunacy that it constantly radiates.

      <desc>This bush is the epitome of untamed nature.  It consists of a chaotic 
assortment of branches, enough to almost block any view through it, even 
without any leaves present.  During the warmer months of the year, the 
leaves are highly concentrated near the centre of the bush, decreasing near 
the edges.  Tiny thorns protrude from the branches, snagging on anything 
that happens to come within its thorny reach while the bark is rough and 
cracked, giving it the appearance of reptile skin.  A few traces of 
attempted human dominance are visible; a few cut marks from a saw and a 
piece of twine grown over with bark, though these marks are highly obscured.

    <desc>The walls in this room appear as though they might once have been mint 
green, but have long since faded and are now a dingy shade of khaki, spotted 
here and there with tattered posters and obscure directional signs.  Buckled 
and blotchy linoleum covers the floor like a fungal growth.  One of the 
fluorescent lights overhead flickers erratically.  A long counter, surfaced 
in imitation wood-grain, guards the rear of the room; a daybook and pen lie 
waiting for a report to come in.  Battered chairs and outdated reading 
material are provided for visitors.  An iron, black door sits on a wall, 
radiating a rare, inviting glow.  The door leads east, to a lane.  The 
wire-mesh-reinforced windows are forbidding; an incongruous flower sits in 
the southernmost window, a glass tumbler serving as a vase.

Helpful directions are stenciled in flaking black gloss paint; with their

Serv', and 'Int'.  Posters serve to lighten the mood: one shows the twisted 
wreck of a car; the slogan at the bottom has been ripped away.  Another 
displays a scruffy-looking man in handcuffs being led away by a 
crisply-pressed bobby, the words 'Crime Doesn't Pay' blazoned across their 
knees.

    <desc>A cosy country road, no wider than ten feet, stretches from the west where 
it meets the door of a police station into the eastern distance.  The lane 
is cleared of most stones and invading plants; the few, tiny pebbles 
scattered across the dark-brown earth are polished and glisten in candid, 
golden nimbuses any time the tiniest ray of light catches them.  Nimble 
hedgerows, tall and thick like the chubby cheeks of a laughing child, are 
entangled with each other in a swaying mass of whispering, dancing green.  
At the very border, between these hedges and the road grow, in season, 
carefully-tended, scarlet, mauve, and white flowers.  The dismal sight of 
the dingy police station with plain, grey outer walls and a fully-black, 
iron door is in deep contrast with the single, light-blue flower placed at 
the southernmost window.

    <desc>. Lost in the passion of an everlasting, shivering, writhing dance, tall and 
thick hedgerows grow on either side of a small country lane.  A few 
isolated, linden trees grow amongst the chubby dancers; their generous shade 
and sweet aroma are embedded in the fields around.  In the warmer part of 
the year, just at the feet of the hedgerows grow shy, tender flowers, with 
laced petals hued scarlet, white, and soft pink.  Twigs and remainders of 
bird nests border the path, swept off by a diligent, order-loving hand.  
Imprinted with the wear of many footprints, the patient road has the shape 
of a cradle, its borders standing slightly higher than the centre.  
Polished, luminous pebbles litter its cappuccino-brown surface as the lane 
reaches eastward towards a wooden sign and westward towards a distant, dingy 
building.

are the first to emerge when spring comes; their aromas are soft and sweet.

    <desc>A wooden sign, weathered by winds, rains, and the insistent pecking of 
overenthusiastic birds, stands on the northern side of a beautiful lane.  
Surrounded by tall hedgerows and far-off, calming linden trees, the rustic 
path swells in the quiet passion of the English countryside.  Small twigs 
and branches lie scattered across the road, forming tiny enclosures around 
patches of seasonal flowers.  The tall stems of the hedgerows are covered in 
thick layers of writhing leaves that dance constantly, as though to a soft, 
languorous melody of the whispering wind.  Lost in the mass of green are 
tiny outlines of bird nests.  A soft, sweet perfume lingers delicately in 
the air, embedded in every blade of grass, in every shiny pebble on the 
road.  In the far, western distance is a depressingly-grey building; to the 
east, a fork in the road is barely discernible.

ground than the central streak; the path looks like a cradle with a smooth, 
pebble-decorated bottom.  A border of grass on either side of the road, 
littered with seasonal, scarlet, white, and baby-pink flowers, leads to tall 
hedgerows.  Amidst the writhing, chubby bunches of leaf-strewn twigs and 
stems are hints of bird nests.  The hedges sway, twirl, and twist in 
everlasting spirals, beating a dervish's mad, ritualistic passion against 
the surrounding air.  A small, northern opening in their perpetually-moving 
silhouettes reveals a large house, imbued with an air of pleasant peace.  
Providing some measure of shade are occasional trees, spreading a soft, 
sweet aroma that is etched into the very fibre of this English countryside.

A small, dirt path smoothly slips from Quickley lane towards the heavy, oak door of a large house. The walls of the cottage are embraced tightly by the tenderness of old ivy. The plant streams upward from the eastern corner of the building, its vines braided with each other and spread over any surface they can reach.

    <desc>The path breaks into a fork here.  Tall hedgerows cradle the road on either 
side, breaking into short, slender, fresh grass at the crossroad.  Luminous 
and cared-for, a lane goes on west and northeast; a dark, ruined path, 
strangled by angry-looking trees, stumbles southeast along a steep descent.  
Quickley Lane is smooth for the most part, decorated by occasional, shiny, 
polished pebbles that brighten up in golden halos every time a fleeting 
caress of light reaches them.  The earth is severely worn by old age; tiny 
imperfections along its surface mark where the heels of particularly 
insistent sets of shoes touched it.  At the feet of the hedgerows rise small 
flowers, ranging in colour from mauve to deep crimson; their heavy, sweet 
perfume mixes with the freshness of the surrounding bushes.

    <desc>A lane bordered by fresh hedgerows sedately stretches northeast and 
southwest, smooth and clean.  A stone driveway branches off northwest.  
While the dirt path is perhaps less sumptuous, it is lively and warm; this 
drive is, by contrast, cold and condescendingly perfect.  In season, fresh, 
blue, scarlet, and white flowers shyly raise their heads from amidst patches 
of slender, swaying grass; they exude a soft, sweet aroma that swirls in the 
air with any touch of wind.  To the southeast, unreachable beyond a wall of 
angry, twisted, nearly-leafless, old trees, is a small clearing around what 
looks to be a shack.

      <desc>The patch of trees that stretches in the southeastern valley is old beyond measure; their nearly-naked branches are thrown and contorted against any neighbouring trunks in a malevolent web that keeps any light away. The bark is almost peeling off the ancient, splintered tree arms; within the grumpy forest reigns an eerie, dark silence, still as death itself.

    <desc>A path not twelve feet wide effortlessly rolls along the side of a large 
hill.  The distant silhouette of a large manor, fallen into disrepair, 
overlooks the lane from the hilltop; the dismal, cold sight of it is nearly 
completely hidden by tall hedgerows growing on either side of the road.  It 
is as though the plants themselves are attempting to hide as much of the 
surroundings as possible and shield the peaceful, clean lane in a cocoon of 
writhing, rich, beautifully-dancing leaves.  Through a thinning in their 
branches, a forest with contorted, twisted trees can barely be glimpsed even 
farther down the steep slope.  There is, however, no way of reaching it; the 
hedgerows make sure the only possible exits are to the west, towards what 
looks to be a Grounds Keeper's cottage, and along Quickley Lane, northeast 
and southwest.

    <desc>A cosy-looking cottage covered in baskets emerges to the east from between 
tall hedgerows.  A small path, overgrown by soft grass, leads to the wooden 
door; there is no proper garden, but the collection of wild, entangled weeds 
with seasonal crimson, white, and blue flowers make a rather beautiful, 
exotic combination on their own.  By contrast, Quickley Lane is smooth, 
even, and clean, stretching northeast and southwest; the road is cradled 
between the hedgerows and littered with polished pebbles.  The path is 
slightly inclined, sloping down a hillside; from an impressive height, a 
large, abandoned manor overlooks the village from the northwestern side.  
There is no direct path towards it; the large hedgerows are stubbornly 
blocking all accesses.

      <desc>The wild garden of the basket-covered cottage is only kept away from the road by an enclosure of hedgerows. Tall blades of grass surround and entangle low rosebushes and slender stems ending in puffy, crimson flowers. Towards the small side path leading up to the house are small bluebells, their perfume softly sifting in the air along with the heavy scent of roses.

    <desc>The hedges that grow at the sides of the road break into rose bushes and 
then into grass, as Quickley Lane bends east and southwest at this point.  
In season, white and yellow roses grow between thorny branches that are 
gathered around the flowers like adoring, cupped, sharp hands.  A telephone 
box stands amidst the bushes and the grass, its red paint beginning to peel 
off with age.  It does not appear very well-used; indeed, it is more worn 
around the edges than along the door.  The main path is for the most part 
even, curving smoothly as tiny grass blades shyly border it.  A large, 
desolate-looking manor and an abandoned, ruined church overlook the path, 
from the peaks of two neighbouring hills, between which the way runs.

    <desc>The broad, handsome lane running northwest bends and sinks here into a 
crooked path downhill.  Rocks, the size and shape of untended teeth, crowd 
along a suffocated, sickly-yellow path.  The lane is cracked in many places, 
overgrown with all manners of small, dark-green bushes; most of these plants 
are huddled in crouching shapes looking like frightened porcupines, as they 
are covered in short, stubby needles.  A dense mass of trees with thick, 
twisted shapes rises entangled in its wilderness against both sides of the 
road; the severe-looking, angry trees invade any space left open by the 
sharp, jagged rocks.  Contorted, as if tortured by a Cruciatus Curse, the 
path painfully staggers northeast into a close thicket.

      <desc>With thick trunks and gnarled limbs, the trees huddle against each other, 
making passage between them impossible.  Their roots break and tear through 
the surrounding soil, covered in slithering shapes that might be ivy or 
snakes.  Any light that reaches the path is quickly smothered by the 
thicket, so that the forest of scarred, crooked trunks fades after a few 
inches into a dark curtain of ghostly shapes.  Entangled with each other 
till they are sometimes indistinguishable individually, the trees hiss and 
twist together in a permanent war dance.

    <desc>An everlasting war is fought here between the hungry, gnawing trees growing 
south and west, and the small paths struggling to reach eastward, northward, 
and to the southwest.  The trees form an impenetrable barrier as they twist 
protectively around each other, in a dark, dank wall of musty enmity.  A few 
old, gnarled, contorted roots dig forcefully into the base of teeth-like 
rocks that stand on either side of the lanes.  The tops of the jagged stones 
are cracked and overgrown with lichen and moss, their bases crumbling from 
the forceful attack of the nearby forest.  The dirty, vaguely-brown streak 
that is the road slopes downhill, with bushes overgrowing in the centre, as 
though more surely marking the more-trodden areas.  A sharp, acrid smell 
erupts in the warmer seasons from scattered blood-like, crimson flowers on 
these mid-path plants.  All around, the trees move ever closer, hunched over 
the path with their crowns uniting in a thicket that keeps all light away.

    <desc>The path here stumbles, twitches, and bends so much that it becomes nearly 
impossible to make out its direction; the dizzying streak of dust is most 
likely headed south and northeast, deep between walls of entangled trees.  
The road itself is not much more than a cracked lane, its dull-brown colour 
interrupted by patches of crouched, slimy-green, squelching plants.  The 
intertwined branches above form a nearly-impenetrable ceiling; growling with 
suppressed anger, the trees at either side of the road prevent any light 
from coming through.  A tense silence, only interrupted by the low, demonic 
voices of the forest itself, hangs around the very dust on the ground.  The 
trees are thick, dark, contorted, and gnarled beyond measure; their arms 
appear to be clawed and sharp, judging by the angry, deep scratches they 
left upon a few jagged rocks that flank the way.

      <desc>In the warmer seasons, but sometimes even during the winter, these low 
bushes are adorned with crimson flowers, always accompanied by short, 
stubby, poisonous-looking needles.  Their leaves are rounded towards the 
tips and appear to have the talent to always bend and twist such that their 
thorny underside surfaces.  Once in a while, the crimson flowers pop with a 
screeching squelch, releasing a mass of dense, sticky, pus-like substance 
that contains millions of tiny seeds.

    <desc>There is a sharp kink here in the road that leads southwest and southeast; 
it appears that a long time ago, an old path was swallowed and forced astray 
into a new lane by the twisted, malevolent trees around it.  An atmosphere 
of semi-dark mustiness hangs low in the air, charged with the anger of 
centuries-old, thick, growling trees.  Their branches grow in spirals around 
each other, supporting and entangling their neighbours into what appears to 
be a wall of bark and occasional leaves.  Above the lane, the thicket hangs 
suffocatingly-low, crowding the space with skeletal, coarse arms that block 
out all light.  The sunniest of days can only outline this chaotic, 
contorted, sharp barrier onto the path below.  Scarred by the anger of the

    <desc>The last remainder of a northwestern path descends and opens here in a dusty 
streak overgrown by bushes and wild shrubs.  Thickets of wild plants, tall, 
slender, and of a sickly-brown colour, spread alongside a very high 
northeastern hedge covered in slimy ivy and sharp thorns.  Instead of 
flowers, the garden is covered in season by twigs, branches, and entangling, 
musty, dark-green plants that squelch out a pus-like substance.  The cottage 
to the west is nearly invisible between the last remainders of a 
suffocating, dark forest.  Gnarled branches at least a hundred years old 
embrace the walls of the ruined house; their snake-like, leafless fingers 
whip out sharply and viciously at intruders.  The trees are huddled close to 
each other, forming a chaotic web tainted with scars of old age and frowns 
of fury.  The road that stumbles to the old, crumbling doorway is no more 
than a naked patch of earth, nearly overgrown by dark-brown plants that 
smell of musty loneliness and heavy buried anger.

      <desc>. The house is no larger than a shack; shabby windows with ivy slithering 
around them stand on the northern side, grime-strewn and opaque.  A single, 
wooden step leads up to the scarred, old door.  The entrance is made of oak, 
but even this durable material is ripped, torn, and withered everywhere.  A 
deep cut, probably made by a sharp knife, is visible about three feet up the 
wooden surface.  Above the cottage hang the low, menacing, spiralling arms 
of the forest; their all-powerful arms lovingly caress the house, but keep 
any light out.

      <desc>The hedge is tall and thick, covered with slimy, grey ivy.  The plant looks 
more like a scaly lizard than like its Muggle equivalent; the vines slash 
and whip the air as they move.  The tall wall of dark-green branches and 
twigs supporting the ivy is thinned out around its middle section, three 
feet from the ground.  The shrubs around it nearly cover the tiny opening; a 
more careful look reveals, however, that it opens up to a distant village 
road.  Other than this tiny flaw, the hedge is impenetrable, and passage 
through or over it is impossible.

    <desc>This filthy room resembles a dwelling-place only in the most superficial of 
ways.  Lit only by the murky light that filters through the gaps in the 
tiled roof, this combined kitchen and living area is in appalling condition. 
 The slate floor is so thickly coated in grime that it is impossible to tell 
if the uneven places are a feature of the stonework or a result of the 
accumulated muck.  The stone walls, though still stable, have seen better 
days.  Chunks of mortar are missing; a few gaps are large enough to poke a 
fist through.  Tiny, square openings are obviously intended as windows, but 
the empty frames reveal nothing but tangled vines.  A larger, rectangular 
opening to the east holds a moss-covered, but still sturdy, wooden door.  
The remains of an old wood stove and the wreck of an armchair are the only 
tangible remains of the few comforts this room once displayed.  A heap of 
accumulated debris clutters the north-western corner of the room.

    <desc>A cold, lethargic, stone pathway winds up the hill; its sides are enclosed 
by a thick border of concrete.  Unlike the dirt path that stretches 
southeast, this road is carefully kept in a straight line.  Small, iron 
fences deeply bite in the surrounding soil, keeping away any restless weeds. 
 Time has done little to erode this little-travelled way; it rises steadily 
against the steep slope in a level, clean road, built in condescending 
contrast to the main village lane.  With no smooth corners to alleviate the 
brisk angles in an eastern bend, the drive abruptly ends before the Ground 
Keeper's House.  Farther northwest, at the end of the pathway and on the 
hunched forehead of the wrinkled hill, stands a scarred, sinister, desolate 
manor.

    <desc>This cramped cottage shows signs of long abandonment.  Gritty, grey dust 
covers every surface, muting every colour and blunting every corner.  An 
antiquated gas range sits next to a door on the western wall; a filthy 
window facing the same direction affords a smeared glimpse of a manor house 
to the northwest.  Chipped and grubby formica counters surround a tiny sink. 
 An elderly table and a rickety chair fill the centre of the space, resting 
on the battered linoleum, dark with the grime of years.  A door to the east 
boasts a small, inset window.  Tattered shreds of what were once curtains 
adhere to the accumulated grunge.

    <desc>An unobstructed, stone pathway stumbles as though in horror before what 
appears to be the mutilated form of a broken, lonely manor standing to the 
northwest atop this scarred hill.  The road is level, with a border of 
concrete at either side; fences keep away any overenthusiastic weeds.  
Perfect to the smallest detail and little-worn, the path cannot hope to 
erase the impression of the naked desolation of what appears to have once 
been the leading house in this village.  To the southeast crashes a harsh 
slope, at the foot of which lies Little Hangleton, with small rooftops and 
bright windows peeking from beneath willow and oak branches.  A discoloured, 
thin gate stands to the northeast, overriden with wild vegetation and thick 
trees.  On a hillock in the far, southeastern distance, the mournful form of 
an old, gaunt, hollow church appears ready to crumble.  Strangled between 
overgrown bushes and old ivy, an old side-branch of the drive runs 
southwest.

      <desc>The large manor is completely overrun by wild ivy.  Thick, gnarled oaks 
close in against its walls, drawing even the slightest hint of life from the 
suffocated building.  The windows are boarded up, although the wood is 
beginning to crumble away.  A large branch appears to have crashed against 
the roof; it balances atop the high manor ready to fall on an old bit of 
ragged carpet which might once have been a welcome mat.  The front door is 
made of heavy wood, the black paint on which is scarred in violent, 
irregular, patternless streaks, etched by whipping rain and malevolent 
animals.  A round doorknob made of sterling silver echoes former wealth; by 
contrast, the surrounding wood is splintered and carved inwards until it is 
reduced to a thin sheet separating the inside of Riddle Manor from the 
outside.

softly rustling and swaying in a graceful, whispering, everlasting dance.  
In the warmer seasons, white, yellow, and mauve flowers litter the grounds, 
some bunched together in shrubs and bushes, others scattered amidst the 
surrounding mass of green.  The path is slightly uneven, running in the 
shadow of two hills, one to the northwest and the second, to the southeast.  
A few linden trees grow in the northern distance, shading the surroundings 
with calm, generous arms.  To the south stands the village pub; a sign above 
it reads 'The Hanged Man'.  Quickley Lane moves east further towards the

Its walls have the matte-beige hue of sandstone; a crimson-tile roof covers the squat, rounded tower, barely visible beyond heavy boughs in golden and deep-green tinges. The door is the deepest azure, but with a rather coarse-looking lock, probably the heritage of the old Mill. A large, round, polished silver knocker hangs two thirds up its sturdy, wooden surface.

    <desc>A garden of shrubs and twisting, elegant ivy stretches on the southern side 
of the road, bordered by a three-foot tall, brown picket fence.  Through the 
gaps between the vertical, wooden bars explode branches of wild bushes, 
curling around any solid object they encounter.  A gate, nearly overrun by 
low bushes and dextrous, leafy ivy, permits limited access inside.  The road 
passes east and west, parallel to the fence; to the northeast and northwest 
stretches an infinite, swaying mass of fresh grass.  In season, nestled 
between the slender blades are white and mauve flowers with delicate, soft 
petals, shaded by a few oaks.  Cradled on all sides by vegetation is a 
northern shop, having the peculiar shape of a fluffy, yawning, Persian cat.  
Hanging down its right ear is a board reading, &quot;Feather's Fluffies&quot;.  In the 
southeastern distance, inaccessible but close, rises a single, desolate 
hill, crowned with the hunched, empty ruins of an abandoned church.

      <desc>The southeastern hill is moderately high. It slopes gently for the first few feet; after that, the hillside becomes steep. A dismal, sad cemetery is visible in the distance, with a mutilated angel rising like a Doom-Bringer upon a headstone. At the very peak of the hill stands a broken, smoke-stained, crumbling church. With its cross lopsided and its doors visibly twisted away, the aching building looks like a hobbling, broken being ready to utter its death cry.

    <desc>The picket fence bordering this garden is nearly concealed behind 
wildly-branching shrubs and a matted sheet of ivy.  The gate to the north is 
crowded by a chaotic, waist high bush with red-tipped leaves, and gripped by 
tenacious vines; access is possible, but not easy.  A pathway, bordered by 
clay tiles and under siege by unpruned hedges, wends its way southwest to a

    <desc>The floor of this sparsely-lit inn lies several feet below ground level, 
firmly nestling the snug pub into the earth.  Soft shadows wrap themselves 
like safe, secret blankets around every corner and nook.  The well-used bar 
is comprised of a single, solid cut of walnut, still with the lacquered bark 
at the edge.  Every surface in the room bears the lustrous patina of 
rubbed-in years of sweat and alcohol.  Several dark, stained tables and 
crimson, leather-covered stools stand in the little light trickling in from 
the misty windows.  Small, brass candelabras assist in illuminating the 
thick, glass liquor bottles along the back wall.  Muggles come and go 
through the northern door, leading to Quickley Lane, oblivious to the tight, 
winding stairwell leading to a hatch in the ceiling.  A set of double doors 
to the east leads out to the modest garden.

    <desc>This somewhat-cluttered room is a compact amalgam of kitchen and sitting 
area.  The floor, constructed of broad planks of knotty pine, is scattered 
with small, oval rag-rugs.  The ceiling consists of exposed rafters and more 
of the pine planks; it almost mirrors the floor.  The cooking area is 
unsophisticated; butcher-block counters, an enamelled sink and a two-burner 
range occupy the southern side of the room.  The door on the northeast wall 
is accessible, but reaching it involves weaving through a jumble of 
comfortable furnishings.  The windows offer a view of the garden, a jungle 
of tangled bushes and ropes of ivy.  There are curtains, but the blue, 
gingham fabric is limp and slightly grungy.  A candle in a battered 
candlestick provides dim illumination when natural light wanes.

    <desc>Quickley Lane runs east and west of this point, its dusty surface mostly 
even and straight.  The cappuccino-brown streak of earth melts to the north 
into the fresh green of a sea of grass, littered in season with white and 
pink flowers.  Some low bushes make their way through the swaying, tender 
blades; the shrubs have perennial, small, and intense-crimson flowers.  To 
the south climbs a thin, pale path that leads to the peak of the hill, 
through a hauntingly-desolate, lugubrious graveyard; at the very top hunches 
a ruined and hollow church.  The sinister shape of a mutilated angel guards 
one of the largest tombstones; even from the distance, the statue appears a 
bringer of doom, rather than of salvation.

    <desc>The pale road stretching here is thin and overrun by weeds in sickly-brown 
and yellowing tinges.  The way winds up the slope of a desolate hill, 
tossing and turning at every step as though sleepless and tormented.  
Fragments of rock lie scattered and buried in green moss across the path's 
dirty-grey surface; on either side grow entangled shrubs, ivy, and low, 
contorted trees.  Any light is dimmed and tainted as dark, naked branches 
braid themselves above the streak of dirt.  Crisscrossing scars, bleeding 
the green of old, vengeful ivy vines, are etched deeply within their bark.  
To the north, the way stumbles like a drunken man into a large and friendly 
country lane, bordered by a widespread, green meadow.  To the southeast, the 
path climbs on towards a dishevelled, abandoned, hollow graveyard.

    <desc>Breathless, nearly strangled by layers upon layers of wiry, sharp ivy, a 
path stumbles determinedly up a steep slope; it is but a mere streak of grey 
upon a damp, musky mixture of sickly-brown, pus-yellow, and moss-green.  Ivy 
slithers against the path, old and as strong and vicious as barbed wire.  On 
either side of the way crouch ancient, twisted oaks, their bark burnt and 
scarred with time.  Wild and bent as though under the strain of a heavy 
burden, their branches are entangled with each other above the wretched 
road, rejecting and tainting any bit of light that reaches this place.  To 
the east stretches a dismal road through an abandoned, haunting, desolate 
graveyard; the very silence in it is screaming with pain.  To the northwest, 
the path stumbles and falls down the hill, crashing into a peaceful, wide 
road.

Scars, barely hidden by overgrown ivy, dig deeply into their bark, as though some wild, maniacal animal used them as scratching-posts. Their trunks are twisted and contorted, sometimes into half-hitches, and their arms are savagely webbed over the path.

    <desc>Pitched on a steep incline, the grassy path leading from Halcyon Avenue to 
the old church has long succumbed to overgrown bramble bushes and thick, 
rubbery weeds.  As the trail winds southeast, beset by grey slabs of stone, 
it darkens beneath the looming, shadowy, broken spire.  Dominating the scene 
is an imposing marble headstone marking the resting place of &quot;TOM RIDDLE&quot;.  
Further off, amidst the crypts and crumbling tombstones, a towering, 
sculpted angel with one shattered wing stands atop a grave, shrouded in ivy 
and moss.  A rusted iron gate leads westward to the village.

    <desc>The wild, unkempt, graveyard trail curls steeply southwards towards the 
decrepit church.  Beneath a large, gnarled yew tree standing nearby, the 
gritted path turns to glutinous, wet mud.  Dismal, stone tombs lie to either 
side, extending to the wooded borders of the stark, sepulchral churchyard.  
Regardless the hour, a seasonless, icy mist envelops the cold soil, clinging 
to the earth like a disquieted spirit.  A thin, iron fence can be seen 
further down the path to the northwest.  The silhouette of a titanic, 
abandoned house stands atop a hill in the distance.

    <desc>Between the collapsed, stone archway of the church entrance to the west and 
the gloomy graveyard pitching away to the north, this dark and desolate 
hilltop lies bare to the elements.  Far below, away from the screaming 
winds, the tiny houses of Little Hangleton closely huddle together against 
the chill.  Cast in permanent shadow, no vegetation survives in the 
frozen-hard earth below the crumbling, sacrosanct monolith.  Though devoid 
of the dead, the very air is pregnant with lost love, demise, and ceaseless 
ache.

The church atop Chapel Hill remains as little more than a ruined bulk of masonry, wounded and broken. The slate-grey spire still pierces the sky, though with gaping, skeletal holes ripped along one side. Long abandoned, a web of dead ivy seems to hold the edifice together.

and blackened, contorted above the cracked stone steps.  Any light sifting 
through the forcibly open entrance reaches no farther than a few inches 
inside; the entire building is otherwise tainted in the frozen stillness and 
haunting darkness of death.  Walls appearing moments away from crumbling 
support a scarred, burnt archway.  In the very centre, an old bell is half 
sunken in the foundation of the abandoned sanctuary, its buried voice 
silenced forever.  Around it are scattered splinters of the twenty or so 
benches.  Wooden beams are crushed against the floor.  Two of these, crossed 
in a strange and tainted makeshift crucifix, scar the mass table; the wood 
creaks beneath it with silent tears of pain.  The organ is cleanly broken in 
two, the halves kept apart by a heavy, oak balk.  Beneath a lonely 
stain-glass window, sharp, crude, rusted nails crucify the carved images of 
four church patrons.

      <desc>The archway is made of old oak, scarred by burns and by what appear to be 
the claws an overenthusiastic, malevolent, slashing tree.  In the damp, 
decayed fragments where it meets the floor, the oak is smothered by the 
snake-like vines of grey ivy and sickly-green moss.  Half of the archway is 
broken; the beams hang, shredded like the mocking imitation of an Oriental 
curtain.  A forgotten rosary is caught on the large head of a nasty nail, 
threatening to fall at any time.

      <desc>The window, now framed in broken pieces of carved wood, looks upon the broken sanctuary with the eyes of the resurrected Christ. Years of grime, dust, and dirt are threatening to cover this last source of light, as shabby and as useless as it might be. Outside, tears relentlessly fall on the sad, patient face of Jesus. His eyes are frozen in a deathly stare upon the fallen bell; any shine and comfort that might once have been drawn into that gaze are now turned in agony and grief.

    <desc>Heavy, lavish, golden velvet curtains haphazardly heap on the dusty ledges 
of the three eastern mullioned windows.  Cobwebs crawl all over the 
once-fine cloth and cling to the grime-coated glass with desperate, hungry, 
possessive, painfully-delicate strands.  The ceiling shows traces of having 
once been painted white; intricate carving depicts an angular, geometric 
pattern on which dust clings shamelessly in a layer at least an inch thick.  
A worn, dusty, lightless chandelier hangs like a menace above the centre of 
the room, echoing the cold splendour it once had.  Beneath it, a wooden 
table is collapsing under its own weight, mould having eaten away at its 
once-handsome legs.  To the west, southwest, north, south, and southeast are 
wooden doors, mercifully still left whole, although covered in thick grime.  
In the northeastern corner of the room, a stone staircase, its steps rounded 
by intense wear, clambers upward as though moaning under the immense weight 
of dust and dirt covering it.

    <desc>Even in its best days, this drawing room was not meant to appear warm and 
welcoming; everything in it was designed to impress by sheer value and 
magnitude.  A formerly-grand, grated fireplace, now ash-filled and 
smoke-stained, stands against the northern wall; atop the mantelpiece is a 
large, Venetian mirror, its designs hidden beneath a thick layer of grime.  
The ceiling is dark-grey, with a single, deadly-still candelabrum dangling 
down a rusted chain.  Against the western wall stand large, mullioned 
windows; on their sills rest heaps of thick, crimson, velvet curtains.  
Fragments of a wooden beam, rotted to fine dust, lie scattered across the 
fine, rich material.  Across the mahogany floor are sumptuous, Persian rugs 
blackened by years' worth of grime and soot.  Two leather sofas rest at 
opposite ends, marred by thick wounds bleeding grey dust.  A coffee table 
stands beside the westernmost sofa, mouldy and desolate in the echoing 
silence.  To the east and south are mahogany doors.

      <desc>The fireplace is large and squared, its corners made more abrupt by the 
angular, angry stripes of blackened soot against its white surface.  Steel 
grates once kept the warmth of the flames locked away from the chamber; now 
they are useless in keeping the sombre chill of surreal death locked behind 
them.  A few logs lie piled on the bottom of the hearth, forgotten, chipped, 
and half-burnt.  Above the mantelpiece rests a large, intricately-engraved 
Venetian mirror, a large crack running like a deep, deadly wound against its 
perfect surface.  Grime, dirt, and age-old ashes cover it beneath a thick, 
heavy blanket.

    <desc>The copper pots and pans, hanging from the hooks across the immense kitchen, 
look as if they've been polished with grunge and corrosion.  A mammoth, cast 
iron Aga leans against one wall.  Stout wooden tables are well-worn from the 
years of pans being banged on them, knives cutting a miscellany of food 
stuffs, meats being pounded, it being scrubbed and cleaned regularly by the 
servants who would now cry at the complete dilapidation the kitchen is in.  
A dolly press, its wood now inhabited by mold, stands in a corner adjacent 
to the single window that allows a semblance of light to filter through.  
That is, if the lambency can fight its way through the array of ivy and 
other plants blocking its view and the soiled condition from the years of 
neglect.  Above the northern door is a series of small black bells.  Most of 
the ropes once attached to these bells are moth-eaten, mildewed, and frayed. 
 The exit to the west leads to the Dining Hall, while the shabby, oak door 
to the south leads outside.

    <desc>Due to the mahogany panelling and lack of windows, the only light that ever 
reaches this landing trickles from the master bedroom to the north, the 
bedroom to the south, the study to the west, or sneaks up the stairs.  An 
indigo runner, covering the grey slate floor, once boasted of golden threads 
spun in intricate detail along each of its sides.  Now, however, the 
elements have emblazoned this carpet with multitudinous shades of grime and 
muck.  Lining the walls is a smorgasbord of portraits with obvious lineage.  
Lamps, fashioned from brushed gold, dangle in this hall in various states of 
disrepair.

this passage is as dark and damp as a cave.  Begrimed, golden globes, that 
once housed bulbs of light, are now shattered or hanging cockeyed upon the 
windowless, mahogany panelled walls.  Upon the grey slate floor is an indigo 
carpet dressed with gold embroidery along its sides, as well as dirt, holes, 
and discolouration.  Riddle family portraits are hung upon the walls, their 
dark visages barely discernable; dozens of eyes peering into this shadowy

is soggy and sagging from the water dripping from the unprotected rooftop.  
Embracing the bed is a covering of silver fox.  However, the fur is now 
matted, discoloured, and peppered with holes.  The cherry wood comprising 
the bed is cohorts with the cherry wardrobe holding once stylish, expensive 
clothing.  A mirror, from floor to ceiling and corner to corner, embraces 
the southern wall, a testament to the vanity of a previous owner.  A soiled, 
dank, bear skin rug lies in front of the red slate fireplace.  Four lavish, 
scarlet armchairs grace each corner of the room, allowing seating for dust 
and vermin only.  The landing lies through the northern door.

mire.  Small oval windows, located high on the northern and eastern walls, 
permit the possibility of light trickling in from outside.  The sturdy bed, 
with matching armoire, sports a plush, amaranthine velvet cover, but this 
duvet has seen better days.  Moth holes and a sludge-like substance have 
hijacked this blanket as well as the wine-coloured rug upon the blue, slate 
floor.  Pink slate fashions the fireplace standing next to what was once a 
butter cream-coloured armchair.  The polluted, ripped seat allows stuffing 
to emerge and springs to wiggle their way out.  A few portraits of a young 
man with black hair hang from the wall.  Through the southern door lies the

    <desc>The mahogany door to the south has a single, diamond-shaped carving two 
thirds up its surface; otherwise, it, like anything else in this chamber is 
simple and indiscriminately covered in mould, dust, and a dank stench of 
hollow death.  A reddish-brown, mahogany dresser stands against the eastern 
wall; a simple, rectangular mirror sits atop it.  It would be a beautiful 
piece of furniture were it not for the incredible amount of dust and mould 
clinging to it.  Steady cracks run across the mirror, dirt forming 
inch-thick scars upon them.  An old candelabrum dangles heavily from the 
ceiling, its weight augmented by a merciless layer of dust and heavy 
oxidation.  Cobwebs dangle intricately across its surface; obviously, 
insects have stopped worrying about the lights being turned on.  A squared 
window breaks the monotony of the mouldy, panelled walls; its frame is 
beginning to disintegrate, the glass is so covered with grime it looks 
matte-grey.  Along the eastern wall stands an oaken bed.

    <desc>The white slate floors, displaying a stratum of silt, now bear a resemblance 
to lead.  A behemoth, mahogany table, seating twenty-four, slices this room 
in half.  The high backs of these chairs, seated around this filmy slab of 
lumber, are inlaid with a golden spiral clutching a ruby at its axis.  A 
patina swathes the dinnerware and a scuzzy, glutinous substance is nestled 
in the multifarious serving dishes.  A bronze chandelier stretches its arms

Large Palladian windows have gaping holes with shattered glass under their

    <desc>The trees clamber here close to one another; they form a clustering dead end 
that crushes and smothers the remainder of a western path.  Thick, gnarled, 
malevolent branches dig with whipping slashes into the few jagged rocks that 
stand around a crooked splash of brown - the lane.  Slithering hungrily 
between the rocks are slimy, serpent-like vines of grey ivy, wrapped in 
thick and heavy coils.  The soil, ruffled and cut by dozens of angry roots, 
bursts into dark-green, slimy, boil-like plants with crimson flowers.  
Instead of reaching up, the small bushes huddle in low crouches from which 
porcupine-like needles erupt in all directions.  Eastward, the thicket of 
trees is thinning, just enough to see a small glimpse of a wooden shack.  
The way, however, is completely blocked; crisscrossing, infinite spirals of 
branches, trunks, and leaves form an impenetrable barrier.

      <desc>Great rocks, sharp as an ancient monster's fossilized teeth, rise all around the ends of this dirt path. Smaller slabs are scattered all around; it is not clear whether they were broken off the larger stones or just forgotten there by the capricious passage of time. Across their surfaces stretch lichen and moss, embracing the jagged surfaces with the persistence and fierceness of a passionate lover.

    <desc>This simple, but comfortable room holds a quaint, functional kitchen at the 
north end and a cosy sitting area towards the south.  The floor consists of 
broad planks of knotty oak, rippled and satin-soft from years of scrubbing.  
Bright, braided rugs are scattered haphazardly about the space.  A bristly 
mat sits just inside the wooden door in the west wall.  Plastered in warm 
white, the walls embrace diminutive, multi-paned, casement windows; the deep 
windowsills are framed in oak planks and cluttered with objects.  The south 
wall holds a fieldstone fireplace with a broad, slate hearth.  Candles of 
all shapes and sizes perch about the room in a variety of makeshift 
candlesticks, supplementing any sunlight.

area.  A seasoned, iron kettle sits on one burner, and a cast-iron frying 
pan hangs from a nearby hook.  An oak plank, thick as a man's arm, is 
mounted above the range to serve as a shelf.  A lidded, iron cooking pot 
sits there, along with copper sauce pots and a collection of glass bowls.  
An oak keg sits on cradles in one corner, an earthenware jug on the floor 
beneath the tap.  Broad and welcoming, a plain, sturdy table occupies most 
of the floor space; matching chairs with colourful, patchwork cushions 
surround it.  A row of toby jugs line the back of the counter next to the 
enamel sink.

    <desc>The wide open space of the meeting room is dominated by a crescent 
moon-shaped table.  Twelve seats surround the outer arc, focusing attention 
on a central void.  The dark, oak-panelled walls are home to several 
bookshelves, all stuffed to bursting.  Hanging brass lanterns, aided by a 
few floating candles, light the room in an ambient, warm glow.  Set into the 
southern wall is a huge brass fireplace.  The mantle, a thick, wooden beam, 
is home to an array of heavy stone pots and glass jars.  Beneath a hatch in 
the floor, a single descending staircase leads down to the pub below.

    <desc>A large fireplace with a grey marble surround dominates the western wall.  
Polished oak flooring is covered by richly-pigmented rugs in the Persian 
style.  An eclectic assortment of high-quality chairs and small tables is 
gathered here.  Glowing globes float about, hovering at head-height to 
provide adequate illumination.  Exaggerated shadows nod and dance as the 
lights drift and bob.  The panelled walls are decorated with 'bas-relief 
carvings of wizarding impressions of village life.  The air in this 
windowless space is stale; the only visible means of ventilation is the door 
on the northern wall.

    <desc>The country lane turns here in a smooth, rounded bend, heading west and 
northeast.  On the inside of the curve to the northwest, stands a solitary, 
great oak.  Its powerful, old branches are wrinkled and knobbly; running 
down its large trunk are scars appearing to have belonged to a tall, savage 
animal.  The tree generally gives its shade to the infinitely-spreading 
grass around and below it.  In the warmer part of the year, the mass of 
green is littered with pink, scarlet, yellow, and white buds.  To the 
southeast, the path stumbles before the entrance to a cosy-looking, grey 
house.  The vague marks of a crucifix indicate that this building might once 
have belonged to a vicarage; instead of the cross now hangs a small, golden 
plaque.  The words 'Faded Fables' are written in cursive white upon a wooden 
sign, just above the oak, front door.

    <desc>A peaceful, country lane trickles north and southwest, bordered on the 
western side by cheerful grass and scattered, heavy oaks.  Its even, clear 
surface is the colour of cappuccino; occasional, white petals from a few 
nearby seasonal flowers serve as foam.  The bend is smooth to the west, 
bordered by tall blades of swaying grass, littered in the warmer part of the 
year with white blossoms.  To the east, the dirt path slowly changes into a 
stone street; a small, rectangular sign to the south labels it as 'Green 
Street'.  Around the thin steel pole supporting the sign grow austere hedges 
and carefully-mowed grass.  Cleared of buildings and shaded by the boughs of 
a few enclosed trees, the village square stretches northeast.  Its pavement 
is occasionally chipped and worn down by persistent English rains and busy 
footsteps.

    <desc>A thick oak, gnarled and twisted by wind and old age, bows over the 
beautiful country lane here.  Its branches are heavy and knobbly, gently 
reaching out to embrace the surrounding air.  On sunny days, the swaying 
arms of the old tree stretch on the light-brown, smooth path like elegant, 
spidery Chinese designs.  The road is clean and well-trodden for the most 
part, occasionally streaked with rows of polished white pebbles; they light 
up in golden nimbuses every time the slightest hint of sunshine reaches 
them.  The path spreads north and south, always bordered by shrubs, hedges, 
and tall grass on the western side.  To the east and to the northeast 
spreads the village square; made of grey stone, the open area has tiny 
enclosures around a few trees.  Flessy's Fortunes lies through the bloodwood 
door to the west.

    <desc>In the far, southwestern distance, crowning a large hill, stands an 
impressive, but desolate, cold, wretched manor.  An equally-gaunt, 
hauntingly-hollow building that might once have been a church presides over 
a dark, tainted cemetery in the distant south.  By contrast, the square 
spreading east and southeast is peaceful, embedded with the sedate, calm 
pace of British village life.  Occasional trees are planted within earth 
enclosures in the grey pavement.  The lane that passes through here, heading 
north and south, is made of a cappuccino-shaded soil, well trodden and 
hardened by many trampling feet.  To the west, the dirt path smoothly gives 
in to a border of soft grass.  Shrubs of all sorts, seasonally streaked with 
garlands of crimson flowers, stretch across the fresher green of the blades.

      <desc>The leaves of these shrubs finish in sharp, laced ends as they cover the many thin twigs, as though ashamed of their brown nakedness. The ends of the little branches explode in spring into inflorescences of twenty or so crimson flowers. Their petals are soft, candidly spreading outward to face the infinite heavens above.

    <desc>Behind an impassable, polished, eastern, iron fence stands a large, rather 
sumptuous-looking building, possibly the Town Hall; its southern entrance 
opens towards the Village Square.  In clusters, at the foot of each bar, 
grow, in season, timid, vulnerable flowers, their hues ranging from the 
deepest blush-pink to dazzling-white.  They erupt in patches into the lane 
that passes through here, heading north and south.  The path itself is old 
and well-trodden, paler-brown and more even in its centre streaks, and 
darker and bumpy at the edges, where it kisses explosions of grass and 
shrubs.  Amidst the fresh, green sea of grass to the southwest grow 
occasional trees and seasonal flowers; a particularly thick, inaccessible 
group of oaks stands directly to the west, with a small opening to the 
northwest.  The air is thick with waves of sweet scents.

    <desc>The pathway coming from the south opens up here in a funnel.  Streaks of 
stones and pebbles form tiny, arched rays that litter the opening like the 
different courses of a river in a delta.  Thick, oak branches are 
intertwined like a webbed gate above this outstretched, cappuccino-brown 
way; the trees are old and knobbly, growing at the very edge of the road 
amidst patches of grass and bushes.  Although far from wide, or thick enough 
to plunge this part of Quickley Lane into complete darkness, the trees 
provide a generous and comfortable measure of shade.  In the warmer seasons, 
the few, gnarled roots that emerge from the ground are buried amidst the 
soft petals of red, blue, and white flowers.  Dark-green bushes kiss the 
edges of the lane; during spring and summer they burst in crimson blossoms 
resembling drops of innocent blood.

      <desc>The two trees are old and thick; their bark bears long scars, made by the fury of nature and by the enthusiastic hands of young children. It appears that writing initials is one of the favourite pastimes of the younger generation in this village; nearly every letter of the alphabet is carved into the aging trunks. Above the road stands an archway of webbed branches, rustling slowly with even the mildest of breezes.

    <desc>A wide street stretches westward, smoothly turning into a handsome dirt path 
as it runs to the east.  The cobblestones are old and rounded at the edges, 
the occasional footprint embedded in their surface by insistent treading.  
Small, timid, fresh-green blades of grass peek from between them, sometimes 
accompanied in season by tiny flowers in tinges ranging from mauve to 
deep-scarlet.  The path broadens north and northeast into the Village 
Square; the pavement is there shaded by tall trees planted within small 
enclosures.  On the northern side of the Square rises the impressive, 
sumptuous Town Hall; to the far northeast is an impressive-looking manor 
exuding a strict air of good-taste, severity, and considerable wealth.  To 
the south, Green Street narrows into a foot-wide lane crossing through a 
cheerful garden towards a bright, white-painted house.

      <desc>This garden is enclosed by a low picket fence and a two-foot tall gate. A small lane parts two patches of well-tended grass, littered with occasional, dark-green bushes. Two tall, rich oaks rise on either side of the path; their generous, low boughs shed an ever-swaying, shape-changing shade on the lawn below. In the warmer part of the year, flowers snake and twist around the surrounding blades of grass, brightening the sweet-scented atmosphere with their crimson, scarlet, mauve, and white tinges.

    <desc>A clean, cheerful street ambles through here, heading east and west.  To the 
south stretches a small mansion preceded by a lovely garden; on both sides 
of its tall, iron gate stand old, thick, knobbly linden trees, planted in 
small, earthy enclosures.  A sturdy, polished-iron fence with bars buried 
deeply underground surrounds each of the swaying, sighing trees.  Grass and 
seasonal flowers raise their tiny, white, scarlet, or mauve heads from 
between rounded, well-trodden cobblestones; heavy, linden branches hang low 
above some of these blossoms, while others rejoice in the open heavens 
above.  To the north and northwest spreads the shaded Village Square, 
bordered by the Town Hall and by a large, severe manor.

      <desc>The garden is magnificent, beaming brightly in hues of cerulean-blue, crimson, and dazzling-white. Bushes and shrubs, tenderly wrapped around each other, are simply overrun in the warmer part of the year by rich inflorescences of soft, wide, arched petals. Rising above the flowers are thick, old oaks spreading their arms widely to protect and shade the tender blades of grass surrounding them.

    <desc>The lovely Green Street turns west and northeast here; the bend is smooth 
and curved, a single, low oak bowing low above it.  Its bark is scarred by 
time and by enthusiastic children who carved their names on it.  Beyond the 
tree, to the northwest, spreads a large square, shaded by many trees and 
ending in an impressive, severe manor and in a tall, sumptuous building that 
might be the Town Hall.  Sliding away like mud from the clean, cobblestone 
street is a scarred, overrun path, suffocated in shrubs and weeds in various 
states of decay.  To the east, a small, overused, hard, dirt path leads 
through a sensible, well-mowed lawn to a small, but pretty house.  The air 
is thick with a mixture of dust and of tender freshness.

    <desc>This small living space smells of bacon, cabbage, and apples, the aroma so 
ingrained that it oozes from the very wallpaper.  The minute kitchen 
occupies the southwestern corner, with a heavy, free-standing, stone sink as 
the most prominent feature.  An eating area fills the centre of the room, 
and an open fireplace in the northeastern corner visually balances the 
kitchen.  The grain of the broad planks of the floor is prominent, defined 
by years of wear.  The muted colours of braided rag rugs provide brighter 
spots against the variegated brown of the wooden surface.  Ecru curtains, 
starched and ironed, frame the casement windows, each containing a 
half-dozen hand-sized panes of thick, wavy glass, held in place by dark, 
wooden muntins.  Candles drifting about the room, just above head-height, 
provide additional illumination when required.  A thick, sturdy oak door on 
the western wall, hung on hand-forged hinges, leads out into the street.

mishaps.  Scorched crescents hint at hot pots, and a long, arching spray of 
blackened marks suggests a lapse in proper wand-safety techniques at some 
point in the past.  One corner of the tabletop shows the unmistakable 
imprints of tiny teeth, apparently where a small child found relief from the 
discomfort of teething.  Wooden chairs with woven-rush backs complete the

    <desc>A cobblestone street continues here from the southwest, to end between three 
houses; the way is well-trodden, the stones are rounded at the edges, with 
vegetation creeping up from between them.  To the north rises a large house, 
very nearly a manor, styled in a comfortable, though not overly-lavish 
manner.  In front of it, the garden contains topiaries, tailored and 
carefully tweaked in the shapes of beautifully-robed witches and wizards of 
different ages; the figurines are all in talking to each other, smiling, or 
playing.  To the east, a small path leads through a garden of topiaries 
trimmed to resemble animals, towards a cottage smaller than the manor, but 
just as comfortable.  Occasional, puffy flowers, hued pink, scarlet, yellow, 
and blue, grow upon a southeastern lawn; beyond it stands a flat-roofed, 
relatively modern house.

What is slightly shocking, however, is that all these animals wear little jackets, or even overalls; the clothing looks rather well on them.

gleaming, black-and-red finish contrasting with the ivory, rose, and green 
of the sofa.  A wingback chair covered with slightly-worn, blush-pink velvet 
sits in conference with a diminutive table topped with dark-veined, green 
marble, polished to a high sheen.  Massive and yielding, an enormous 
armchair covered in buttery, chestnut leather completes the grouping.  The 
spindly walnut table beside it looks even less substantial by comparison.

      <desc>The stone fireplace surround has a soft, oily sheen, highlighting the 
striated slate, ranging in colour from dove to sooty grey.  An embroidered 
screen prevents any draft from entering the room when the fire is unlit: 
stitched figures of silken birds flutter between needlework vines on a pale 
blue background.  Atop the mahogany mantle sits a bewildering variety of 
curios, including tiny clockwork figures, a Grecian-style vase, and a brass 
clock with a startling number of hands.  A handsomely-faded Persian carpet 
lies in front of the hearth, slightly askew.

matching the shade.  An oak, roll-top desk stands next to the door on the 
south wall, a trio of pewter candlesticks clustered atop it.

    <desc>This snug cottage is well-lit, both by large, multi-paned windows and by a 
number of graceful oil lamps.  The blonde wood floor is smooth and glossy, 
though a bit of dog hair does linger in the corners.  Sheer curtains of 
fine, white cotton frame the windows, including the tiny one in the western 
door.  The furniture is all comfortable and newly-upholstered.  Located in 
the northwest corner, the fireplace is constructed of polished stone and 
trimmed in carved mahogany.  Wallpaper in a subdued Swiss dot pattern is 
nearly invisible; the walls are covered in framed photographs.  A grouping 
of waist-high statuary occupies the southern end of the room.

wall space.  Each photo shows a rather bewildered-looking animal in 
beautifully-tailored clothing.  A horse stares back at the trousers cinched 
around its middle, ears twitching in confusion.  A dog scampers madly in 
endless circles, attempting to catch hold of its frilly skirt.  A cat, 
flat-eared and hissing, stares disgustedly out at the world, its expression 
daring the viewer to comment on its charming frock coat.

    <desc>This snug room is apparently in the midst of a slow alteration in decor.  
The faded wallpaper, the worn, painted, wooden floor, and the old-fashioned 
casement windows match well the good-quality, but aging, wooden table and 
the well-used, but clean and functional, range in the kitchen area on the 
west side of the room.  Other details seem incongruous.  In the southeastern 
corner, two chairs sit near the fireplace.  One is a shapeless, worn, and 
made of faded leather.  The other is a highly-polished wingback, upholstered 
in garish brocade.  On the floor, in front of the unpretentious fireplace, 
is a faux-Persian rug in glaring reds and harsh yellows.  Gaudy oil lamps 
with Tiffany shades are placed on random surfaces.  The door, in the 
northwest wall, has recently had changes in hardware: a costly, 
brass-and-glass doorknob and a gleaming kickplate provide a sharp contrast 
to the black iron hinges and the worn lintel.  A mahogany bookshelf next to 
the door holds a matching set of leather-bound books, their uncreased spines 
lettered in gold.

      <desc>The mastermind behind the reinvention of this home's style has already 
visited the kitchen.  The scuffed, enamel sink bears gleaming, new, brass 
taps, and the bottle of dish-soap has been replaced by a square, 
cobalt-blue, glass bottle fitted with a curved, chrome top.  The dishes in 
the cupboards all match, displaying a busy pattern of butterflies, all 
flapping improbably-multicoloured wings in dizzying chaos.  At the back of 
one shelf, nearly concealed behind a teapot apparently intended as an 
inventory of the order Lepidoptera, is a slightly-chipped, pale-blue tea 
mug; perhaps it is a favorite, rescued from the sweeping tide of change.

    <desc>This stretch of grey, herringbone-cobbled ground forms the southeast corner 
of the village square.  A green-painted bench sits here, alongside a 
spreading oak tree growing in a small, fenced enclosure.  To the east is a 
quaint storefront, the plate-glass window stenciled with the words 'Lund's 
Market'.  To the north, beyond the remainder of the square, hunkers the town 
hall, and, to the northeast, a severe manor house.  On the far west, past 
the paved area, runs a path; it intersects with Green Street, which borders 
the south of the square.  A row of homes sits companionably across the 
southern street, windows arrayed towards the square.

wide-reaching branches shade the pavement beneath, even in those seasons 
where the tree is leafless.  A park bench, painted a soft green, is 
positioned to take advantage of the oak's sheltering canopy.  On the 
latticework surrounding the tree is pinned a scrawled sign on notebook 
paper.  'Do Not Feed The Tree', it reads.

home to an oak tree, growing in a gap in the pavement.  Cobblestones form a 
grey, herringbone pattern that stretches from a path bordering the west side 
to Green Street running along the south edge.  Across the square, to the 
east, a few shops are visible, and the imposing shape of the town hall 
dominates the north.  All of the surfaces here show the passage of time in 
blunted corners and rounded edges; the square has an air of comfortable 
familiarity and well-worn hospitality.

hands.  Sitting just above the top fence-rail, the worn bark has a

store.  The northern side is evidently designated for edibles, ranging from 
dusty bins of potatoes to lurid packets of sweets.  The southern half of the 
store is a repository for all sorts of other items; fishhooks, copper pots, 
motor oil, and screwdrivers are all here, along with many other items of an 
equally random nature, placed according to some unfathomable organizational 
system.  The back of the shop is given over to a long counter and an ornate 
cash register.  Flickering electric lights join forces with any natural 
light streaming through the plate-glass window which flanks the wooden door 
in the western wall.  Despite the general impression of disarray, the shop 
is remarkably dust-free; from the tiled floor to the expanse of store-front 
glass, everything is well-scrubbed.

polished, oak flooring is softened by a large, soft rug in faded-denim blue, 
cream, and dove-grey.  The colours blend with the azure bed curtains and 
pearl coverlet on the enormous four-poster bed at the east end of the room.  
A heavy mirror in an elaborate gilt frame shares a wall with a still-life 
painting.  The ceiling is plastered in white, the smooth surface decorated 
with sculpted plaster medallions and borders depicting laurel leaves, fruit, 
and small birds.  A polished, wooden staircase set against the northern wall 
leads down.  Oil lamps with shades of shirred, sapphire silk supplement any 
natural light with their cool glow.

headboard is covered by deeply-graven ivy vines, the leaves writhing and 
curling over the outer boarders.  Carved ivy also twines up the posts on 
each corner, each as thick as a man's leg and topped with a steeple-shaped 
finial.  Weathered brass curtain rings in the shape of wreaths hold 
finely-woven damask curtains in an intense shade of cerulean.  The mattress 
forms a pale, yielding nest amidst the dark wood, covered in crisp, white 
sheets with the Dyer monogram embroidered in cobalt blue and topped with a 
pearl-hued silken comforter.

    <desc>This area, paved with cobblestones laid in a herringbone pattern, is the 
northwest corner of the town square.  The dark cobbles underfoot are rounded 
and even, rubbed smooth by centuries of traffic.  A green-roofed, octagonal 
gazebo sprouts from the paving stones like an enormous wooden mushroom.  
Seemingly placed in a random, opening in the pavement is a horse-chestnut 
tree, caged round with a green-painted wooden fence.  To the west, a 
tree-edged lane borders the square.  The entrance to the town hall is to the 
north, the broad steps flanked by flowerbeds.  Farther across the square, to 
the east, shops are visible, and to the south, beyond the square and its 
bordering street, are homes.

    <desc>This section of cobblestone-paved expanse serves as the northeast corner of 
the village square.  Herringbone cobblestones, interrupted by occasional 
shade trees, stretch out to the west, southwest, and south.  Green Street 
borders the south edge of the square; a tidy path borders the west.  The 
imposing bulk of the town hall bars the north; the broad steps to the 
building's entrance are farther west.  To the northeast stands an elegant, 
but severe manor house.  Even the garden is mathematically precise.  To the 
east stands a smug, prosperous-looking shop.  The expansive branches of a 
spreading oak stretch out over a tiny, green, lattice fence circling the 
trunk.  In the shade of the branches, blending with the dappled shadows, 
stands a grey statue on a broad, granite socle.

      <desc>This statue stands tall and proud, despite the ample coating of bird droppings covering his high hat and the shoulders of his Victorian frockcoat.  The carving is exquisite, from the elaborate watch fob at his waistcoat pocket to the superior tilt of his pinched nose.  The face is strikingly handsome, despite the debris left by birds and weather, but it is not good-natured.  There are slight hollows worn in the socle by the toes of the statue's pointed shoes.  This has apparently long been a favoured spot for resting in the shade; countless years of dangling heels have worn away part of the inscription on the plaque below the statue.  The name of the man is now lost in a shallow trough of worn stone.  What remains is the information 'Benefactor of Little Hangleton'.

      <desc>This broad garden is characterized by velvet-smooth, meticulously-trimmed lawns, perfectly-clipped hedges, and immaculate flowerbeds.  Not a single stray leaf interferes with the strict precision; each plant nad stone seems to know its part and play it well.  From spring crocuses to autumn asters, the flowerbeds display appropriate and elegant plants in the proper seasons.  A flagstone path leads to the grand front door; no weed nor clod of dirt would dare to dirty the stone surface.

    <desc>A row of adjustable tailor's mannequins stand at attention along the north 
end of this spacious shop.  The polished floor of broad, hardwood planks is 
ringed with chrome racks of completed garments and display shelves of draped 
fabric samples.  At the rear of the room are three, curtained alcoves 
serving as fitting rooms.  Nearby stands a mahogany table in the Queen Anne 
style, topped with a discreet cash register.  Throughout the space, tiffany 
lamps glow with a warm light; each one is perched atop a tiny, 
cabriole-legged table.  The panelled ceiling is inlaid with a fan pattern 
that directs the eye to the western wall and the door below.  The floor 
itself holds a more subtle decoration.

      <desc>Clumps of deep purple lilacs grow towards the glowing moons.  Created by a 
clever witch who enjoyed the sight of ivy, but smell of lilac, the lilac was 
cultivated into a vine-growing organism that grew quickly on the bone dry 
wall.  The witch found, however, that the lilac would perish after a period 
of time if it did not have a moist counterpart.  To save her precious 
lilacs, she cast a spell for ever-growing moss onto the stonewalls where her 
beloved flowers were to grow.

    <desc>. A gorgeous, unnatural depiction of a child's playground rests, painted, on 
the wall of this tunnel.  The slow swaying of several swings, mixed with the 
gentle wave of the flawless grass blades, suggests harmony amongst the 
playful objects.  A large slide reflects the blare of the sun and, combined 
with the occassional birds flying by, indicates warmth in the scene.  The 
mural is a foil of the wall opposite it.  A mud-strewn, dirt wall is barely 
covered by pieces of rotten wood.  The dirt, rocky ground is hard only 
because of the use it has accumulated over the years.  Several candles sit 
along the floor, illuminating the westward-leading path and a tiny, marble 
step-stool that leads upward.

    <desc>The walls of this room are painted a clean, warm white, the better to 
display the vast array of fabric around the room.  The hardwood floor is 
inlaid with rays of canary wood, drawing the eye to a circular medallion at 
the west end of the room: the magical exit down into the Muggle shop below.  
To the north, bolts of inexpensive cloth are stacked on plain shelves of 
varnished wood.  The eastern end of the room showcases a higher grade of 
material; each fabric is draped carefully forward so that the textures, 
colours, and patterns are clearly visible.  In the south side of the space 
are racks, holding ready-to-wear robes and custom creations ready for final 
fittings.  Positioned around the medallion in the floor are elaborately 
carved mahogany stands, each displaying one of the most expensive fabrics to 
its full advantage.  A fitting room stands in the northeastern corner, the 
walls formed of heavy curtains of amethyst velvet.

    <desc>Announcing the arrival or departure from this shop, a tiny bell tinkles 
above the northwestern, oak door.  Tawny wood matching the entrance hugs the 
walls, floor, and ceiling.  The floor is a bit worn, but glistening from the 
glossy polish applied daily.  Even the bookshelves, desk, and chair match 
the wood, though they are uniquely inscribed with runic symbols.  The two 
topaz, stained glass windows allow yellowish light to filter through.  Four 
gold lamps grace each corner adorned with the same caramel-coloured glass as 
the windows.  In fact, the room would resemble a drop of honey if it weren't 
for one thing, the hundreds of books lining the shelves of this cramped 
bookstore.  These second-hand books are of varying shapes, kaleidoscopic 
colours, and a motley of types.  Signs along the walls display the types of 
books below them.  Framed, black and white etchings hang upon the walls.  
Though Muggles seem unable to notice, next to the desk is a stairwell 
leading up to the wizarding bookstore.  The door to the west leads into the 
private residence of the book owners.

    <desc>This cosy living area is cluttered with books of all types and sizes.  The 
north end of the room is given over to a modest, but well-maintained kitchen 
area, with a white gas range and dark-finished, oak cupboards.  The rest of 
the space is crammed full of overstuffed armchairs, battered, but polished 
oak bookshelves, and an abundance of tiny, oval end-tables.  The shelves 
groan under the weight of books in conditions ranging from tattered to 
well-loved.  The now-muted colours of the covers give the room a warm and 
comfortable look.  The windows, to the north and south, are covered with 
ruffled eyelet curtains, sheer enough to admit some light during the day.  A 
number of old-fashioned oil lamps drift aimlessly about the room; their 
flames brighten and dim as they move, keeping the ambient light at a soft 
glow, suitable for reading.  Wedged in amongst the shelving on the eastern 
wall is a worn oak door with a tarnished brass handle, leading to the family 
bookshop, Faded Fables.  The western wall is dominated by a fireplace, the 
associated fittings and tools all of the same tarnished brass as the door 
handle.

    <desc>Burled elm sprawls leisurely across the floor and ceiling.  Ecru parchment, 
adorned with elm and magnolia leaves as well as lavender and chamomile 
blossoms, line the wall.  Along the northern wall is a rainbow assortment of 
jars, each holding a multifarious amount of quills.  Ranging in price, the 
quills have been provided by every type of bird imaginable.  Sitting amongst 
these quills is a collection of styli.  The opposite wall is a resplendent 
display of papyrus, parchment, and vellum.  A potpourri of curios, 
bookmarks, and sweets are peppered throughout the store.  Origami-birds 
flutter through the air, spilling light along their flight.  The exit to the 
east leads to Tattered Tales.

      <desc>Multihued jars are lined one after another upon three elm shelves.  On the 
top shelf are exotic, limited-in-supply quills made from Wilas, Alkanosts, 
hippogriffs, harpies, Augureys, Firebirds, Diricawls, Fwoopers, Pegasi, 
Abraxans, Sirins, Granians, Occamies, Gumayuns, griffins, Thestrals, and 
more.  Along the second shelf are luxurious quills, though they are more 
common than the exotic ones.  They include feathers from peacocks, condors, 
ostriches, tinamouses, loons, flamingoes, pelicans, eagles, owls, storks, 
falcons, parrots, hawks, colies, and etc.  The bottom shelf holds the more 
ordinary, hence more affordable, quills and styli.  The quills are made from 
chickens, pigeons, gulls, crows, and numerous others.  The styli are 
fashioned from reeds, oak, and pine.

      <desc>Minute figurines of wizarding children, sprinkled throughout the store, have 
doe-eyes and cherubic smiles with brightly-coloured wands.  Book stands, 
wizarding chess sets, Gobstones, and additional games are displayed around 
the store.  An elm stand, centred in the room, holds pots of ink.  The ink 
is available in varying shades, including white for dark-coloured parchment, 
sparkling, glowing, and flashing inks.  The bookmarks are either adorned 
with images of wands, wizard hats, potion bottles, or brooms; or they hold 
inspirational phrases, such as, &quot;Be the best wizard you can be&quot;, &quot;Charm 
others with your smile and not your wand&quot;, and 
&quot;What a disastrous web we weave
When arrogance is what you feed.&quot;

    <desc>This comfortable, but modest room is bright and cheery.  The walls, ceiling, 
and floor are freshly whitewashed; double-hung sash windows on the south and 
west walls let in ample natural light when it is available.  Pressed, 
red-and-white, gingham curtains provide a measure of privacy when it is 
desired.  Oil lamps hanging from the ceiling on weathered, brass chains 
provide warm, golden light to supplement or replace any sunlight.  Worn, but 
still colourful rag rugs add interest to the pale floor, and 
inexpertly-framed folk-art decorates the walls.  A wooden door, painted red 
to match the curtains, is set in the north wall, leading out into the 
street.  The east side of the room is given over to a living area, with a 
small fireplace, complete with a battered brass fender.  To the south is a 
compact, but functional kitchen.

member or another.  A laboriously-stitched sampler, featuring a 
slightly-lopsided hummingbird which dutifully flits from improbable bloom to 
unlikely perch, is signed 'Eglantine E.  - 10 years old'.  A wooden plaque 
bears a wood-burned water-mill, the wheel turning as the water, indicated by 
dark lines charred into the wood, flows.  Surrounded by slightly-mismatched 
laths, stained dark brown, is a vivid painting of a cottage garden in 
unnatural colours.  The plants wave in the wind, and a painted bee travels 
aimlessly about the canvas.

    <desc>This rather small town hall is decorated in overstated, neo-gothic style.  
The walls are stone-clad to ten feet above the slate floor and continue on 
in white plaster, soaring to the vaulted ceiling above.  The overall effect 
is analogous to being at the bottom of an ornate elevator shaft.  The heavy, 
oaken door in the south wall has complicated, hand-forged hinges and an 
elaborate handle.  Heavy, black, wrought-iron chains from the ceiling above 
hold iron chandeliers with electric lights intended to resemble fat candles. 
 The soft, honeyed glow gleams off a copper sign mounted on the slate-topped 
desk serving as a reception area; behind it, a door, smaller than the main 
one, but just as heavily decorated, leads east.

    <desc>The floor of this lavish entrance hall is made of pristine, marble tiles, 
gleaming in a tasteful, but not overly-bright, shine.  The magnificent 
double doors to the southwest are designed from polished mahogany, carved 
with geometrical, curved patterns of French origin.  Glossy red marble walls 
give way to discreet, mahogany doors heading north, northeast, and east.  
The Languedoc marble continues up to the ceiling's fan vaulting.  Engraved 
along the ribs of the vaulting are fleurs-de-lis and geometrical patterns 
that match the doors'.  Should any darkness, magical or otherwise, prevent 
light from pouring in through the grand, side windows, the diamond-wrought 
chandeliers flicker immediately, gradually evolving into a brilliant 
incandescence.  In the centre of the room, beneath the mezzo chandelier, 
stands an elegant, round, mahogany table with a fleur-de-lis etched across 
it.  Upon the table is potted plant comprised of the following: the vase is 
garnet, lustrous pink and white pearls are the soil, the stems are ruby, and 
the dancing leaves are forged from diamonds.  Portraits of proud, elegant, 
obviously important people, hang everywhere; the men and women within like 
to observe any visitors and sniff their displeasure or smile their approval. 
 A winding, marble staircase leads upward.

    <editdraft>This is a lavish entrance hall to the great Reynell mansion.  The main 
entrance to this room is the oak double doors toward the southwest.  The 
floor is made completely of white marble tiles, and the ceiling is decorated 
with obscure artwork.  The walls are cream-coloured, but covered in pictures 
of impressive-looking people.  At the very centre of the room is a small, 
polished buffet table.  On top of this is a green, potted plant with large 
leaves.  Light pours in from the high windows and from brilliant, hanging 
lamps on the ceiling.  There are five exits from this room, north, east, 
northeast, up, and southwest.

light from pouring in through the grand, side windows, the rich candelabra 
immediately light in a fierce, glorious brightness.  In the centre of the 
room, beneath a chandelier, stands en elegant, round, mahogany table, upon

      <desc>The mahogany table supporting this potted plant is polished and covered in a 
complicated embroidery of artistic motifs describing various styles of 
dancing.  Either having had nothing else to do but study the artwork for the 
many years of its life, or because it is like this by nature, the plant is 
fond of dancing with its diamond leaves.  Elegant and gleaming in natural or 
candle light, it appears at first nothing more than a decorative bunch of 
leaves which all curve inwards, shaping a sort of crown.  At the slightest 
hint of a footstep tapping a rhythm, however, the leaves spring out, 
twisting and bending in a breathtaking dance.

contrast to the plain, white-plastered walls.  This room is lit by steady 
candle-flames encased within glass globes resembling light bulbs; these are 
mounted in simple, frosted-glass fixtures of Muggle design.  A staircase of

permeates this inviting, aristocratic common room.  Sprinkled throughout the 
room are plush armchairs; swathed in emerald, amethyst, ruby, and sapphire 
colours, their toile fabrics are woven with the prints of &quot;The Beguiling of

peacefully upon the small, cherry wood tables that lounge next to the 
overstuffed chairs.  The rich, opulent paintings and tapestries hung upon

area.  The sumptuous, champagne-coloured carpet echoes the lavish atmosphere

Arihant Flower Green marble, spiral staircase, situated in a corner, leads

clustered around a small table nearby, where a few candles are burning.  The 
moving portraits on the walls smile as they chatter happily with each other, 
their cheerful backgrounds echoing the atmosphere of the room.  To the south 
is a luxurious hotel room, and the door to the north opens to Green Street 
and the Village Square.  An ornate spiral staircase leads both up and down.

      <desc>Woven to depict the famous painting, the background portrays a verdant, viridian forest.  Merlin, wearing azure robes, lies upon the forest bed.  Framed in silver hair, his aging face appears drowsy.  Nimue, also known as &quot;the Lady in the Lake&quot;, walks away from Merlin, her plum-coloured robe brushing along the foliage.  Her fresh face looks over her shoulder, casting one last glance upon Merlin, the victim of his own folly for teaching her his astonishing ingenuity in magic.

      <desc>Circe's image, with her pale skin and dark hair, is interwoven into the thick material.  She wears an indigo tunic, leaving her shoulders bare.  She holds a glass basin from which spills a poison-green liquid upon the waters she floats upon.  Chocolate-coloured rocks rise behind her and Scylla writhes under the waters as she changes from her divine form and into the deadly sea monster.

      <desc>Instead of bearing wallpaper, these walls are richly hand-carved, their 
cream colour breaking in patterns of stylized roses of a shocking, exquisite 
delicacy.  The miniature models are subtle, drowned in the gentle lighting, 
serving as a nearly-unnoticeable delight to outline the many tapestries and 
portraits that cover the walls without crowding them.  The tapestries serve 
more as reminders of heroic deeds of wizards and witches worldwide, from the 
battling of a manticore to the brave beguiling of a Sphinx.  The portraits, 
on the other hand, appear to focus on the protagonists of such deeds, rather 
than on exactly their merits.  The western wall shows an array of rather 
giddy, tipsy, and mischievous witches and wizards, who enjoy wine and 
upper-class company.  The eastern wall, however, exhibits three rather 
remarkable specimens.  The frames are all of richly-carved ebony with 
delicate, golden fibres tracing their intricate etchings.  In the middle is 
the painting of a red-haired woman at the full blossom of her terrible 
beauty; as an escort to her right is an elderly, stern, white-haired man 
leaning against a staff, while to her left is the horrific, hovering 
skeleton of what might once have been a priest of death.  Inscribed in 
white, calligraphic letters beneath the canvas, into the frame, are three 
names; the woman is called Wee-Jas, the wizened wizard is Boccob, and the 
skeletal horror is Vecna.

      <desc>Leaning against a staff, an old man critically gazes at his surroundings, 
mounted upon the moving canvas of this portrait.  Fire in the fiercest of 
golden colours blazes around him, in tandem with the hundreds of glowing 
runes etched into his deep-mauve robes.  The symbols are gleaming each in 
turn, as though triggered by some mysterious feeling or movement, 
representing a small part of this remarkable man.  He is old, the wrinkles 
on his hands and face conclusive to that effect, but there is a vividness 
about him, perhaps in the open criticism in his firmly-set mouth or in the 
blazing ice of his blue eyes.  One, snow-white eyebrow is cocked upwards at 
all times, the eye beneath it awake and interested; the other is set in a 
half-frown, the eye, easy to condemn and judge.  As white as his eyebrows, 
his venerable hair is caught in two braids that fall against his chest, on 
either side, hidden in the crook of his arms as he leans against the staff.  
The old man does little but watch and notice things.  In his hands, the old 
piece of wood that steadies him is etched on the handle with some of the 
same runes that live against the man's robes; atop the staff stands a mark 
shaped like a pentagon holding an open eye upon a pedestal.

      <desc>Magic is certainly tightly bound to the creature within this portrait, as it 
seems to be missing most of its vital parts.  A skeletal silhouette of 
horror, mockingly dressed in the shroud-like remains of what might once have 
been the symbolic, revealing robes of a death priest, hovers in mid air 
against a livid background; the bones are torturously delicate and sickly 
white.  Great bangles, symbolic scones, and long chains hang about the waist 
of this creature, made of pure and heavy gold; the colour is faded and 
drained, as though the very life had been sucked out of the metal.  The 
creature turns in what appears to be a mad, ritual dance, its silver, 
thinned out hair twisting and turning about its skeletal head underneath a 
circlet of gold with a sharp point in the middle.  A heavy book leans 
against the creature's right hand; the left is missing from the wrist.  Upon 
the few occasion that the thing pauses enough to face the world around it, a 
single, crimson eye blazes in its socket; the left is conspicuous only by 
its utter absence.

      <desc>A skeletally thin hand wraps around the covers of a book fastened at both 
the upper and lower ends in thick, tightened, leather belts, either 
signifying that the knowledge within is a secret, or suggesting that it is, 
in some way or another, lethal.  The covers of the book are a steel blue; 
the material is certainly strong, as the hardened bones that hold onto it 
have barely left a marking throughout the ritual spinning of their owner.  
No title is visible beneath the buckles of the two belts; in between them, 
however, a golden etching of a hand holding an eye is clearly visible.

      <desc>A sense of dense power radiates from the supremely-beautiful woman that 
twists and kneels in some strange ritual against the deep-green canvas of 
this portrait.  Everything about her is magnificent and deadly; her eyes 
blaze with unquenched fire, their red pupils in tandem with the crimson of 
her lips and the waves of her dark-red hair.  Her complicated hair-do must 
need magic indeed to keep it in place, as waves of hair twist, knot, and 
turn around each other, caught together only by a skull-shaped pin above her 
ivory, perfectly smooth forehead and by a strange instrument that looks like 
the stylized shape of a butterfly, its wings having become sharp implements 
that pierce the air sideways, tangled with elegantly-straying strands.  
Heavy, chain-like earrings hang from her ears, caught onto a large, metal 
amulet representing a skull wreathed in flame that is fastened against the 
base of her throat.  The simplicity of this woman's dress does little to 
conceal the perfect curves of her body as she confidently steps forth, 
kneels, then rises, blazing with power.  Her eyes do not waver at all 
beneath the arched, supremely-confident eyebrows, leaving no doubt that she 
knows exactly what impression she creates with her radiance and supreme, 
intangible beauty.

intricate champagne and ebony sigils.  Creamy, textured walls harbour 
portraits in richly stained and filigreed frames.  They hold depictions of

    <desc>A sense of wealth, opulence, and sophistication swirls from the plush, 
scarlet carpeting to the smooth, white-washed ceiling, surging off of this 
room's walls like a tidal wave.  Honey oak panelling, intricately carved 
with patterns of magical creatures, lines the bottom half of the walls.  
They lend a gentle elegance to the remaining halves, textured and cobalt 
blue.  An extravagantly carved mantelpiece, hanging above a monumental, 
marble fireplace, is fashioned from the same wood as that of the wall 
panels.  Plush chairs and a lavish sofa are accompanied by several, 
extravagant side tables.  They are arranged around the hearth, creating a 
warm and cosy environment.  Shelves built-in on both sides of the fireplace 
hold many assorted knick knacks and curios.  Cabinets made of glass hang 
above a marble countertop, their contents visible through crystal panes.  
One of the cabinets houses various beverages, obviously chilled from the 
frost along the pane, while the others hold an assortment of glasses.  A 
large window, framed by pale silver curtains, lets in vast amounts of light 
on sunshiny days.  An ample and ostentatious, four-poster bed takes up most 
of the room; its navy blue, silken covers glimmer seductively in the light 
emitted from the twin, crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling.  They 
cast a creamy, white glow over the entire room.  Two, stately armoires sit 
proudly on either side of the bed.  Leading to the landing to the north, a 
heavy, oaken door waits, its face carved with intricate designs.

eastern part of the room, the navy blue silken covers glimmering seductively

    <editdraftcomments>I went ahead and took out a lot of the directional adjectival phrases.  They 
do lend a lot of nice detail and awareness of what the room 'is', but since 
there's so many it sort of drags the desc down in too much detail.  You've 
done an excellent job of describing items in the room, that there are so 
many items that the specific location isn't necessary since it makes a room 
desc incredibly long.  I chopped down some of the sentences as well.  Since 
they're so long (I have the same habit, so I understand!!)  It also bogs the 
writing down.  Descs need to clip at a good speed.  Cutting down our natural 
tendency of packing in tons of detail in one sentence allows the reader to 
read through it with continuous breaks instead of trying to keep track of 
what the sentence was dealing with to begin with.  I changed the part about 
sunlight as there will be dark, dreary, grey days as well.  (Oh, cozy is 
cosy in Brit English.  *lousy Brits*) I also added new adjectives around 
many of the items as the word 'large' was used quite a bit.  There are so 
many fab words for large that I like to seek them out.

heavy objects having been dragged across the ground; the lane is bumpy and 
littered with small, circular holes where a particularly sharp object has

fence.  A wooden sign attached to a large gate reads, &quot;Ikin's Junkyard - 
whatever anybody threw away is still here&quot;.  To the east stands a small, but

hinting at extensive use of a common home-made cleaning potion.  In the 
western wall, a door of worn, pine planks leads to the street outside.  
Casement windows of bubbled glass flank the door.  The northern side of the 
room is given over to a tiny cooking area.  A dilapidated table, complete 
with mismatched chairs, occupies the northeast corner.  The southwest corner 
holds a pocket-sized fireplace.  The remaining furniture is tidily arranged 
around the fireside.  The walls are not freshly-painted, carrying a scuffed 
coat of cream that has worn off in places, revealing layers of mustard, sage 
and faded blue underneath.  The floor is in similar condition.  Straight, 
white candles with meticulously-trimmed wicks provide light when required.

many planks of varying lengths and widths.  A section near the floor was 
evidently replaced when the wood wore thin, with odd scraps of lumber fitted 
in to the gaps where the damaged place was cut away.  The once-brass finish 
on the door-handle has been rubbed off by years of hands.  The glass ball 
that originally formed the knob was lost or broken long ago, and has been 
replaced by a whittled and smoothed chunk of oak burl.  Depressions echoing 
the placement of fingers on the doorknob have been worn into the tough wood 
with long use.

tiles, the handkerchief-sized counter has been laboriously patched in places 
with fragments of crockery, carefully chipped to fit.  The grout is 
meticulously clean; though its age-roughened surface does not gleam, it does 
remain stubbornly and proudly white.  A decrepit two-burner range serves for 
cooking: The burners are of different styles, and neither quite fits the 
scarred, harvest-gold range top.  One of the control knobs is black and the 
other was once white, though exposure to heat has turned the base brown, 
shading to taupe at the top.  Shelves hold the dishes and cooking equipment, 
visible through the spotless curtains, translucent and threadbare from many 
washings, that serve as cupboard doors.  No two cups are the same; most are 
cracked or chipped.  Still, they are aligned in their ranks with military 
precision, handles all set at precisely the same angle.

been made with furniture polish.  One leg - the only one that matches the 
maple-wood top - has a folded bit of cardboard wedged beneath it in an 
attempt to prevent the table from wobbling.  The other three legs appear to 
have been cut down from other pieces of furniture.  One, its cracked wood 
held together with plumber's clamps, has a distinctly gothic style, complete 
with a clawed foot at the base.  The tip of the carved paw has been 
truncated to make the leg level with the others.  In the center of the table 
sits a doily, crocheted out of coarse yarn; atop the decorative circle sits 
a chipped gin bottle holding a bouquet of bright red geraniums.

growing there.

It has recently been expanded, with previously-used bricks of differing 
sizes, colours, and materials set in homemade mortar.  The edges of the 
expanded hearth are mathematically and meticulously straight, every brick is 
precisely level, and every corner is perfectly square.

    <desc>Dozens of old doors, covered in chipped, flaking paint, lie stacked against 
one wall of this sweeping, herringbone-bricked yard.  Neat piles of rusted 
tools, bent nails, and mismatched doorknobs are arranged alongside the path 
to the southeastern entrance- a battered, yet immaculate, cedar door set 
into a deep, rust-coloured archway.  A collapsed, canary yellow tractor lies 
in a disassembled heap in the western corner, marking the boundary between 
the Ikins' property and the steep Chapel Hill beyond.  The rest of the space 
houses a diverse collection of cluttered scrap: wheelbarrows, lawnmower 
motors, bales of twine, and television aerials, all in various stages of 
disrepair.  A thin piece of frayed rope fences off the northern exit to the 
road.

    <desc>From the well-swept, deeply-worn doorstep to the walls scrubbed nearly bare 
of aged whitewash, this small shop is threadbare, but scrupulously clean.  A 
mismatched assortment of dilapidated shelving fills all available floor 
space, leaving a narrow aisle from the worn cedar door on the northwest 
wall, to the eastern end of the room where a battered table serves as a 
counter.  The broad, cedar floorboards are worn into a shallow trough along 
the aisle, patched here and there with fragments of packing crates.  The 
path leads past the makeshift counter in the east, and extends to the west 
wall near the door, where an antiquated wooden ladder leads up to a trapdoor 
in the ceiling.  Every inch of the horizontal surface from the shelves to 
the ends of the ladder steps, is packed with carefully-dusted objects that 
might charitably be called 'odds and ends'.  A less delicate observer might 
simply call these assembled knickknacks 'junk'.  Oil lamps, as assorted as 
the merchandise, light the place after dark; during the day, any sunlight 
streams in through windows on the north and south walls.

that's all!  Keep up the magnificent work.

    <editeds>The only change I made was to your carefully-dusted ed, and the last

I think that comma after broad should be removed from your keyword list.  Or

leans drunkenly against a pine bookcase for support.  An improvised

holds shelves formed from scrap lumber, painstakingly fitted and joined into 
long boards.  A black mesh rack is reinforced at the corners with twisted 
lengths of wire; a folded bit of cardboard props up one, spindly foot,

palest jade, followed by barely-noticeable azure through to intense cobalt.  
A few, chipped, amethyst vessels grace the end of the shelf.  Old, tin toys, 
their paint chipped and their surfaces dented, populate another shelf.  A 
grouping of slightly-corroded, battered chisels and awls are neatly lined up 
along a grooved, wooden plank.  Wire whisks, rolling pins, and other 
well-used kitchen necessities have taken over a corner of the room.

    <desc>Most of the floor space in this room is occupied by a double bed.  Covered 
with a much-mended quilt sewn from scraps of threadbare fabric, the 
lumpiness of the mattress is still apparent, as is the distinct sag in the 
middle.  When the trapdoor at the foot of the western wall swings open, it 
barely clears the battered steamer trunk sitting at the foot of the bed.  
The narrow floorboards, grain and knots standing out prominently where 
softer wood has worn away through the years, are thoroughly swept.  A small 
strip of rug beside the bed gives bare feet a warmer reception than the 
uneven floor.  The nap on the rug has worn down to the supporting weave, and 
any colours it once held are faded beyond memory; still, not a fleck of lint 
contaminates the surface.  This room holds neither closet, nor wardrobe.  
Clothing hangs on a series of pegs and hooks, instead.  A small, single-hung 
window sits over the head of the bed; a candle in a battered, brass 
candlestick sits on the sill.

      <desc>Sewn in what is commonly known as 'crazy-quilt' style, this bed-covering 
incorporates fabric including threadbare canvas, shabby corduroy, and frayed 
calico.  The bright hues of the fabric are bleached out to greyed pastels 
over many washings, giving the whole a muted, harmonious effect.  Sewn 
together with stitches so fine as to be nearly invisible, some of the 
odd-shaped scraps are no larger than a postage stamp.

cranberry-coloured flames take up the task, sitting in chipped mason jars 
placed at intervals across some wall-shelves.  More a dead-end hallway than 
a true shop, the room barely permits two people to pass in the narrow canyon 
between shelf-studded walls.  The merchandise, such as it is, crowds all 
horizontal surfaces, and a few items dangle from the pine beams supporting 
the ceiling, suspended from rose-headed nails on loops of much-used jute 
twine.  The western wall is bare of shelving; in the scuffed whitewash is 
painted a crude representation of a wooden door, though the doorknob is 
perfectly real.  Hanging from the painted knocker is a wooded sign, also 
real.  'Muggle shop this way,' it reads.  'Are ye decent?'

      <desc>For sale here are all manner of reclaimed wizarding items.  Some have been 
gently used and are in good shape.  Others are decrepit, though frequently 
dusted.  One entire shelf is dedicated to chipped chess sets, most with 
pieces missing.  One board holds pieces in a dozen styles and colours; all 
of the pieces shrink nervously away from a glowering white knight easily 
twice the size of any of the others.  Dangling from a nail overhead, an 
animated feather-duster flops like a broken-winged, mangy pigeon, scattering 
bits of grey feather beneath it.  Given pride of place in a collection of 
used school supplies and marked-up textbooks is a dinted and dinged pewter 
model of the solar system, squeaking and gyrating as it valiantly attempts 
to replicate the paths of the heavenly bodies.  Jupiter's moons are stuck; 
they stutter back and forth in a spastic boogie more reminiscent of the 
Funky Chicken than the smooth, ellipsoid dance of the spheres.

    <desc>This grand stairwell starts as two large arches spanning out from the

landing.  Waist-high, marble banisters line the two arches and the balcony 
of sort.  Continuing the pattern from the entrance, the walls on either side 
of the steps are covered in a cream-coloured, luscious velvet.  In spite of 
its pallor, however, this stairwell is by no means light: not in weight, 
being made out of large slabs of white marble, nor in luminance, as no 
window adorns it.  Only far-spaced candles, caught in sculpted handles that 
look like wrapped, human hands, shed a dim glow on the reflecting, cold 
marble.  Finally, this majestic structure's atmosphere is certainly not 
light: neither paintings, nor any other decoration breaks the wearisome 
monotony of this sumptuous, pompous stair as it starchedly climbs up from 
the landing and up to the northeast.

white, only slightly mollified by fragments of reddish mahogany.  Delicate, 
pristine, but hard marble covers the entire floor, giving in to 
white-painted walls and a matching, Orient-inspired ceiling.  Crimson, 
velvet curtains drip thickly against the walls, embracing the form of the 
stone below and that of a few tapestries framed in thick gold.  A northern 
window sheds fierce, reddish light during the day, while the diamond wrought 
chandeliers hanging from the curved, carefully-engraved ceiling are ready to 
supply a measure of brightness whenever the occasion calls for it.  A sofa 
in the crisp, Louis XIV style leans against one of the walls; a lavish divan 
with crimson and gold covering rests before a magnificent fireplace, pillows 
scattered all over it.  A chestnut cabinet sits in the northwestern corner, 
beside a low seat and a priceless, gold-engraved harp.  A pair of discrete,

    <name>The Reynell Banquet Hall</name>

    <desc>. The grand Reynell banquet hall, famed for hosting opulent feasts of wealth 
and prominence, hosts an enormous dining table draped in nightshade silk.  
Though richly furnished, the atmosphere is one of cold detachment, as if 
keeping the occupants under scrutiny.  Rich, intricately detailed 
tapestries, depicting lithe witches and sylphlike wizards, ascend to the 
lofty ceiling- an inky, black heaven over the chamber below.  Amongst the 
bespoke, chestnut cabinets and atop the many glass-fronted bookcases, a few 
slender, crystal vases of orchids bring a fragile wisp of life into the 
otherwise funereal hall.  There is a large, wooden archway to the east, and 
a grand hallway to the southwest.

      <desc>Hanging from the staggeringly high ceiling, these incredible tapestries 
depict hundreds of elegantly dressed witches and wizards performing a number 
of strange, ritualistic dances.  Some of the dancers are mechanical and 
precise while some seem to merge into one fluid organism.  All performers, 
however, are staring blankly out at the hall, a thousand eyes observing 
every detail.

    <desc>Marble tiles in the deepest shade of crimson are aligned on the floor of 
this majestic, high chamber, the colour in tune with the scarlet of the 
walls.  Thin, delicate threads of pure gold span out an infinitely intricate 
web against the centre of the floor, supporting the weight of a long, 
sumptuous, mahogany table.  The matching seats are luxurious, with arm rests 
curving inwards at elbow height; geometric designs stream across the high 
backs of these chairs.  In its central position, the table allows quick 
service from a few, discreet, coiled staircases that disappear below; from 
their stern locations across the walls, some portraits watch any comings and 
goings with critical, stern expressions.  Dazzling, white curtains, woven 
from the finest silk, filter light into the blood-shaded room; at mid day, 
the rays of light cut a rather splendid, geometric pattern across the 
crimson marble.  Rich chandeliers, blazing as soon as darkness settles in, 
provide alternative lighting.  Two mahogany doors stand to the west.

      <desc>There are a few portraits hanging against the scarlet walls, their golden 
frames surrounded by graceful, silk, white drapes.  From within the borders 
of their painted domain, stern, proud occupants gaze down at the dining 
table with eyebrows prepared to rise disapprovingly.  Into each of the 
frames, a name is carved; most of these are members of the Reynell family, 
except one held at great honour, higher than all the rest - Salazar 
Slytherin.  The most significant portraits beside his stand at his sides and 
opposite him, representing, so to see, Chatelaiyn de la Croix Reynell, 
Conntablis Reynell, and Sorcire Lagrange d Reynell.

      <desc>The character in this portrait revels in the honour that has been granted 
him and often looks down upon his peers in other paintings, gloating.  The 
skilful artwork is not focused on Salazar's rather thin frame, nor upon the 
rather knobbly paleness of his skin; instead, the artist has chosen to 
splendidly reveal Slytherin's lavish, green, hunter's clothing, and his 
high, elegant, dragon-hide boots.  The man's face, with high cheekbones and 
a crayoned, thin-lipped mouth, is thrown into sharp relief, thin hairs 
gathering like spidery, clutched hands beneath a wilful chin.  The corners 
of the mouth are twitchy, as though the man is always prepared to sneer in 
the deepest disgust.  Upon his breast is a heavy locket that Slytherin 
proudly throws into notice from time to time by careful movements of his 
hand.

      <desc>This man is tall and majestic, dressed in white robes covered by a 
deep-crimson, velvet cape.  His physique is athletic, as he well shows in 
his stiff, arched posture; in his hand, he holds a wand with a wider handle, 
into which is the etched shape of a key.  With a medieval, rich hat 
resembling a bishop's, the middle-aged individual struts through his 
painting with a severe expression and a thin mouth.  His eyes are keen and 
blazing, deep-green in colour, though the eyebrows have the unfortunate 
habit of curling upwards in displeasure.

      <desc>This sinister, grey-haired man is sinister and wise beyond his years, his 
bloodshot, dark eyes gazing at the world with exhilarated madness.  He wears 
simple, Spartan clothing, with a pleasant line that catches his broad 
shoulders well.  Above the heart, on his robes, is a coat of arms depicting 
a blazing wand bleeding crimson droplets; the words: &quot;Soldats De Sang&quot; are 
etched beneath it.  He dances in the portrait in complicated, battle 
postures, the tip of his wand always lit with some form of spell or another. 
 In his frame, beside his name, is etched a single, short, battle slogan: 
&quot;Love deep magic, despise low rabble, but always fight with honour.  Down 
with the Death Eaters!&quot;

      <desc>This woman is fierce in her elegant beauty, dressed in a flowing, crimson 
dress, with a white bodice.  Her rich, dark hair chaotically falls, 
rippling, against her bared shoulders, caught by a crown on her head.  A 
slight tan only enhances the vividness of her blazing, blue eyes; her lips 
are full and red, though not overly long.  She is young, in the prime of her 
life, but her expression is severe and somewhat closed into itself.  The 
wand in her hand is lit in a hundred, different flames; the piece of magical 
wood seems to be the only thing this woman loves, as she revolves and dances 
with it, as though it were a man.

    <desc>The tall, oak panelled walls of this musky, heavily perfumed trophy room are 
lined with broad shelves filled with gold, silver, and glass.  The trophies 
themselves comprise of pieces of armour, coats of arms, priceless artworks, 
and the occasional broken wand.  Adorned with gruesome, mounted animal 
heads, the northern wall is devoted to the triumphs of the hunt.  A large, 
spiked mitt in a sealed case hints at the nature of these creatures' deaths. 
 The floor is covered in pale, white stone with ribbons of deep crimson 
winding throughout.  On the western wall is an archway leading to the 
banquet hall, inscribed with thin, gothic lettering.

    <desc>Sinister, cold, and fierce in its sharp contrast of colours, a landing 
expands here out of the southwestern corner, where a staircase plunges down. 
 To the east and west stand mahogany, double doors, upon which intricate 
carvings trace beautiful, geometrical patterns; beneath the doors, a single, 
huge slab of pure-white marble thrusts out in all directions, serving as the 
floor.  Like a massive, bleeding wound, the walls are covered in violent-red 
velvet, which trickles down the sides of the landing with the thick density 
of molten gold.  Surrounded by swaying, tenebrous darkness, the landing is 
lit in a gaunt, pale glow, coming from millions of small candles placed in a 
silver, ruby-encrusted chandelier.  
</desc>
    <editdraft>This landing of the Chateau upper stairwell expands out of its southwestern 
corner, where a staircase leads down.  Two huge, mahogany double doors open 
on the eastern and western walls.  The square floor in one single, huge slab 
of the purest-white marble.  Some mahogany baseboards line the bottom of the 
cream-velvety walls.  The ceiling is simply painted a off-white colour.  A 
lavish chandelier is the sole ornament of this room, but what an ornament, 
all made out of silver and rubies.

      <desc>The delicately-wrought, silver branches of this chandelier coil in the 
resemblance of deadly, delicate, Devil's Snare tendrils.  The highly 
oxidised, dark-grey surface of the material only accentuates the similarity 
to the plant.  Writhing and coiled like a deadly beast ready to explode in a 
sea of tendrils, the candelabrum stretches wide and high, with unusual 
rubies hanging down it like trickles of blood.  Instead of being faceted as 
common gems, these rubies are cabochons, indicating either at least a 
millennium of existence, or a powerful desire to make it seem so.  Catching 
the light and keeping it with fierce grimness, the cabochons are 
tear-shaped, like drops of an unearthly, tainted blood.

    <desc>Like many rooms on this floor of the Chateau, deep-red, soft velvet bleeds 
along this bedroom's walls, its lower edges thickly trickling against a 
white, fluffy carpet.  Above, the ceiling is mostly white, with threads of 
crimson lashing across it to reach a central, round ruby.  The foot sinks up 
to the ankle in doubtlessly-genuine animal fur, so generously and thickly 
scattered across the floor that one might just as well sleep there.  For 
those who prefer a bed, however, a four-poster rigidly sits against the 
western wall, opposite the door.  Burgundy drapes hang heavily from 
deep-mahogany columns, only allowing a peek at the wine-coloured, silk 
sheets.  Amidst the whiteness of the floor and ceiling, the bed is a dark, 
sanguine stain.  A willow-made wardrobe in tones of light brown somewhat 
neutralises the crimson of the northwestern corner, and the wide, 
mahogany-framed bay-window to the north brings in a touch of reddened, 
much-needed light.

    <editdraft>Like many rooms at this floor of the Chateau, creamy velvet is stretched on 
this bedroom's walls.  The novelty is that the same material covers the 
floor and the ceiling.  The foot sink up to the ankle among the silky 
strands of velvet, so much so that one could sleep on the floor as 
comfortably as in a bed.  Talking of bed, a four-poster sits rigidly against 
the western wall, opposite to the door.  Burgundy drapes hang from 
deep-mahogany column and a sliver of wine-coloured, silk sheets can be seen 
between them.  While the room is overall white, up to the willow wardrobe in 
the northwestern corner, the bed is a dark, sanguine stain.  Only the wide, 
mahogany-framed bay-window on the northern wall brings in a touch of much 
needed light.

Honey-coloured wood frames a western door and a single, northern bay-window;

Ivory-hued, silk drapes, with delicate, rose embroidery, hang around the

      <desc>The lamp is an intricate work of art.  Dark silver is wrought in the 
contorted, twisted form of a rose stem, with little, rounds rubies hanging 
from the thorns.  No leaves adorn it except at the top, where they form a 
cup; there rests a frosted-glass globe, with a red rose motif painted on it. 
 Through the glass, one can barely make out the form of a candle; isolated 
from the world by the thick, beautiful walls of its crystal prison.  Short 
of breaking this magnificent lamp, there is no way for a Muggle to light it, 
as it would take a wand to make the candle within burn.

from the rich earth.  Bracken ferns conceal all ground, except that the 
flagstones have staked out for their own; teasing fronds lean over this 
forbidden zone, tickling the rigid slabs.  Winding through the clumps of

    <desc>This room is a symphony on every variation of the colour green.  The walls 
and ceiling resemble nothing so much as a leafy network of vines, viewed 
from below.  A diffuse viridian glow emanates from the lighter patches, 
lending the shadowy effect of a lush forest on a bright day.  The air is 
heavy, almost humid, stirred by a constant, near-imperceptible breeze.  The 
constant, gentle trickle of water provides a soothing background of white 
noise.  A thick, squashy carpet covers the floor in a coffee-brown coat, 
with the main traffic patterns in the room marked with caf-au-lait paths.  
Broad-leafed tropical, potted plants grow everywhere; the cunningly-designed 
furniture is difficult to differentiate from the flora.  To the east, 
visible through the fronds, is a green door; the round window occupying the 
top half offers a glimpse of a more temperate climate.  The path marked out 
in the carpet leads to a hanging curtain of lianas on the south side of the 
room.

    <desc>Small, white cobblestones happily crowd against each other to form a smooth 
path between the heavy, western door of Willow Nest Cottage, and a 
three-foot tall, light, eastern gate.  Side, cobblestone paths spiral and 
swirl between irregular, vivid patches of seasonal daisies; their white 
colour drowns the occasional soft-pink and yellow of the few rosebushes 
planted here and there.  Every blade of grass growing at the feet of either 
bushes or flowers is intensely lush-green; freshness hangs over the 
beautiful garden like a gentle, lingering perfume.  Three willows on each 
side of the main path swing and dance against a permanent breeze too soft to 
sense.  Their fingers caress the stone sides of unobtrusive, small 
fountains, each with a chubby cherub on top.  The constant trickling of 
water accompanies the soft whispers, moans, and chants of the trees and the 
grass.  A low, white, picket fence separates this explosion of green and 
white from the lane that ambles past to the east.

      <desc>The low, white, picket fence made of painted, willow wood might once have 
been built to separate the outer lane from the garden.  With time, however, 
blades of grass have managed to slip through, raising their heads to the 
critical glances of any passers by.  The gate, slightly taller than the rest 
of the fence, is flanked by two white posts, with tiny cherubs sculpted on 
top.

      <desc>This cottage is medium large and painted white, although the vivid green of the surrounding garden sometimes throws reflections of colour onto the outer walls. Rectangular windows, small, but bright, peek on either side of the heavy, brown, oak door. Underneath the northernmost window stands a small ledge, nearly invisible under a mass of lovely, dazzling, white daisies.

    <desc>This room is a rather small, but comfortable, rectangular entrance hall.  
Beneath a soft, cerulean-blue carpet, the willow wood of the floor slides up 
the walls, panelling their lower halves.  Where the wood kisses the 
light-blue paint of the upper parts of the wall are sconces holding 
gleaming, orange candles that burn with magical, everlasting flames.  An 
unobtrusive, coffee-brown wardrobe stands in the southwestern corner; its 
sliding doors are discreetly three-quarters closed.  A heavy, dark, wooden 
door with an ivory-canvassed medallion leads east into the garden.  To the 
south is the kitchen, emitting an aroma of cookies and fresh fruit in the 
surrounding air.  A cosy living room extends north.  The tunes of a low, 
fervent, insistant Celtic song drift from the western dance salon, as though 
waiting to be unleashed.  Spiralling against a pillar, some twenty feet away 
from the entrance, is a staircase leading up.  A central, Venetian 
candelabrum occasionally adds a pleasant chink to the echoing peace.

      <desc>The door is made of heavy wood, with a round, silver doorknob. About two thirds up its six-foot height is an oval, ivory-canvassed medallion, on the end of a small, silver chain describing a 'V'. On the smooth, inch-thick surface of the painting, perpetually-moving and very vividly-drawn willows sway, dance, twirl, and twist.

A shoe-rack stands at the bottom, filled with all kinds of girl-shoes, from the tallest high-heeled boots to the most comfortable, low carpet slippers.

    <desc>Soft, comfortable, cerulean-blue carpets cover the heavy floor here.  The 
wood is the hue of a Gypsy's mysterious eyes.  A grandfather clock with 
willow patterns smoothes the northeastern corner, turning it into a 
nearly-rounded edge.  The furniture, rich, but cosy, resembles 
sixteenth-century France style, although it is less on the side of luxury 
and more comfort-oriented; the heavy mahogany is here replaced by oak and 
willow.  A rectangular, coffee table and a rounded reading table, both with 
matching chairs, stand at opposite ends of the room.  Sconces line each of 
the four walls; during the day, their tender, orange glow complements 
daylight, replacing it after nightfall.  Against the northwest and southwest 
walls are beautiful, large bookcases, filled with volumes ranging from 
fairy-tales to a large, black-covered copy of the Bible.  Opposite the door 
leading south into the entrance hall is a warm, romantic fireplace; towards 
the west stretches the dining-room.

      <desc>The furniture is rich and comfortable, though not enough to crowd the room with. A coffee table stands east, surrounded by sofas and armchairs; at the opposite end of the chamber is a rounded, two and a half feet tall reading table. The small candlestick on it always holds a perfumed, vanilla-scented candle; its light spreads just far enough to fall on the two, low, overstuffed armchairs beside it.

      <desc>The fireplace is very clean and made of oak wood, polished to a dark, smooth surface, with oriental, curvy patterns carved into it. Behind a black, iron grate, the flames twist and turn in a gentle, sleepy dance; their caress of the surrounding, grey, stone walls is tender and peaceful. A soft rug before the fireplace looks as though it is sometimes used to kneel on, probably on cold, winter nights, when the solitude of the fire is most comforting.

    <desc>A soft sea of cerulean drowns the light-brown floor of this chamber; the 
willow wood panels the lower halves of the walls, only interrupted around 
the southern and eastern doors.  Sconces exuding peaceful, orange glows line 
the walls, flanking vivid paintings and photographs.  An elongated, long 
table that could easily seat twenty people stands in the centre of the room, 
with appropriate, high-backed chairs.  A diamond-shaped, gentle-blue 
tabletop caresses the polished, wooden surface underneath, so long that it 
trails until it nearly reaches the nearby seats.  Just above the table hang 
low, Venetian-glass candelabra holding tiny, lavender-scented candles.  The 
perfume clings to the very walls, ceaselessly swirling in the air like a 
graceful ballet dancer.  The arrangement would look distant, were it not for 
the candle-holder in the centre of the table, which shows three, smiling 
cherubs with cerulean candles in their chubby hands.  The three sculptures 
magically, slowly turn, playing a soft, inviting melody.

      <desc>The frames of these paintings and photographs are all made of a rich, warm, blonde wood that makes a soft contrast to the light blue of the walls. It is remarkable that, although the images rarely contain living things, they are full of life, as though every blade of dewy grass were breathing the scented air in the room. The only recursive theme in all the paintings is the British countryside, with hillocks rolling everywhere. A hint of the Welsh lands appears in one of the northernmost photographs, where blue-bottomed sheep move around, grazing in a slow, satisfied manner.

      <desc>Resting on four, large feet with intricate carvings etched into them is a sturdy, wooden table. Its edges are rounded and its surface is clean and polished, with not even the slightest dent or scratch visible. All around it are about twenty, high-backed chairs with leather covering their soft, plump seats. As though anticipating the delicious meals that the table was likely to hold, the chairs are cushioned on their arched backs, and their arm holders are rounded at the back, able to hold the fullest of bellies in a very comfortable position.

    <desc>This room is always kept rather dark, bathing only in the faint, orange 
light of miniature candelabra that are arranged on the ceiling in the shape 
of a star.  Soft music ceaselessly plays on the background, ranging from the 
softest of love songs to the most impatient Celtic tap-dance.  The floor is 
made of stocky, mahogany wood that dampens any noise to a bare minimum.  A 
small, semicircular podium to the southern side of the chamber is meant for 
any groups that might perform here; otherwise, the room is only furnished 
with large, rich, royal-blue curtains that tumble in heavy waves along the 
walls, framing a range of portraits.  These all represent a single person 
each, some older, some younger, but all very happy in their extravagant 
dresses, bowing, curtseying, winking, or twirling as they fall under the 
eyes of the passers-by.  To the north is the luminous, vanilla scented 
dining room, while a small hall to the east leads out of the cottage.

      <desc>The portraits are aligned every few inches along the walls, undoubtedly all 
picturing frequently-visiting guests.  The gazes of most of these depicted 
friends are focused on a beautiful, lovely girl with clear-blue eyes 
shimmering warm innocence from beneath a restless sea of elegantly-chaotic, 
strawberry-blonde hair.  She is tiny in stature, but her welcoming arms are 
spread as though ready for an embrace, the silk of her long, soft-pink dress 
whispering as she occasionally curtseys.  Grinning at her from across the 
room are three girls; one is smiling amusedly at the world around her, with 
a bright, dancing viridian gaze lighting in sparkles of beaming kindness; 
another, dressed in an exquisite, long, glittering silver dress and wearing 
diamond jewels, stands slightly back, as though balancing herself for a 
football shot; the third, plump and smiling, hums while rocking back and 
forth with the sound of the surrounding songs.  Conspicuous because of his 
evil grin, but charming with his finely-chiselled jaw and deep, thoughtful 
gaze, a dark-haired, young man sporting an acoustic guitar taps his foot 
impatiently, apparently displeased with the sedate rhythm of the surrounding 
music.  Finally, from the other side of the room, another boy in what looks 
to be a Superman suit looks just about ready to take off in an attempt to 
save the world.

    <desc>A light-brown, northern, wooden threshold leads from the entrance hall into 
the cosy kitchen of the Willow Nest cottage.  The floor of this room is made 
of soft-blue marble, spotlessly-clean, but with a few, grey rags covering it 
in ruffled, elegantly-disarrayed heaps.  A rack on the wall holds a few pots 
and pans; the greater part of these, however, is in willow-wood cupboards 
placed at comfortable height.  Along the marble walls are a few yellow 
notices, covered in minute, gleaming-red handwriting.  A dazzlingly-clean 
sink stands beside a series of cupboards, filled with trays, bread, cookies, 
and handy utensils.  In a small basket next to the warm oven are vegetables 
of all sorts, from cucumbers to fleshy tomatoes.  Against the northwestern 
wall is a small, rectangular table and a five-foot tall fridge.  Just above 
the fridge is an appetizing painting of a scrumptious, cream-covered 
birthday cake, with waves of dark chocolate dangling heavily against its 
foamy surface.

Some of these spell things like: 'Jan 9, big, glittery-pink birthday cake for lil sis', 'July 2, fluffy, chocolate filled bonbons for Teeny', and 'Tiny likes honeysuckle '. The handwriting is small, but tidy, with extra curls added everywhere in gleaming-red, magical ink.

    <desc>A winding staircase embracing a central pillar ends here in a small room 
with soft-blue wallpaper that sports tiny, vivid-green, willow designs.  
Unobtrusive sconces along the walls give the soft, cerulean carpet a warm, 
orange glow.  A wooden frame slithers as a banister at the upper edge of the 
staircase; vertical bars made of willow wood prevent any object wider than a 
Snitch from falling.  To the north, northeast, east, south, and southwest 
are wooden, unpainted doors, leading into various other rooms.  Along the 
walls are small pictures, most representing photographs of children, or 
Quidditch scenes.  The frames are diamond shaped and all made of dark wood; 
the moving images are, by contrast, rounded and some of them quite old.  
Ever-young in a picture near the northern room, a fiercely-frowning 
Quidditch player in the robes of Bulgaria looks thoroughly disgruntled as he 
holds the Snitch in his tightly-balled, right fist.

frame of the Bulgarian player, with a group of supporters gathered around 
what appears to be a bundle of green in the hue of Ireland.  The disgruntled 
Seeker in this photograph is bitterly frowning as though deeply grieved and 
disappointed, his fist balled around the Snitch strongly in pointless anger.

    <desc>. An explosion of ruffled wings beating, feathers flying, and softly-startled 
chirping echoes against the walls of this chamber.  The carpet here is made 
of fresh grass, with a whispering pond to the north side.  Thickets of small 
bushes and even an old, gnarled oak curl up from the ground, embracing each 
other in what looks to be a gently-entangled maze of dark-green.  The 
ceiling is made of translucent glass, allowing a glimpse of the heavens 
inside.  A fine coat of feathers lies atop the upper branches of the oak, 
but otherwise most of the room is clean.  A deep fragrance of jasmine and 
soft lily is in the air, coming from nowhere; everywhere in the room are 
nests, varying in size and material, but able to house anything from a 
sparrow to a good-sized falcon.  The entire southern wall is taken up an 
open window, so that the feathery occupants might come and go as they 
please.  A single, rounded door leads north onto the main upper landing 
corridor.

    <desc>This room is rectangular, small enough for comfort, large enough to be 
spacious.  The dark, wooden floor peeks in the corners from beneath a soft, 
vivid-green carpet.  The colour sifts a bit into the soft light-blue of the 
walls, making the lower parts appear aquamarine.  Near the dark, oaken door 
to the west stands a dresser; although its wooden surface is visible, most 
of it is covered by clothes ranging from blue, Tweety socks to a colourful, 
short-sleeved shirt.  Made of blonde, willow wood, a bed leans against the 
northern wall, covered in a quilt and drowning beneath heaps of pants and 
T-shirts.  A night table beside it holds a radio and an enormous pile of 
books of all sizes; from above it, a portrait of a tiny girl smiles 
pleasantly.  At a comfortable distance, a desk stands beneath the single, 
wide window to the northeast.  A central chandelier and a desk lamp are used 
to augment or replace daylight.  To the east, a light-blue door leads to the 
bathroom, while a wooden door stands south.

      <desc>At the very bottom of the pile, supporting the rest of the volumes on their 
large frames, are the Harry Potter books.  These are nearly the only fantasy 
books there; most of the others are vivid, realistic books written in an 
engaging and easy style.

      <desc>The girl appears tiny, but her smile is very pleasant and engaging, her 
startling-blue eyes breathtaking and open.  She is twirling a single lock of 
an elaborate hairdo, humming a Nickelback song as she does so.  The dress 
she is wearing is long and blush-pink, clinging to her curves; the softness 
of the colour matches her smile; the high-heeled, pink sandals glittering 
with silver shimmers.  On the background, a blue, satin curtain rustles 
comfortingly.

Cerulean marble floor and walls, comfortable jaccuzzi bath and tiny shower.  
Fluffy, white rugs.  Smells like soft daisies and there's always bubbles 
swirling and flying everywhere.

Circular room, covered in bookcases and books, with a single, small table in the centre, where a vase contains a beautiful, red rose in full bloom, with daisies surrounding it. Heavy, dark, wooden floor, and a soft-blue ceiling, with a Venetian-glass candelabrum

    <desc>The floor of this entrance hall is covered in square, unglazed terra-cotta 
tiles.  A braided rug in goldenrod and burnt umber provides a warm reception 
for bare feet.  A built-in wooden bench occupies the wall to the west of the 
door, with a rack for shoes tucked in beneath the seat.  The eastern wall 
holds two rows of black, cast-iron coat hooks, one at adult eye-level, and 
another two feet lower.  The walls themselves are slightly-rough plaster 
tinted a rich golden shade reminiscent of a Tuscan sunset.  To the south is 
a sturdy, wooden door with a black iron handle and latch; it leads out to 
the front garden.  Another, identical door to the north leads into the back 
garden.  To the west, a tiled archway opens into a living area; another 
leads east, to the kitchen.  A wrought-iron chandelier hanging from the 
ceiling assists any natural light entering through the oak-muntined 
sidelights that flank the door.  A spiral staircase in the southwest corner 
leads up.

      <desc>This oak door is constructed of thick planks dovetailed together and bound 
with black-painted iron strips and rose-head nails.  The hand-forged hinges 
curl in fanciful scrolls, stretching out across the chestnut-brown wood.  
The curled and twisted handle resembles a loop of ancient ivy; the latch is 
formed into a single, perfect leaf.

delicate metal leaves.  A metal bird's nest nestles on one side of the 
circle; the iron wren occupying it ruffles its wings from time to time.

      <desc>Constructed around a central shaft formed from a gnarled and knotty oak 
trunk, the treads of this staircase spiral up to the floor above.  From the 
delicate curve of the steam-bent handrail to the thick, triangular rays of 
the steps, the entire structure is fitted together without a single nail.

    <desc>The dominant feature of this room is an enormous stained-glass skylight in 
the form of a rose window.  The majority of the panes are in shades of red; 
vermillion, claret, blush, crimson, rust and maroon are interspersed with a 
few thick slabs of colourless, bubbly glass.  The sun's rays daily stain the 
short, plush carpet and the smooth walls with sanguine light, drowning out 
the splashes of untainted illumination that reveal the crisp green of the 
floor and the clinical white of the walls.  A viridian curtain to the south 
separates this room from the next.  Oil lamps with blood-red shades provide 
gory illumination after sunset, supplementing the moonlight that spills 
thinly in.  A spiral staircase with a polished walnut railing leads up.

    <desc>Cool underfoot and to the eye, slate tiles cover the floor in a undulating 
blue-grey expanse.  The smoke-grey walls are windowless and featureless, 
leaving the enormous sloped skylight on the ceiling to draw the eye.  
Mullioned in a spider-web pattern, this glass expanse reveals the moods of 
the open sky, and casts webbed shadows on the room below during the day.  A 
raised, slate-covered dais in the center of the room holds a bed.  Other 
furniture blends unobtrusively with the colour scheme.

    <desc>Every surface in this compact kitchen is meticulously clean.  Though the 
paint on the cabinets may be worn in places, it is as crisply white as 
anyone could desire.  The corners of the soapstone countertop are rounded 
with age, but the surface has been oiled and polished until the grey-green 
material glows.  Apple-green walls contrast with the dark oak floor and the 
exposed beams of the ceiling.  'The venerable, rippled window-glass on three 
walls lets in any sunlight; the view, however, is slightly distorted.  An 
iron lantern suspended overhead provides additional light.  The food 
preparation area is completed by a profound, soapstone sink and an 
antiquated range; a simple eating area is tucked into one corner.  Leading 
east into the entrance hall is a terra-cotta-tiled archway.

    <desc>This room has exposed, wooden beams across the ceiling and large, divided 
windows on three walls.  Long, fluttering, saffron curtains frame the glass 
and brush the floor.  The floorboards are dark-stained oak, pieced together 
from random widths and lengths of methodically-sanded wood.  More oak 
sheathes the walls to the half-round chair-rail mounted at waist-height.  
Above the rail, the plastered walls are painted a deep brick-red.  The east 
wall holds a tiled arch leading through to the entrance hall, but the 
river-rock fireplace is the most prominent feature on this surface.  A rug, 
woven of homespun wool dyed a deep goldenrod, softens the area in front of 
the hearth.  The furniture here is comfortable but rustic, composed of 
hand-peeled birch saplings and deep-yellow cushions.  Family photographs in 
wooden frames adorn the walls, and oil lamps on wooden brackets shed a warm 
glow when natural light is unavailable.

      <desc>Decades of feet and scrub-brushes have worn the flooring to a dull patina, leaving the harder knots protruding slightly from the rippled surface of the fine-grained boards.  Despite the uneven surface, the floor is immaculate; not a speck of dust is to be seen.

      <desc>An impression of solidity lingers around this massive fireplace constructed entirely of rounded rocks and mortar.  Some of the water-smoothed stones are no larger than a fist, while others rival the size of a grown man.  The firebox itself provides ample room to stand, though the irregular, curving surface might make remaining upright a challenge.  A hollow to the north of the hearth holds stacked, split firewood; a metal door above the flames conceals a slate-lined compartment that serves as a warming oven or a convenient place to dry wet socks.

      <desc>This mortise-and-tenon furniture is constructed of peeled birch saplings, peeled and roughly shaped with a hand-adze.  Tool marks and knots are still clearly visible on the golden wood.  Meticulously hand-sewn cushions in shades ranging from burnt umber to straw yellow ensure comfort is not neglected.  A bent-wood bench is padded thoroughly enough to merit the label 'sofa', despite its visible birch bones.  A lovingly-shaped rocking chair sits by the fire, its hewn structure draped with a cosy afghan crocheted with more affection than skill.

    <desc>A riot of plant life fills this wattle-fenced garden.  The ivy-covered, 
dun-brick house to the south is cosily embraced by chaotic flowerbeds.  
Edged with smooth, pale rocks and housing head-high plants, these beds are a 
riot of colour from March to October.  A grassy patch, laid with flat 
stepping-stones in an erratic network of paths leads from the bright-painted 
door to a tiny, burbling spring in the northwest corner of the yard, with a 
small detour to the base of a spreading apple tree.

      <desc>Whispering and chuckling incessantly to itself, a small spring occupies the 
northwest corner of the garden.  Clear, cold water, tasting faintly of 
limestone, flows out into a rock-lined pool the size of a number 2 cauldron. 
 The basin overflows into a meandering, pebble-bottomed rivulet a handspan 
wide; the cheery trickle visits several flowerbeds before slipping out under 
the woven-willow fence.

    <desc>A spiral staircase built around the peeled trunk of an oak tree is the most 
noticeable feature of this landing.  Leading down through the wide-plank, 
oak floorboards is the main trunk, while a few stripped branches stretch up 
overhead, carrying the stirs up to a trapdoor in the ceiling.  The walls are 
a cool, forest green, and some whimsical person has painted oak leaves 
across the age-darkened pine boards of the ceiling.  A cast-iron lantern in 
the shape of a firefly dangles from the end of the longest oak branch.  
Three doors lead out of this room: one, to the northeast, a white door with 
a painted-china doorknob; another, to the west, constructed of oiled and 
polished blonde alder planks, with a wrought-iron handle and latch; the 
third, to the east, is painted cobalt-blue, with a battered pewter doorknob.

    <desc>The hand-plastered walls are painted an unfathomable green, the shade 
varying in undulating ribbons with the texture of the surface.  Windows of 
rippled glass admit any natural light in fragmented patterns like the 
surface of the ocean; the faceted, green, glass shades on the oil lamp 
refract the warm glow into similar, cool, distorted diamonds.  Sheer, 
celandine curtains, hand embroidered with tendrils in a thousand hues of 
green, cast waving shadows.  The eastern door to the room is 
smooth-surfaced, cool to the touch, and dark grey; the doorknob is a 
fist-sized, irregular chunk of glass, buffed and etched by years of sand and 
waves.  The northern door is painted to resemble a cave mouth; the doorknob 
is a brass replica of a starfish.  Underfoot, the yielding gray-green carpet 
is softer and finer than velvet.

      <desc>Between the motion of the light and shadows and the serpentine textures of 
the walls, the green paint seems more than a mere coating.  The slightly 
glossy finish adds reflections of its own, magnifying the shifting shadows.  
When viewed from the corner of the eye, the effect is not unlike being in a 
bed of waving seaweed.

    <desc>The floor and walls of this compact bathroom are tiled in a wild mosaic of 
different hues, sizes, and shapes of ceramic tile.  The white, enamel tub on 
its clawed feet, the plain, white toilet and the pedestal sink stand in 
stark relief against the varicoloured floor and walls.  The wide boards of 
the ceiling have been painted white in solidarity with the fixtures.  
Perched above the southwestern door, the simple, porcelain lamp painted with 
a wispy stalk of forget-me-nots is unremarkable against the bright 
background.  The door to the south, covered in the same multiplicity of 
tiles as the walls, is well camouflaged.  Only the stark white doorknob 
gives away its position.

      <desc>Seemingly pieced together from collected odds and ends of tile, this impromptu work of art follows no regular pattern or obvious picture.  The eye picks out elusive images, though, and the longer one looks, the more shapes emerge.  Rivers, formed of azure, indigo, cerulean, sky blue, and aqua, meander from wall to floor.  Branches of amber, chestnut, buff, sienna, russet, coffee, umber, terra-cotta, and cocoa stretch from surface to surface, casting shadows of dove-grey, ash, oyster, slate, and battleship-grey.  Twining vines in jade, apple, emerald, lime, pine, and sage cling here and there.  Licking flames of claret, titan, coral, cherry, brick, and ruby tease at rays of gold, saffron, butter, and daffodil.

alleviated somewhat by gauzy white curtains at the windows and a blonde 
floor of varnished pine planks.  Painted all over the ceiling and the upper 
part of the walls are hundreds of tiny stars in a range of subtle shades 
from ruddy to powder blue.  A luminous painted moon washes the space in 
pale, silvery light.  The usual compliment of bedroom furniture looks almost 
out of place.  The rug near the bed is a nod to the exterior, resembling a 
tuffty hummock of grass, complete with tiny, woolen wildflowers and a 
single, chenille bumblebee.

A roll-top desk of polished mahogany is tucked in one corner, near the

northwest.  A broad arch to the south allows a glimpse of a kitchen.  
Mahogany wingback chairs, upholstered in burgundy keep company with small,

bushed-brass torchere lamps.  A staircase leads down to the floor below.

    <desc>. This large, square waiting room is nauseatingly pallid and far too brightly 
lit.  The dominating, whitewashed walls enclose their occupants in an icy 
blanket of gloom and despair.  If one is not already ill upon entering, they 
will probably become so rather quickly by staying here.  The ceiling hosts a 
complex, weaving pattern of bright, white globes, slowly pulsating between 
horribly-bright and retina-burning.  The floor, by contrast, is carpeted 
with a soft, dark-coloured pile reeking of cough syrup and ash.  A 
rectangular window in the south wall functions as the reception desk; next 
to it stands a door.  An opaque, plastic curtain hangs over a dim passage to 
the east, obfuscating whatever lies beyond.  The exit outside lies to the 
south huddled with a tightly-wound, spiral staircase.  All along the east 
wall, medium-sized, cushioned chairs accrue dust and bacteria beneath some 
poorly-kept, framed paintings.

    <editdraft>. This large, square room is the waiting area for those who become injured or 
ill.  It is surrounded by white walls, each covered with a few framed 
paintings.  The ceiling is a bright white, emanating a strong light for the 
room.  The floor is made of soft, dark-colored carpet.  A rectangular gap in 
the north wall is the window into the reception desk.  There are two doors, 
each made of solid oak.  One is in the north wall, to the west of the 
reception window.  The second is in the south wall, the exit out of the 
lobby.  Along the west and east walls are medium-sized, cushioned chairs.  
On a table by the south door lies a copy of the Daily Prophet.

    <desc>This corridor, extending to four different rooms, has lime green carpet and 
walls that make it seem light and simple.  On the brightly coloured walls 
are several pictures of certain witches and wizards that either donated or 
are special to the infirmary.  One of the witches in the pictures is wearing 
a black, puffy dress with a dark hat that resembles a large bird.  On the 
southern wall is a small, oak dresser with a single emerald candle on top.  
The candle, burning brightly, is a spiral shape.  Above the dresser hangs a 
large portrait of a white lighthouse, casting its brilliance over the water 
surrounding it.  There are four exits out of this corridor.  They are north, 
east, west, and down.

    <editsecondcomments>Dear Kyle, thank you very much for placing the text of your draft in the draft section and for formatting the desc. I love how this baby formats texts. Your desc was nearly perfect, so I barely had to change anything. I tried, however, to take out some of your 'and's, since those slow the narration quite a bit. Wonderful decorations you have on the ceiling - I'm sure the patients would be really inclined to stay here! :S Anyway, the only central edit I've made is in the last sentence, where I actually tried to tell the readers what the exit looks like rather than what it's called. Gimme a shout, as ever, though, if you think I'm being unreasonable. Good job! `-Cristina

    <editsecondcomments>Dear Kyle, this room is lovely, and I particularly liked the food-tinged lamps. Awesome idea! I've rephrased somewhat a couple of your sentences, however. For instance, in sentence one, you said that only the beds are in the room, but only a few sentences later, you also have cabinets and lamps. I've also somewhat rephrased your sentence about the lightshades, so as to avoid repetitions. I also turned around your six-shooter sentence, because I wanted to break the pattern you had in your sentences and which can get repetitive. Gimme a shout though if you think I was too hard. Otherwise, just small tweaks. I assumed that Blaire instead of Blair was a typo and not something you did on purpose, but do tell me if I was wrong. `-Cristina

    <editdraft>This is Kyle's oringinal version: Two columns of six beds line the north and south walls in this room.  White sheets and one clean, white pillow for each bed make everything look cleaner.  Small tables rest at the right side of each bed.  On some beds are trays with vials of liquid on them, the trays read &quot;antidotes&quot;.  On the small tables next to the beds lie obscure, silvery tools, used for various means of healing someone in this room.  Great, crystal chandeliers line the ceiling, giving the room sufficient light.  There are only a couple of windows on either side of the room, each of them half-covered by floral curtains. 
</editdraft>
    <editdraftcomments>I reworked his version and stuck it in the desc.  If someone feels it should be changed, feel free.  Here are the notes I had for him as well: 
1, Sentence 2, you have 'clean' pillow and 'cleaner' in one sentence; that's too redundant in one desc, if it can be helped, but definitely not in the same sentence.  There are other words that work for clean.  Also, on a side note, you have 'look cleaner'- cleaner than what?  There is nothing to compare cleaner to.  
 
2, in sentence 3 you have &quot;rest at the right side of each bed&quot;, except one row is along the south wall and another row is on the north wall.  It gives the illusion that the beds are next to the walls, making it odd to have a table on the right next to each row.
 
3, you had the word 'bed' in the first 4 sentences.  If a word is able to be changed (I know some just simply cannot be) then aim to change things up so it doesn't sound like a checklist of items.
 
4, I altered the set up of the trays since it seems odd for instruments to be upon beds, especially if we have a full ward from folks RPing in LH.
 
5, since you mentioned 'silver trays', making silver an adjective used in the sentence previous, I changed 'silvery tools' to 'sterling tools', again, to shake things up.
 
6, I changed the lighting in your room since you said 'sufficient light'.  It seems contrary to the rest of your room.  I love the crystal chandeliers as it keeps up the stark white feeling of this room.  Your whole room is about detail and said starkness, sufficient doesn't follow the rest of the room.  The rest of the room is not 'sufficient', but rather set with precision.
 
7, I made the curtains with white daisies to keep the whole 'white' theme going.  Plain floral to me, which is an awesome detail by the way, sounds too colorful for this room.
 
To me it seems you need to learn to let yourself go, to really feel the rooms before writing them.  I can see that you're envisioning the room, but you're not completely 'inside' the room to give it the added detail to make it quirkier or with depth than a regular desc.  Most muds don't put in this much detail, but we suspect that some players will be more of the 'reading' type since this is Harry Potter.  We're aiming at giving each type of player something for them to have.

    <desc>Pale-blue walls and floor make this room light and simple.  The 
cream-coloured ceiling fits into the ensemble like a cloud in the sky.  
Seven small cots with light blue sheets and white pillows rest along the 
florally-decorated walls.  The whole room smells of fresh, wild flowers and 
big, open fields.  At the northern end of the room are two rows of shelves 
that hold a number of varying objects.  These include potions, metal 
contraptions, wands, towels, and bottles of not-so-good-looking liquids.  
Above each cot is a classic-style sconce that emits a dull light over the

    <editeds>ECHOES:
 
1. Echo number 0 is slightly muddled. I've edited it slightly and added something to it for this reason: your echo has a frequency of 10. If every six minutes a bottle fell from the shelves there would be a huge mess here. If you don't like the part between brackets, however, feel free to remove it.
 
Edited echo: &quot;One of the potion vials tips over and falls from the shelves. (The mess shrieks as it boils on the floor, leaving no traces behind.)&quot;
 
Aside from that, no comments. This room is golden. `-Cristina

    <editfirstcomments>This room is very well written, dear Kyle; there is hardly anything that I had to change. I only changed one more major point, namely the description of your exit. Of course, you are free to change it if you didn't imagine it as a flight of stairs, but if you do change it, please let me know. 
 
As a second comment, please format your descs by pressing .w after you've entered the text.
 
Please also remember to change the titles of your rooms according to the new editing system. Every written room should have the title 'Drafted &lt;title&gt;' and every edited room whose edits have been implemented should have the title '* &lt;title&gt;'
 
A last thing: please remember to work with the new editing system, by placing your draft in the draft compartment. Please type view help to jog your memory about the new editing system, and here's two links that might help: http://lumos.mugglenet.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=7086 and http://lumos.mugglenet.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=7705. The second link represents the protocol of the new editing system.
 
Thank you very much for the hard work, and this is a very good room, Kyle! `-Cristina

    <desc>The gentle curve of the yellow sandstone wall encircling this room is echoed 
in miniature by the polished birch handrail of the ascending spiral 
staircase in the precise centre of the space.  The birch-wood floor radiates 
from the base of the stairs in variegated rays of gold and straw.  Arching 
rugs of creamy wool soften the gentle undulations of the worn wood.  A third 
of the room is given over to a wedge-shaped kitchen.  Curving counters 
follow the arc of the outer wall, their surfaces formed of mirror-smooth 
Brazilian granite, the umber-and-cream stone flecked here and there with 
black.  A deep sink sits next to a gas range, both enfolded by blonde wood 
cabinetry.  The remainder of the room is home to a dining area, dominated by 
a curved table.  The blue-painted door to the west leads outside, and a 
smaller, canary-coloured door leads east.  Overhead, the floor joists 
supporting the next level are plainly visible; from them hang oil lamps, 
shedding an aureate glow around the room.

almost-imperceptible camber.  Fitted together with great precision, it 
requires a close examination to distinguish the separate chunks of gritty 
stone, laid in a single course, spiraling upwards in an ever-tightening 
orbit around the stairwell.  Even the windows follow the same arc, their 
deep sills indicating that the walls are a foot thick.

    <desc>A quiet stream cuts through this small, grassy area, its serpentine flow 
dividing two different banks.  The southern bank is a wide yard, with a 
stone bench standing in the middle, and the northern side includes a 
rounding wall of thick oaks and lanky willows.  Its roots deeply embedded by 
the river side, a single willow stands apart from the group, dancing in 
waves of golden locks.  The seasonal, dark-green grass underfoot lies open 
beneath the heavens, eager to receive any hint of light against its blades.  
The smooth, central bench is inviting, eager to be of use to any passers-by. 
 The seasonally-leafy branches of the tall oaks are thick and brown, all of 
them reaching towards the sky above.  The saggy branches on the willows 
droop down to the ground below and the trunk is barely visible through them. 
 There is one exit leading south, into the Running Mill residence.

    <desc>This round room is cosily furnished, with fluffy ruby rugs brightening the 
walnut-stained floor.  All coffee-coloured leather and carved wood the shade 
of bittersweet chocolate, the somber tone of the furnishings are leavened by 
the red-brick hearth on the south wall and an abundance of crimson blankets 
and wall hangings.  The yellow-sandstone walls are dotted with circular 
windows, their sills carved in complex patterns.  Waist-high bookshelves 
ring the room, their shelves overflowing and their top surfaces stacked with 
leather-bound volumes.  A spiral staircase leads both up and down.  Though 
the handrail and steps here are made of dark-stained oak, near the level of 
the floor, the dark handrail dovetails smoothly into a piece of blonde 
birch; where the stairs lead past the ceiling, a glimpse of paler wood is 
also visible.  Reading lamps, their shades glowing a rich scarlet, rest on 
any flat surface unoccupied by books.

is propped up next to 'A History of Great Scottish Witches'.  Smaller books 
are stacked two deep.  Oversize tomes are piled atop the bookshelves; those 
that simply don't fit are relegated to mounds scattered about the floor.

circling the spiral staircase that leads down through the centre of the 
floor is made of the same material.  The planks making up the ceiling are 
painted a soft sky-blue.  Wooly, white sheepskin rugs on the floor stand in 
for drifting clouds; amidst the fluffy rugs stand heaps of books.  The 
furniture here is all painted to match the ceiling, though the frame of the 
enormous bed is concealed beneath billowy blue coverlets.  Casement windows, 
frames and mullions also blue, mark the major compass points.  An oil lamp 
of blue glass hangs from the ceiling, lending an azure glow to the space.  
The coarse surface of the stone walls is gentled by a coat of cerulean 
paint.

the north side of the room, a writing desk, obviously intended for the 
convenience of a secretary, huddles under a gilt-framed mirror.  Each wall

musty, mutated entanglements of bushes and rope-hard ivy.  Besides the 
heavy, sweet scent of decay, the air is filled with the frozen solemnity of 
the silence of death, which lingers thickly, as though glued to the very 
walls of the northern manor.  The vines that cover the house hungrily, 
rushing in from all possible angles, have spared only a small, squared 
window; dust, however, has not been as merciful.  Inch thick grime covers 
the glass; one can only imagine how little light might sift inside to what 
could be the kitchen.  A single door, small and completely covered by ivy 
and what appears to be years' worth of grime, peeks to the north along a 
wall so scarred with time that it looks positively hideous.

west and strong, dark oaks to the east.  Rising to the south in intricate, 
angry patterns are tall bushes, entangled with ivy and covered with a thin 
curtain of needles and thorns.  The dirty lane is overcrowded with streaks 
of grass and a thin layer of dust is scattered over dark-brown soil.  The 
sounds of life are tantalizing, coming from beyond the nearby willows, but 
there is no way of directly crossing westward and the vision is completely 
obscured by thick trunks and steadfast, high bushes.  A shack, made of 
dull-grey granite, can be glimpsed in the distance.  A thick scent of 
wilderness lingers in the fresh air.  Any light is obstructed by

    <desc>. Tall, mourning willows, streaked with strong oaks, border the 
nearly-inaccessible path to the northwest and to the east.  A labyrinth of 
thorny, dark-green bushes, tinselled with savage, lethal-looking ivy, crawls 
over the thin lane from all sides, giving it the appearance of a wilderness 
and neglect.  Aromas of sweet willow-bark mingle in the air with the 
powerful freshness of the surrounding weeds.  Grass and strange plants grow 
at the edges of the lane, in the shadows of trees or bushes, completing a 
strange botanical exhibition.  To the east, amidst the curtain of willows, 
the vaguest contour of a granite wall can be seen, while to the south, 
inaccessible but everlasting, stretches.  The thick branches of the nearby 
oaks arch overhead, diminishing daylight to a faint candle-like 
illumination.  During the evening, all lights fade into a strange, 
uncomfortable darkness.  Strangled amidst the savage overgrowth, the pathway 
turns east and west, dark and mysterious.

      <desc>. The vines of silvery, thick ivy are stretched over the ground, rising 
against the firm bodies of any bushes or trees in a lover's embrace.  Hungry 
fingers push against any, small opening, completely invading the space they 
are given.  Their leaves are long and grow thickly together, long needles 
perched at the end of every leaf.  Both during the night and in daytime they 
keep throbbing and pulsating in a wild rhythm of life and passion.

      <desc>. The willows lining the path on both sides are old and well-worn by time and 
weather, but they stand strong and tall.  Their trunks are unblemished and, 
unlike those of the nearby oaks, they have not been twisted or broken by the 
force of nature.  Elastic and permanently mourning, they caress the ground 
in sweeping motions of their long arms and fingers.  Some of their branches 
are draped around neighbouring bushes, sliding atop them like languorous 
rivers of gold and green.

    <desc>. A pathway slithers, hidden between a row of mourning willow to the south 
and strong, dark oaks to the north.  Rising to the south in intricate, angry 
patterns are tall bushes, entangled with ivy and covered with a thin curtain 
of needles and thorns.  The dirty lane is overcrowded with streaks of grass 
and a thin layer of dust is scattered over dark-brown soil.  The sounds of 
life are tantalizing, coming from beyond the nearby willows, but there is no 
way of directly crossing westward and the vision is completely obscured by 
thick trunks and steadfast, high bushes.  A shack, made of dull-grey 
granite, can be glimpsed neighbouring the oaks.  A thick scent of wilderness 
lingers in the fresh air.  Any light is obstructed by heavily-laden 
branches, draped like arches above the path.

    <desc>Wedged behind a few gnarled oak trees and a line of scrubby brush, this 
weed-tangled area is more of a clearing than a true garden.  A vegetable 
patch of sorts has been hacked out of the sod; a few spindly potato plants 
struggle to survive amidst the clods and rocks.  To the west, beyond the 
trees, a path wends out of view.  An inexpertly-constructed shack to the 
east resembles a heap of rough granite more than a real house.  It's clear 
that an effort has been made; the tarp roof is securely lashed down, and a 
fifty-gallon drum, currently half-full of scummy water, has been set beneath 
the eaves to catch runoff.  A disassembled packing crate serves as a door to 
the rickety structure.

    <desc>With a packed-earth floor and a dun canvas tarp for a roof, this structure 
is by no means luxurious.  Walls of stacked granite depend on gravity, moss, 
and a bit of luck; no mortar was used in their inexpert construction and 
both wind and light pass through the racks unimpeded.  The western door is 
painstakingly constructed of an old packing case, and is a reasonable 
approximation of a rectangle.  The eastern door is little more than a flap 
of khaki canvas, the bottom weighted with heavy sticks shoved through a 
makeshift hem.  A few candle stubs, perched on protrusions of stone, 
supplement any light leaking in through the chinks and gaps.

western shack.  The only exit is a canvas flap covering an opening in the 
ramshackle dwelling's stone wall.  The majority of the space is occupied by 
a deep pool of clear water; a submerged shelf of dark-speckled granite along 
one edge allows for wading in the chilly pond.  More chunks of the speckled 
rock are scattered through the space, many large enough to serve as chairs.  
A fire-ring has been assembled of smaller stones, the ground beneath 
carefully cleared of vegetation.

    <editdraft>This shop traces the vague shape of a cat's head with the main, southern 
door below two, small windows that might be its nostrils.  The walls and 
floor are thick with soft fur of a playful, ginger colour; this makeshift 
carpet meticulously passes under a veritable cornucopia of beasts scattered 
everywhere.  Lamps are placed like a crown at the junction of the walls and 
ceiling, shedding a soothing, orange light.  The massive ceiling is 
irregularly shaped, with cages and open nests of birds decorating two, 
ear-shaped alcoves.  The rounded head is shorter than it is wide, with four 
whiskers on each side.  These hold all sorts of rodents, rabbits, fish, 
snakes, spiders, and lizards imaginable.  In the main compartment of the 
store is a round, wooden counter, with cats and cat houses and labyrinths to 
the east side and all sorts of dogs with corresponding toys and baskets 
comfortably stretched to the west.  At the opposite end of the store, below 
a portrait of an aging, grinning man is a small, brown door.

    <editeds>Hahaha.  Your second echo made me actually laugh out loud!  :D and I'm sure 
the first one is about YOUR cat :D I've edited only your dogs and cats ed.

    <editsecond>This is a delightful room!!  :) Okay, what needs to be changed since this is 
a pet shop.  1, just a preference thing on my part about the parrot echo, 
but isn't croak usually left to frogs, toads, and humans with sore throats?  
Wouldn't a 'squawk' be more along the lines of a parrot?  Okay, 2 will be a 
bit extensive.  This is a pet store so many of your eds need to be actual 
objs.  The portrait (and there can be echoes of him saying things or moving, 
but it needs to be physical) &amp; counter need to be objs, especially since the 
pet store owner will be behind the counter.  Next, you need to pull back on 
the many types of animals you've described in these.  You have 9 dog types 
in this store.  One of which is a lone Komondor puppy, which means that the 
first person who buys this dog is the only one who gets one, yet the puppy 
will still be in the ed.  There are 6 different types of cats plus &quot;many&quot; 
1/2-breeds.  There are 7 specifically mentioned animals in the whiskers ed, 
plus tons of general ones like rodents, spiders, insects, etc.  There are 
specifically 6 bird types mentioned, plus the addition of a multitude of 
varying coloured creatures, and there's a goat.  Just specifically mentioned 
items # over 30 and that's without making the 'many different types'.  Next, 
you have descs of all sorts of cages, baskets, toys, etc.  All these items 
mentioned have to now be available for sell.  However, if you buy a pet, you 
don't need these items as the pet 'stays' with you.  Add things in that make 
the reader understand these items stay in the shop.  For example, the cat 
cages or labyrinths, etc, are built into the wall of the shop.  Or the cages 
'house' these animals.  Since we can't really sell fish as a pet, we can 
either make the aquarium, with the 'fish' inside, as an object that the 
players can carry with them to set somewhere or you can just say the fish 
are 'on display'.  Insects as mobiles...  That sort of scares me, but if you 
can think of a few that you think are needed, make 'em and I'll stick them 
in.  For every type of animal we create we have to put it on a list of items 
that can be sold and their worth.  Just pull back many of these so we don't 
kill ourselves on this shop alone.  =) Thank you sooo much!!

The store has lazy, luxurious Persians, distant Siamese, fluffy Burmese, sly 
Nowegian Forest cats, British Shorthairs, tabbies, and all sort of 
half-breeds.  While some prefer to spend most of their times hidden away in 
their colourful houses, others enjoy quarrelling with each other, making 
their toilette in plain view of any passers-by, or regarding the world with 
a self-satisfied countenance.

    <desc>This roughly-spherical chamber is lined with a thick, bristly layer of 
glowing coral, rendering the water-filled room as bright as a sunny noonday 
in June.  The light brings no daylight warmth, however, and the crystal-pure 
water remains at a temperature more reminiscent of a January midnight.  An 
inverse moon sits in the center of the ceiling; this dark circle marks an 
exit to the dimly-lit waters above.  Almost concealed in the glare from the 
walls is another passageway, this one so thick with coral that there is 
barely room for an adult to swim along without scraping against the sharp, 
grasping fingers of the coral.

      <desc>The twisted branches of the coral reach in towards the center of the room, 
each with as many razor-sharp surfaces as a meat-grinder.  Each tree-like 
structure is a foot tall, and emits a thin, golden light.  The vast numbers 
of coral branches here multiply the light to the level of a cool, inverted 
sun.

    <desc>The walls of this curving tunnel are thickly carpeted with bioluminescent 
coral like a shag rug woven from glowing razorblades.  There is just enough 
room for an adult to swim down the centre of the culvert-round passage 
without encountering the meat-grinder surfaces of the coral branches.  
Despite the intense, lemon-yellow light, the flooded tunnel is cold as a 
polar midnight; the unnatural stillness of the water seems to increase the 
oppressive chill.  From this point, the tunnel leads off to the northwest 
and southwest, but all that can be seen in either direction is more coral 
and more clear, icy water.

of a porcelain fruit bowl, gives way to rougher, darker granite about 
halfway up to the water's shimmering surface above.  Here and there, the 
dusky stone shows chisel marks and semi-circular dings the size of a 
rock-hammer's head.  To the southeast, a glowing tunnel opening shines like 
a spotlight, casting an aureate ring of light on the opposite wall, 
highlighting a round patch of greenish slime.  From above, a ruddy, 
flickering light, distorted from passing through the water, adds 
illumination to the otherwise-dim place.

    <desc>A deep, round well of diamond-clear, icy water occupies the south end of 
this ovoid room.  The curved walls bear torches at regular intervals; though 
there is no scent of pitch or smoke, the light flickers and dances in the 
still air.  Three, broad, shallow steps ring the water's edge; the stone is 
deeply scored in a wave pattern to prevent wet feet from slipping on the 
polished granite.  Though, once, they may have been intended to rise out of 
the water, they are now beneath the unrippled surface.  The stairs lead to 
carved walls to the south, east, and west, but to the north, they lead out 
of the lake onto a broad ledge, itself submerged.  Three, stone doors stand 
across from the pool; formed of unadorned, polished stone, they gleam 
greenly in the unsteady light.  The jade doors lead northeast, north, and 
northwest; the only other exit from this chamber is back down into the cold 
water.

    <desc>This octagonal room is floored in dark grey marble, polished to a mirror 
sheen.  The veining is vaguely reminiscent of rippling grass, viewed under 
the blanching light of a winter moon.  The walls and domed ceiling are 
constructed in matte, black rock, soft to the touch, like unpolished 
soapstone.  Embedded in the stone are thousands of precious stones, ranging 
in size from an emerald the size of a pigeon's egg to hundreds of diamonds 
almost too small to see.  Torches are mounted on the walls and ceiling at 
seemingly-random locations, each marked with a different symbol, and burning 
with a steady, unflickering light.  In the centre of the floor, a cluster of 
orbs made from volcanic glass form a platform for a large chest.  To the 
south, a jade door inlaid with twisting paths of milky opal provides the 
only visible exit.

obscure, but clearly visible overhead are the familiar forms of Ursa Major 
and Cassiopeia, providing a clue to the nature of the decoration; this room 
is an accurate rendition of the night sky, with the torches serving to 
represent the planets.

    <desc>This chamber is roughly round, with walls stretching up to an 
irregularly-domed ceiling overhead.  All surfaces in the room are made of 
faceted quartz crystal, as clear as spring water.  Torch flames burn in 
cunningly-carved sockets in the shaped stone, flickering cheerfully without 
the benefit of fuel.  Magnified by the reflective stone, the small flames 
are multiplied and amplified, giving the impression that the entire room, 
from the uneven floor to the crystal spars on the ceiling, is wreathed in 
flame.  Spiking up from the floor in the middle of the chamber is a pedestal 
formed of six-sided fingers of crystal as thick as a man's thigh, clumped in 
a broad ovoid roughly waist-high.  Torch flames on each narrow end give the 
structure the look of a low bonfire.  Atop the licking light, like a roast 
on the cooking fire, sits a chest.  To the southwest, a jade door, carved in 
leaping, twisting flames, offers the only relief from the colours of flame 
and the only visible exit from this space.

    <desc>Twenty feet in diameter and roughly circular, this room resembles a grove of 
carved, stone, oak trees.  Overhead, carved branches arch, budded out with 
thin flakes of jade carved cunningly into oak leaves, complete with raised 
veins.  The carved bark on the trunks forming the walls is shaggy, with 
long, vertical furrows of dark grey stone, as pebbly under the fingertips as 
true oak bark, but colder.  The floor appears at first glance to be 
moss-covered loam, buckled by roots straining from below.  On closer 
examination, it is green-dyed coral, the porous surface hard and unforgiving 
to bare feet.  The room is lit by flickering torches banded to the 
'branches' with metal straps; the torches are formed of wrought-iron, 
decorated in firefly motifs.  In the center of the floor sits a stump, three 
feet across and two feet high, the smooth top showing growth rings in a 
hundred variations of brown.  Atop this platform sits a chest.

above.  In the upper reaches of the room, a jet-eyed squirrel, carved from 
the same, living rock as the trees, peers down at the chest below.

underground lake like the crook of a corpse's neck.  Silent, deep water 
stretches from the limestone waves frozen in the vertical surface extending 
north and east, out into the vast darkness in the northeast.  Anyone willing 
to slip beneath the surface could move down into the depths of the lake and 
the freezing dimness there.  Overhead, all but lost in the shadowy upper 
reaches of the cavern, are vast and convoluted formations born of water and 
rock.  Without the heartbeat of waves against a shore, indeed, without a 
visible shore at all, this chamber is still as death; chilling, still air, 
laden with damp seems to resist such mundane abuses as breath.

cavern extends north and south, the bulging, wavy surface declaring by its 
satin-smooth irregularity its defiance of humankind's obsession with right 
angles.  To the northeast, east, and southeast, the vast darkness of a 
shoreless, sunless lake lies in state, occupying the grand and terrible 
cavern.  An echo of the motionless waters below, the undisturbed air, heavy 
with moisture and silence, sits in ominous stillness.  High overhead, pallid 
formations of crinkled stone and dagger-pointed rock cast unrelenting 
shadows in any light that presents itself.  Though there is no hope of 
scaling the slick, wet walls above, one could brave the icy grip of the 
water and slip below the surface.

    <desc>Falling from the angled, abrupt, mutilated vastness of the above ceiling, a 
surrounding wall falls into wet, unassailable slickness, enclosing around 
the waters of a lake.  The surface of the water, frozen in a forced 
stillness, extends east, southeast, and south, uniform in its terrible 
majesty; it betrays nothing of the persistent cruelty that must have 
smoothed the walls and eaten the northwestern corner in a pained, hollow 
gap.  Devoid of any sound, the cavern is filled with an echoing silence, 
holding the unspoken pain, anger, and joy of years, decades, or centuries.  
Timeless, frozen in its own, undying beauty, this cave is utterly, utterly 
dead, devoid of anything that might mean life; the lake itself is dense and 
cold beyond belief, a fluid corpse in a watery tomb.  From beneath, the 
depths dispassionately, silently call, immutable and endless.

    <desc>The majesty of the twisting, convoluted cavern hangs above the lake like a 
curse; even its immutable glory, however, has been tamed to smooth slickness 
on the walls surrounding this water.  To the northeast, north, northwest, 
and east stands only the dense thickness of the defeated rock, pallid and 
left without even the smallest abrasion.  In all other directions spreads 
only steel-grey, endless, quiet water.  Time is irrelevant here, counted 
only in the painfully-slow increase in the width of the lake and in the 
minute crumbling of the ageless stone.  The surface of the water is 
unbearably still, as though its liquid grace were no more than a well-made 
glass pane, too dense to storm or writhe in fierce exaltation.  No emotion 
stirs the lake as it stands, frozen in the passage of time, maddeningly 
patient and calm in dispassionate death.  Like a magnificent tormentor with 
a frozen smile, the depths away those brave enough to chance them.

floor there is littered with pale, knobby debris, almost choking the ivory 
light emitted by the coral.  Overhead, the impassive surface of the water 
lies unruffled in lifeless serenity.

    <desc>This submerged cul-de-sac is a frozen of deep shadows and pale, jaundiced 
light.  Luminescent, freshwater coral juts and twists through a tangle of 
chalky rods and spokes, interspersed with the occasional, lopsided orb.  To 
the south, the ashen surface of the cavern wall stretches out into the 
distance.  The eastern wall of this little side-chamber is not far away; to 
the southeast, across the jumble on the floor, spreads the bulk of the 
underwater landscape.  The walls curl upwards like the interior of an 
enormous skull until they intersect the immutable silver of the surface.

    <desc>This subaqueous, limestone antechamber resembles a pallid, lifeless womb.  
Rather than warm, new life, this bloodless, pallid chamber contains a 
cluttered heap of ivory-coloured sticks and lumps, nearly swamping the 
luminescent coral that provides weak, jaundiced illumination to the lakebed. 
 Sharp, surrealistic shadows jut in magnified mockery of the shapes piled 
over the bioluminescent encrustations.  Rather than the sweet, slick taste 
it carries in the rest of the lake, the water here has a darker, earthier 
flavour, lingering at the back of the tongue like mushrooms.  The frigid 
water extends out to the south and southwest, the smooth bottom of the 
watery cavern dotted with glowing coral.  Along the striated sweep of the 
wall, one can proceed to the west or southwest.

    <desc>The slick roundness of the walls gathering about this tiny opening would be 
reassuring were it not for their claustrophobic closeness.  Like the maw of 
an attacking amoeba, the ceiling hangs low above, at any moment threatening 
to enclose the whole of this gap into the predator's viscous body substance. 
 The waters of the lake are still and cold; magnificent and quiet, a cave 
opens around the steel-grey, immutable surface to the west and northwest.  
The walls around are unassailable; their surface is slippery and only 
slightly coarse around a two-inch deep gorge at the water level; the space 
between the lake and the too-near ceiling is crawling with silence-charged 
air.  Though the refraction of the surrounding walls tries to deny it, the 
opening is large enough to plunge deeper into the lake, for any brave enough 
to do so.

    <desc>Submerged beneath the icy, sweet-tasting water, this section of the cavern 
is bounded on three sides by the smooth, striated limestone walls, like the 
slick, cold interior of a giant fish.  The floor of the lake is studded with 
a lace-like growth of luminescent freshwater coral, providing a dim, aureate 
glow that permits a vague, dreamlike view of the submerged landscape.  
Unlike the involved and convoluted formations above the water's surface, the 
rock here is characterized by flowing surfaces coated with a colourless 
growth of algae.  A broken spar, evidently fallen from the cave roof high 
above, is partially-covered in the same luminous encrustation that dots the 
rest of the depths..  Overhead is the rippling darkness of the lake's 
surface.  To the north and northwest, the walls open out, providing access 
to more of the softly-glowing lakebed.

    <desc>A thick clump of oaks, seasonally wreathed in a knotted bunch of twigs and 
bushes, explodes in a very effective barrier to the south of this road.  The 
path is roughly crayoned by a line of crimson flowers during the warmer part 
of the year; the wilderness expands inaccessibly behind it, to the north, 
northeast, west, and northwest.  To the east, a deep ditch is perpetually 
filled with stale, but sweet-scented water; around it grow low, soft, pale 
herbs.  Cut in a sharp bend somewhat mellowed by the plants growing beside 
it, the little road streams into a comfortable, downhill slope to the 
southwest and slips into a street to the southeast.  The ground is dark and 
rich, buttery-soft on the surface, with small granules tracing chaotic 
patterns against a harder layer underneath; regardless of the season, the 
soil retains a vague, pleasant moisture.

    <desc>Buried amidst thick bushes and entangled with ivy and tree roots, a path of 
soft, dark, fresh dirt practically crashes down an incline to the west of 
this point.  The edges of the makeshift lane are nearly suffocated by a 
multitude of dark-coloured plants that are thriving in the shadow of many 
trees growing nearby.  To the south stretches an impenetrable barrier of 
oaks, streaked with tall, thorny bushes and tinselled with ivy; the 
combination bars any view to what lies beyond it.  Greedy, silvery vines of 
thick ivy crawl across the ground, rising against any obstacle they meet 
with the persistence of a lover.  A deep fragrance of moist earth rises from 
a northeastern incline; a few, roughly-shaped bumps could serve as steps in 
climbing this steep, slippery slope.  A strange, sweet scent lingers heavily 
in the air.

    <editfirstcomments>The desc is a bit long-ish here, though very lovely. I've added some commas here and there, tried to avoid the repetitions, and changed a colored to coloured.

of intricately-woven, evergreen plants.  The air is dense with the scent of 
moist, rich earth, and the gentle, rolling trickle of a stream sings from 
beyond a row of willows nearby.  To the northeast, a path winds up a 
slender, gentle slope; a stone bridge gracefully arches to the west above 
the water.  To the south, an oak thicket is streaked during the warmer part 
of the year with insistent, proud, rosewood trunks and branches, knitted 
together by thorny bushes and silvery ivy.  The road is clearly visible 
beneath a blanket of seasonal soft leaves that lend this passage a faint, 
picturesque aura.  The arms of nearby trees are thrown overhead in a 
protective bow that keeps any excessive light away; the gentle 
possessiveness of the trees twines their twigs around each other like

    <desc>Snowmelt-cold, even in the height of summer, this swift-flowing stream leaps 
and dances in from the north.  As it flows towards the south, its swift 
flight is slowed by a cluster of massive, black boulders, their surfaces 
glossy in the foaming spray.  Glimpses of the streambed, between streamers 
of bubbly upwelling foam, shows it to consist of tumbling, rounded, black 
rocks of all sizes.  The churning rapids are contained by high, rock-studded 
banks of dark clay-mud.  Tough strands of grassy weeds dot the slippery 
slopes.  Downstream, to the south, the low, wooden arch of a bridge is 
barely visible through the veiling branches of willow trees.

    <desc>A wooden bridge arches here between a sleepy, winding, southwestern path and 
an eastern streak of dark-coloured, ivy-covered earth.  A constant, roiling 
sound of exploding, roaring water stirs beneath this rustic construction.  
With overwhelming tenderness, willows hang heavily against high, 
unsophisticated, wooden handles; the seasonal thicket of golden-green, sweet 
scented, swaying dancers is utterly hypnotizing.  The stream below is 
accessible to the north and southeast for any brave enough to jump over the 
bridge, though the cataracts raging underneath speak of an unhealthy 
wildness and a terrible, vengeful freedom.  The solitary, small bridge is 
made of wide, wooden planks, laid next to each other and enforced by a thin, 
discreet, metallic frame.  Though eroded by time and enthusiastic 
passers-by, the wood keeps the vision of the crashing water firmly hidden 
beneath its steadfast build.

      <desc>The stream below the bridge is clear and explosively fresh, collapsing in 
determined, fast waves against an often-irregular bottom.  The water roars 
and screams in a general, southern direction, as it breaks against 
occasional, makeshift barriers of glistening, polished boulders.  Foam 
froths against the shore and occasional obstacles; with a fierce roar of 
freedom and supreme rage, the waves tumble one over the other in whirling 
dances of ethereal, ghostly visages.

    <desc>Wending its tranquil way between occasional large rocks, this stream is deep 
and quiet here, only the gentle gurgling of the flowing water disturbing the 
calm.  From atop the steep, muddy banks, the branches of varied trees bend 
low, providing a green roof in the growing season, and a brown, protective, 
wicker-work arch in the winter.  Oaks are the sentries, straight-backed, 
with limbs extended in strong salutes, forming an arch of honor over the 
water-carved gully that houses the stream.  Gleaming trunks of silver birch 
fill in the canopy overhead, twiggy branches shyly veiling the sky.  The 
long, flexible branches of willow trees trail languorously over the chilly 
surface, dabbling dreamily in the current, touching off tiny trails of 
diamond-patterned ripples.  Upstream, to the northwest, a glimpse of a low, 
wooden bridge is visible through the branches.  Downstream, the watercourse 
curves southwest cloaked by high, slick banks and caressing branches.

    <desc>Deep and nearly still on the surface, this stream flows down the center of a 
curving, steep-walled gorge ten feet deep.  The sides are near-vertical, and 
consist of slippery, dark clay, studded here and there with loosely-held 
rocks.  Atop the banks, trees crowd close, bending as if to gaze down into 
the water below.  Oaks tilt stately crowns, observing their reflections 
below; birches gather their dark twigs about their slender, silver forms, 
peering through bunched fingers at the gentle ripples in their shade.  The 
willows stoop low, trailing their long hair into the running water, causing 
long, delicate wakes.  The current originates around a bend, to the 
northeast, and sweeps off towards the west.

    <desc>The near-vertical banks of the stream widen here, and the watercourse widens 
with them, widens and deepens into a slow-moving pool; the incoming flow 
from the east is diverted into lazy eddies along each side of the basin, 
plucking at grains of sand from the pool's bottom.  Easily visible through 
fifteen feet of water as clear as a spring dawn, the bottom is dotted with 
large rocks and fallen tree limbs.  In the west, a steady rush of cold water 
hurries swiftly out, scampering over polished pebbles with a sound 
reminiscent of icy laughter.  The slippery clay cliffs extend as far above 
the water's surface as they do below.  Trees line the edges far overhead; 
broad, oak limbs span the gap, all but blocking out the view of the sky.  
Shy willow trees bend over the water, their swaying branches, like maiden's 
hair, hang past their feet, though the tips brush empty air high above the 
pool.

    <desc>The streambed is wide here, the water no deeper than two feet.  On either 
side, slippery walls of damp clay rise in unscalable, crumbling ochre 
barriers; the top of the embankments slope significantly, dropping closer to 
the stream as the gully follows the water's chatter, curving into the 
northwest.  Willow branches dangle into the miniature canyon, trailing 
lazily in the air, high above the water.  Silver birches rustle their long, 
delicate branches like nervous fingers above their stooping willow sisters.  
Stalwart oaks arch over the others, protective branches embracing the more 
delicate trees.  The waters fill the bottom of the ravine, moving with such 
speed that walking upright is nearly impossible.  Leaping, trout-like, to 
clear submerged rocks, the gleaming surface of the icy stream dances and 
ripples like living glass.  The water is never silent, from the roar of the 
constant flow to the east to the cheerful gurgling where the flow tugs at 
its clay boundaries.  A swimmer could head upstream to the east and the deep 
pool there, or brave the shallow, but swift, watercourse to the northwest.

    <desc>Cheerful and constant, the murmur of a small watercourse fills the air, 
accompanied by the moist, earthy scent of wet clay and the richly organic 
aroma of sodden plant matter.  At this point, the high banks of the stream 
take on a gentler slope, allowing a path to approach right to the water's 
edge.  A ragged group of broad, flat rocks, their edges thickly furred with 
soft, damp moss, span the flowing water.  Though there are deep channels 
interspersed with shallow, pebbly sections of the streambed, a careful 
traveller could easily move dry-shod from one bank to the other by hopping 
from rock to rock.  The stream emerges from a tall, enclosing gully to the 
southeast, flowing on to the northwest, where high banks again rise on 
either side of it.  The stony pathway extends to the west and to the 
southwest, the trees lining the narrow way blocking the view beyond a dozen 
yards.

heavy rocks that break its smooth surface.  Lacing and twining around the 
obstacles like translucent, nervous fingers, the stream plucks and worms its 
way through the narrowest of gaps.  Here and there, a probing tendril of 
water will strike a dead end, sending up a continuous, fine plume of spray.  
In the perpetually dampened spot adjacent to such a plume, emerald-green 
moss studded with diamond-bright droplets grows as thickly as a velvet 
carpet.

shallow enough to wade, if one could keep to the largest of the submerged 
rocks.  Clearly visible through the pure clarity of the water, the dark, 
faceted surfaces of the stones harbour a crop of algae, the long, 
slime-green tendrils waving in the current.  Slippery banks rise six feet

edges are lined so thickly with tree trunks and brambles that they form an 
impenetrable barrier.

    <desc>The clay banks enfolding the watercourse back towards the east give way to 
solid, dark-grey stone.  The steep, ropey cliffs hedge the water into 
ever-narrowing confines.  Bubbling and frothing as it encounters an array of 
jutting rocks, the formerly-calm stream becomes a swirling, chaotic 
maelstrom.  Amidst the miniature whirlpools and turbulent current, it is not 
immediately obvious where the flow begins to lessen-, but lessen it does.  
Though the walls crowd closer and closer, the water grows shallower, until 
the remains of the stream plunge down into a cleft in the rock with a 
continuous hollow roar.  A determined swimmer could follow the cascade, 
wriggling down through the confining, rocky maw into the dark below.  A more 
sensible traveler might opt to swim back to the east, to smoother waters and 
open air.

    <editsecondcomments>***tina's comments: I changed 'most of which veiled and lightless' since 
it's a phrase demanding a verb, or changed into a completely adjectival 
phrase for windows, which is the route I went.  I'll be honest; a part of me 
wanted to leave the white tile floor part as was since it's so damned 
poetic.  But, with the ; added by the lovely C, I did.  At that point it is 
no longer a sentence used with a grammatically incorrect, but poetic devise, 
but just plain jumbled.  Now, I hope, I've kept the poetry in its original 
form while maintaining proper grammar.  :) I changed the aisle between each 
side as you didn't set up that there are 2 rows of cots on the walls.  Also, 
since Kyle was the original writer, technically we should have his rooms in 
here.  Dan, yours as the '1st' edit, Cris as 2nd editor, I'll be 3rd editor 
and stick it in the desc.  I changed it accordingly, hence my putting my 
comments in the 2nd edit areasince I don't have one.  :) (Oh, and if anyone 
despises any changes I make when stuck in the desc, change it and send a 
note to us.)

passing through here.  Massive boughs of oaks and rosewood trees unite 
overhead, their branches outstretched in a massive embrace that keeps away 
any occasional light.  A musky scent of damp plants mixes in the air with 
the seasonal sweetness of fresh leaves.  The lane is smooth, with weeds and 
bushes crawling onto it from its sides, tainted with thickly-woven webs of 
ivy.  To the east and south, whispering even in the absence of any wind, are 
rich, inaccessible, magnificent willows, whose branches fall in waves upon 
waves against the nearby plants.  The rapid trickle of water echoes 
tantalizingly from all directions.  A hint of a wooden construction is 
visible to the northeast, between the low branches of the nearby willows; 
from here, the path struggles up a western slope.

    <desc>A path, broad enough for a single person to walk on, rises up a steep slope 
from the east to the west.  Tall oaks grow on either side of this lane, 
throwing their arms towards each other in large, thick archways, adorned, in 
season, with dark-green leaves.  The web of branches overhead is so thick 
that very little, if any, light penetrates through.  Thorny, evergreen 
hedges, with heights ranging between one and three feet, stretch between the 
trees, their dark colours mixing with the silvery tinge of a web of ivy.  
During the warmer part of the year, the scent of fresh grass is light in the 
air, mixed with the faint aroma of damp, sweet bark.  There are a few 
willows to the south, their graceful branches falling in seasonally-golden, 
swaying waves above the nearby bushes; all around, echoing through the 
thicket, is the sound of rapidly churning water.

gentle dance that slows, but never ceases, in the absence of the wind.  
Amidst this wall of noble, languid forms, one stands out.  A few of its 
branches are gone and there is an angry gash in its side, red-rimmed and 
deep.

    <desc>Collapsing downward from the south, this stony, overgrown track meanders 
somewhat the northeast; the dulcet, musical tones of a babbling brook can be 
heard from that direction.  The railings that line the path on both sides 
are set there more for decoration than in the interest of safety.  A few 
wood fragments and splinters litter the sides of the path here; some are 
covered in moss and grey mushrooms, having already started to decompose.  
Scattered beside the road lie several stone formations, their pebbly 
surfaces an eclectic mix of dull-greens, greys, and tawny browns.  Ivy and 
moss carpet the hill beneath towering, old oaks; their scents mix with the 
perfume of damp earth and sweet rot.  On the crown of the hill, barely 
visible between tree branches and seasonal leaves, rises the faint 
silhouette of a manor house.

    <editdraft>Meandering downward from the south, this stony and overgrown track descends 
rapidly, turning to the northeast, from which the dulcet and musical tones 
of a babbling brook can be heard.  Railings line the path on both sides 
intricate carvings, though worn down by the elements and lack of upkeep, are 
at the top of the railing, becoming less adorned as the steps descend from 
the hill, ending in plain pieces of smooth wood.  Parts of the woodwork have 
been knocked down onto the sides of the path, a few of which have started to 
decompose.  Moss grows abundantly over these fallen pieces, as well as 
clusters of grayish mushrooms.  Scattered along the side of the track on the 
hill lie several stone formations, their pebbly surfaces an eclectic mix of 
dull greens, grays and tawny browns.  Strands of ivy and plenty of moss 
cover the grounds of the hill, adding to the scent of moist wet earth and 
decomposing organic matter.  Several large oaks tower over the trail, 
blocking any view of the manor up the hill save for slight glances through 
the branches.

      <desc>The railings at the side of the path are made of sturdy wood.  Intricate 
carvings, somewhat worn by the elements and lack of upkeep, adorn these 
railings, becoming increasingly less complicated down the slope.  At the 
bottom, the decorations are mere planks of wood; the wooden surfaces are 
mostly smooth, though small fragments and splinters are littered randomly 
all around them.

    <desc>Steep, muddy banks dotted with wiry, shallow-rooted weeds slope down to this 
clear stream.  The surface ripples and bubbles with the force of the water 
leaping and dancing down from the north; the rocks there are too steep and 
slick to scale, and the water, rushing in from the hills that rise to meet 
the northern horizon batters at anyone who dares try.  As it flows 
southwards, the flow smoothes and settles into a calm surface ten feet above 
the black rock of the streambed.  Icy even in the heat of summer, the water 
moves relentlessly to the south, tugging anything in its grasp in the same 
direction.  Indeed, south seems the only choice for travel; the high banks 
bar the east and west, and the precipitous climb to the north is 
unthinkable.

water from the north.  The slick, slate-grey soil is studded with rounded, 
black rocks, ranging from pea-sized pebbles to smooth hunks of stone the 
size of a human head.  Long, tough plant stems, topped with narrow tufts of 
leaves, grow in small clumps on the steep banks, their shallow root systems 
visible through a thin coating of wet earth.

    <desc>A strong, sickly-sweet scent of damp, rotting plants hangs thickly in the 
air, coiled around slithering, knotted plants, that stretch in all 
directions.  Like an ugly, knife wound, the path bleeds north and southwest, 
through a gate; its unsteady, dark-grey flow is bordered by bushes in 
decaying hues of brown and yellow.  To the east and west, trees cluster 
against one another, their branches arching overhead in webs of 
painfully-tight knots; finding a way between them is an impossible task.  
The intertwined claws of the arching copse break up any sunlight attempting 
to pass through.  What feeble rays touch the ground are no more intense than 
a dismal echo of moonlight on a cloudy sky.  Clumps of moss and ivy overrun 
the bumpy ground, clinging with feverish eagerness to the trunks of heavy 
oaks.  The enveloping gloom throws unsettling shadows across the small, 
crippled lane.

      <description>This three-foot-tall gateway might have once been bright-white, but the 
colour must have disappeared some years ago.  What stands now between this 
weed-infested path and the concrete drive beyond it looks more like a 
carved, crumbling, thin sheet of wood, eaten away by rain and cold.  A rusty 
latch that looks as though it could be opened with a good deal of effort 
rests on the right side of the gate.  All around the gate, weeds grown 
hatefully close, as though attempting to block this route out.

    <desc>Beds, each covered by a chocolate brown duvet and a fluffy a white pillow, line the east and west walls of this large room.  Long, forest green curtains flow from the ceiling, granting each bed privacy.  The walls and floor are earthy colours, manifolds of browns and greens.  A glass chandelier, intricately designed with fire-polished fan leaves, hangs in the centre of the room, delivering light to all below it.  A roomy, padded cage sits in the northeast corner, looking rather deteriorated.  Upon the walls inside the enclosure are deep scratch marks and spots of dried blood.  A small, willow desk lies at the northern end of the room, atop of which are many bottles and glasses filled with clear liquid. Additional cisterns of liquid, as well as supplementary supplies, are assembled on a set of shelves upon the southern wall.  There is one exit, leading to the southern corridor.

    <editdraftcomments>Kyle, here's notes on my changes: 1, comforter is more of an American word.  The Brits usually use blankets, bedspreads, duvets, quilts, coverlets, etc..  If you're running out of words from all the blankets throughout the hospital, don't worry about it.  2, if each bed is covered, shouldn't it be coveed from view by large, green curtains and not one single curtain.  I don't think it makes much sense.  3, center should be the British centre.  4, you have 'ceiling' twice within 2 sentences.  5, you used cage within 2 subsequent sentences when there are tons of other words that mean cage. 6, try not to use 'also' a lot in descs, especially as a lead word.  We use 'as well as' a lot, and also can be used sparingly, though it shouldn't lead a sentence.  Since you're wanting to convey that the shelves hold 
supplies as does the desk I'd either keep the desk sentence simple and marry the other 2 ideas, or take away any 'also' idea and let it stand alone. 7,  you have a great idea for how rooms should look, you just need to become more poetic and descriptive in describing the pictures in your head.  You have a gift for language; I think you need to learn to tweak that for your rooms now.  Stories are actually easier than writing descs.  You have space and elbow room to explain things and be descriptive.  In descs you have 6-12 sentences to make things as visual and pithy as you can.  I know you have the ability as you're seeing the picture in your head.  Just take that picture and look at it more closely.  Don't just describe the general idea of the room, but give us its flavor so we can taste it.  I just spiced things up a bit.  =)

    <editeds>Echo 0: The cage in the corner suddenly cracks, the door swings open slowly, and the hinges creak loudly.  *the cracks and creak are basically the same thing, unless you mean that the door cracks open.  This makes it confusing.  Also, we know the cage is in the corner from the desc.  Instead say something like, &quot;As the door to the cage slowly cracks open, its oxidized hinges creak loudly.&quot;

    <desc>The most striking thing about this room is the sharpness of all the edges.  
Parallelepiped-shaped filing cabinets that were once white, but have now 
turned a light shade of grey stand, perfectly aligned, to the east.  Great 
care has been put into arranging all the stubborn, rusty, and old drawers at 
the same level; safely fastened to the grey metal, the labelling is crisp, 
in a very sure hand, Z to A.  Two perfectly-squared, southern windows are 
framed by plain, rectangular, linen curtains; the light that streams in 
during the day falls against a square-edged, plain, metal desk, behind which 
is a matching, brisk, low chair, whose wheels seem to have been ripped out.  
Even a few plants that grow in dusty, squared pots, placed above the filing 
cabinets, have a rigid tendency of standing straight, without the slightest 
bit of roundness.  Plain, squared lights levitate through the air, lighting 
when darkness sets in; though they occasionally try to reach the single, 
northern exit, some form of enchantment keeps them back.  
</desc>
    <editdraft>.  This is like a medical records room.  Patient files.  Metal filing cabinets.  House plants gathering dust.  Straight, no frills desk, though tidy'ish'.  Make it a bit quirky, this will give the receptionist the personality you think she should have.  We'll then make a mob with the personality you give her.  Maybe a tea set or kettle?

    <desc>This room has a peculiar shape, with a straight, southern wall interrupted 
by a solid, wooden door and a rounded, half-spherical remainder that gives 
this room the appearance of the interior of a belly.  The floor is covered 
in worn, ginger fur; upon it are scattered a series of cages, food for all 
types of creatures possible, some pictures of what look to be family pets, 
and, for some odd reason, two pairs of slippers.  The mess is enough to 
drive a reasonably-tidy person to hysterical despair; perhaps that is the 
reason why the lamps caught in alcoves underneath the ceiling shed a 
particularly soothing tinge of orange light.  Occasional, white, wooden 
boards are nailed to the walls, against the soft, white fur covering the 
walls and ceiling.  A scent of mixed food and dust mixes in the air with an 
off-putting effect.  The door to the southwest allows one reprieve from the 
malodorous chamber.

fashioned from calcite with iris-shaped diamonds atop each post.  A 
diaphanous canopy shrouds the bed with its prismatic shimmering.  The 
gossamer bedding is as light as air, yet its ethereal embrace magically 
bestows temperate harmony.  Hanging from the ceiling are interlaced ribbons 
of moonstone, ending at each side of the headboard.  These braids, as fine

crystal vases graced with white irises.  The door to the east fits so 
perfectly with the convex walls that if it weren't for the door knob of 
fleur-de-lis shape it wouldn't seem to exist.

their leaves branching across the ceiling.  Vignettes of lithe females dance 
about the trees.  Their sheer, willowy dresses billow about them; flowers 
and leaves decorate their hair as it ripples around their heads.  A 
luxurious, viridian duvet blankets the downy mattress nestled in the corner 
of the room.  During the day the room lights as the walls and ceiling mimic 
rays of sunlight.  Vibrant hues of blue, pink, orange, and purple effuse as 
the sun sets across the western door.  At night the backdrop turns inky, 
with only a bit of sketched moonlight and fairies granting light.

    <desc>Brown, dirt-encrusted walls curve in on themselves and then out again, 
reaching towards the floor of this passage.  The ground is made of 
unnaturally dry dirt and rocks, which turn into a labyrinth of stone and 
darkness to the east.  Sharp, irregular cones hang from a damp ceiling, 
sinisterly dangling on the brink of falling; their surface is perfectly 
smooth like that of icicles.  Drenched in cold water, the spikes are a 
darker brown than the walls, though they are clearly made from the same 
substance.  Barely four inches below the tip of the longest spike is a 
translucent, chokingly-dense, pink canopy which is seemingly made of smoke.  
Wide and broad, the glowing substance is nevertheless not voluminous enough 
to occupy the entire tunnel, which does not prevent it from occasionally 
slithering east, while audibly humming.  A grey, crumbling ladder is 
attached to the wall on the west end of the corridor, just below a trap 
door.

    <editdraftcomments>All seems great to me, sweetie.  :) I like the pink canopy, creative idea!  
I just want to ask, is there suppose to be 2 objects here?  Glitter, and a

    <desc>A steep slope comes to a staggering halt here, upon a plateau of creviced, 
dry rock.  Scentless, still, and ever-cold, the tunnel plunges down into a 
narrow, deep coil to the northwest.  Eternities pass here like fragments of 
a moment, marked by the steady, slow erosion of chasm strewn walls, which 
appear to be cut with the maniacal patience of a stone surgeon.  Contorted 
spikes dangle from the ceiling; towards the more distant west, where the 
tunnel end is visible, they are drenched in slippery moisture.  A puff of 
pink smoke passes underneath these coiled cones, forming of mist that chokes 
the breath out of any passer-by.  Beneath, the ground is made of heavy, 
irregular rock, peppered with an occasional speck of dust.

    <desc>A dark, dank, stone passage narrowly squeezes through here, broken in the 
middle like a snapped rib.  Its claustrophobically close walls are held 
together by a narrow strip of wrinkled, chasm-strewn ground; a slope sharply 
ascends towards the southeast.  Like the deadly instruments of a maniacal 
surgeon, shards of stone plunge down from the ceiling, forcing most 
travellers into a half-crouch.  The darkness clings to the walls like a 
possessive lover, filling every corner and sliding with mud-like 
sluggishness along the surface of the rocks.  To the southwest, the tunnel 
widens somewhat into a labyrinth of boulders and sharp slabs of stone.

    <desc>A slope thrusts up here out of a gaping, irregular, chasm-filled floor 
within the hungry darkness of a tunnel.  An oppressive silence hangs like a 
thick, dense slime against the stone, trickling up and down noiselessly 
against the shredded walls and the sharp, nearby ceiling.  Frozen in this 
state of lifelessness, boulders stand close to falling from all directions; 
menacing, makeshift blades of rock stick out like broken ribs from the 
sides.  The floor is riddled with troughs and peaks, allowing some limited 
passage up and down the slope, to the northeast and southeast.

shred the floor of this passage into so many chasms.  The troughs and 
forcibly thrusting peaks are certainly not hand-made, their edges abrupt,

break an ankle here; in fact, some unfortunate creature has already done so, 
its tiny bones resting at the bottom of a hole, forgotten and ever-still.

    <desc>A bent, narrow passageway struggles east and northwest, apparently as 
unwilling to go on as the earth around it is eager to collapse.  Cut and 
splintered edges of rock plunge and thrust out of the age-old stone; 
trenches of deep tears trace angry marks within the rough texture.  There is 
no light, no life, no motion here; only the stilled, crooked fury of rock 
and dirt endures.  A slope clambers up to the northwest, stumbling in great 
troughs and abrupt, nearly vertical mini-cliffs; to the east, the path is 
difficult and dark, coiling in a cruel, sharp bend, around which no light 
may plunge.

    <desc>The passage coils here like the innards of a stone serpent, carved within 
the rock by the anger of time.  Its corners are abrupt and sharpened like 
diamond edges, only with none of the beauty and luminosity of a precious 
stone.  Shadows crawl against the corners like a many-legged plague moving 
with almost mud-like density and hunger against anything solid that opposes 
it.  Claustrophobically narrow towards its northeastern end, the tunnel 
broadens somewhat as it turns west; the way is marked with sudden troughs 
and minor peaks that are brutally thrusting up from the stone.  The deep 
silence of ages drowns the rock, together with a cutting cold extending like 
a blanket everywhere.  There is no feeling here, no pain and no life, but 
merely the frozen expression of what might have once been emotion, but that 
is now forgotten beyond time and endless space.

    <desc>An abrupt turn cuts this passage like a shattered wrist, heading southwest.  
The walls are splintered, feeling frozen to the touch and dripping a 
nearly-solid, oozing substance from their many, deep wounds.  Lining the 
rock are traces of what might be a degenerate form of light-reflecting snow, 
but which, in fact, is a small vein of minerals; their shine is devoid of 
brilliance, with shadows eating away at their edges.  A scent of mould, 
thick with dust and ageless in its dank, dense misery, clings tight to the 
crouching passage, rising and falling with every unevenness of the 
treacherous floor.  Thin and wretched, sunken beneath the ancient stones and 
dripping, dead ooze, the tunnel struggles north, utterly devoid of anything 
that might resemble life.

    <desc>The deep darkness of this passage is dense, the cavern itself, still and as 
ageless as a forgotten tomb.  Everlastingly silent, the chamber might 
suggest untold and beautiful mysteries at first glance, in this world buried 
where few humans would ever find it.  The poetry of the unknown is ruptured, 
however, like a boil, between the cold bleakness of the chilling tunnel and 
the harsh barrenness and closeness of the nearing, crouching walls.  The 
rock is scarred by unhealing, cruel wounds that bleed a muddy, frozen 
substance that bears no resemblance to the blood of the living, but an ooze 
of decay that only the dead might leave behind.  Uneven, falling from sharp 
peaks into chaotically scattered, deep troughs, the floor is a danger to any 
but the most experienced, firm ankles; the claustrophobic way reaches south 
and northwest.

    <desc>Close to each other like the thick, abrasive palms of a rheumatic stone 
monster, the walls of this tunnel lean against each other, contorted and 
huddled in a sickening crunch.  The silence is sequestering, repressing like 
a claustrophobic tomb, buried far beneath any semblance of life.  Utterly 
still in its ageless, untouched existence, the cavern is encrusted in the 
thick shadows that cling to its every inch.  A pallor devoid of brilliance 
traces a few mineral-like substances that decorate the walls in straight, 
stark, patternless lines.  Cold, barren, and abandoned, the passage is 
deceitful in its crookedness, elongating and shortening distances, and 
throwing strange, grotesque shadows west and southeast, where the 
unappealing, scarred stone crumbles onward.

      <desc>The walls are close and thick, leaving only narrow passage between them.  
Crouched and rounded into a small, crumpled ceiling and an equally 
unappealing, uneven floor, they are scarred by cruel, deep wounds, some 
dripping a thick, mudded moisture.  Protuberances and sharp, claw-like 
elongations menacingly hang from the ceiling, draped in shadows, cold, and 
silence, looking like frozen weapons with no victim to strike.  Surreal, and 
gleaming palely in the forgotten tomb are a few lines of minerals, in 
striking contrast with the black barrenness of the otherwise plain rock.  
Their shine, however, is utterly dead and chilled by ages gone by; their 
brilliance is faded away to a sickening, dense grey.  A scent of sharp, 
mixed undertones heavy under the burden of thick dust and mould, exudes from 
the walls like poison, crawling with the insistence of a serpent.

    <desc>No trace of humanity tames the strange, ethereal quality of this suffocated 
passage.  Like the windpipe of a stone giant, the narrow cavern is ringed 
with deep troughs that throb in a dance of shadows.  Utterly still, the 
tunnel is claustrophobically small, causing a medium-sized adult to crouch 
in order to move either westward or eastward.  Neither direction is 
encouraging, either one as miserable, dank, and cold as this cave-like 
length of the stone tomb.  The floor beneath the feet is wrinkled and 
occasionally sharp, melting into the side walls with the smoothness of a 
slimy amoeba.  The air is drenched in the cold, dust-filled scent of ageless 
rock.

    <desc>Forgotten under the crushing weight of a terrible, dense silence, a narrow 
path slips east and southwest.  The way is suffocating, close and low, 
forcing any creature taller than a house-elf to crouch if they wish to leave 
this nightmarish prison.  Surrounded by stone, drenched in utter, 
indomitable darkness, buried in the deepest, nameless insides of the earth, 
the passage offers little hope.  All around, shadows quiver and extend like 
thick slime, licking at the walls, ceiling, and floor.  A dreadful cold 
lingers close to the rocks; beneath it, trapped in a cage-like, vicious 
prison, the air is pungent with decay.  Dry and wrinkled, cold and narrow, 
the tunnel is still in timeless contemplation, the very essence of 
emotionless, everlasting life within death.

    <desc>A frozen silence forbiddingly closes around the smallness of this passage, 
possessively suffocating it in its emotionless power.  Barely two feet 
apart, the cavern offers barely enough space for a medium-sized human to 
crouch through; claustrophobic in its irregular texture and utter, blinding 
darkness, the hole is damp and reeking of mould, dust, and decay.  Strange 
markings and etchings mar the wrinkled face of all-surrounding rock, as 
though an unfortunate soul had gone mad with fright here, pushing against 
the earth that swallowed him and leaving the imprint of shoulders, hands, 
and knees.  Careless in its timeless immutability, the endless walls of rock 
are still and cold to the touch, leaving no doubt that they would stand for 
millennia as they do now, unchanged in their crookedness.  The strangled 
tunnel bends to the northeast, but widens slightly to the south.

      <desc>The walls are irregular and wrinkled like a decaying face, beyond the 
threshold of reasonable old age.  Dry troughs sometimes as deep as half a 
foot trace the places where this impassive stone has bled dust through the 
ages, though no movement now stirs the deep cavern.  Broken at irregular 
intervals in flatter, strange, smooth shapes, these wound-like ditches trail 
away all across the sides of the tunnel, thickly plunging into the 
irregular, narrow floor.  The markings on the walls look like the traces of 
a human being, with imprints of shoulders, knees, and fists deeply crushed 
against the impassive tunnel surface.  Deep inside the rock, embedded out of 
reach, is the faint remainder of a long, claw-like fingernail.  No traces of 
whatever drove this creature to such despair remain; likewise, the remains 
of the victim are lost amidst the dust and stone, having been there for 
centuries or more.

slashes that vary in depth from a fraction of an inch to half a foot or 
more, the stone crowds obsessively near, ceiling to floor and wall to wall.  
Claws as delicate as icicles and as deadly as Venetian stilettos hang from 
the side walls, crawling with any faint, white reflections of light made 
lifeless by wounds of grey minerals.  A forbidding silence hangs low against 
the very dense air of the passage, emotionless and cold beyond words, a 
frozen guardian that watches and waits, everlasting and everstill.  Curling 
northward between a gap so narrow it barely allows for the crouched entry of 
a human-sized creature, the passage plunges further into darkness.  Bending 
like a tortured arm splintered from the bone, the tunnel stumbles further 
southwest.

    <desc>Dark, reeking of the mouldy scent of hundreds of years of gathered dust and 
minerals, a narrow passage digs through the deep bowels of the earth.  
Irregular walls crawl close together, wrinkling the ceiling and the floor 
into sharp peeks and troughs; their surfaces are so slashed and deeply 
etched with chaotic, meaningless lines and curves that not even the most 
persistent of torches can penetrate all the minuscule hideouts they hold.  
Bleeding wounds of minerals scar the upper side of the tunnel, echoing any 
light in a faint, dim, dull shine, utterly lifeless in its everlasting 
stillness.  Nothing moves within this cavern; immutable, cold beyond belief, 
it is ageless, a timeless tomb in which the very bones of the creature 
within have rotted to nothing more than fine dust in floor cracks.  The 
dense silence hangs low against the walls, heavy like a curse.  Hollow and 
painfully quiet, the passage crawls on west and northeast.

    <desc>Barely wide enough for two medium-sized people to walk beside one another, 
this tunnel is utterly still in its self-sufficient, everlasting existence.  
A heavy darkness lingers within the permanent silence, trapped inside this 
cavernous tomb under the dead weight of dust-filled air; even under the 
glare of a most persistent torch, the tunnel appears to stubbornly withhold 
secrets beyond the reach of light.  Sloping downwards at a struggling, 
painfully-slow pace, the floor is covered in slashes etched like wounds into 
the hardy stone; immutable and so very cold, the all-surrounding rock is 
dull-grey, interrupted only towards its upper sides by smooth, gleaming 
traces of minerals.  Close to the ground, the ceiling looms like an imminent 
angel of doom, stilled forever in the timelessness of this passage.  The 
cavern digs deeper into the insides of the earth to the east and northwest.

      <desc>Infinitely patient throughout the ages of their existence, the walls of this 
passage loom in a stiff crouch, held together by a jagged ceiling.  There is 
no indication of how long this strange, eerie, timeless passage has stood 
here, but if every wrinkle and broken trench etched into its sides 
represents an hour of its existence, the cave is already beyond the years of 
any witch or wizard in history.  Sharp points and deep troughs mar the 
entire surface of rock, only smoothed in the gashes of silvery minerals that 
bleed in chaotic slashes against the upper part of the tunnel.  Any light 
reflected off these strange substances, however, is hollow and lifeless, 
like all else that is trapped here, in the deep bowels of the earth.

    <desc>A suffocating passage, too narrow for a broad-shouldered, full-grown man to 
cross any way but sideways, opens here with the reluctance of a 
long-strained muscle.  The texture of the walls is in some areas abrasive to 
the point of sharpness; in other areas, the dents and troughs that are 
etched like frozen wrinkles in a decrepit, old face give way to smooth 
wounds of silver gleams.  Minerals of many kinds line the upper part of the 
age-old tunnel in chaotic turns and swirls that reflect any light in a shine 
devoid of life, full of the stillness and immortality of immutable death.  
The floor beneath is sloping down towards the southeast at a painful pace, 
stumbling like an old thing close to its end; a turn as painstakingly slow 
as the path following it bends the walls in the middle of the part of the 
passage.  Narrowed with a vengeance, the strangled tunnel rises as it goes 
on westward.

    <desc>A faint glimmer of minerals traces scars against the closely-leaning walls 
of this tunnel.  As the passage ascends from the north, the pallid shine of 
these rocks lengthens from mere tingles a few inches apart to whole wounds, 
etched deeply against the surrounding mass of stone.  Caressing them with 
the fervour of a demented, maniacal tormenter, the thick air lingers close 
to the solid surfaces around, stagnating, thick, and dust-filled.  The walls 
are tightly held together, the ceiling and the floor so wrinkled and broken 
they appear to have been mercilessly squeezed together, drawing ever closer 
throughout the ages of the world.  With no escape and no glimpse of the 
outside, the cavern lingers in eternal timelessness, its existence measured 
in the hardiness of rock.  To the east, the tunnel breaks into a rolling 
slope downward.

      <desc>On closer inspection, these minerals are of many types, subtly varying in 
their tone of grey; a sheen of eerie, tingling, miniature studs marks the 
existence of these rather special formations that stretch like curse slashes 
in the surface of the stone walls.  The light they reflect is unworldly 
beautiful, like the complicated magnificence of a star not revealed to man 
except in its most mundane, far quality; magnificent though it might be, the 
gleam is utterly dead and pallid beyond belief, like the glitter of chaotic, 
destructive madness within a human eye.

    <desc>A serpentine cuts through the depths of the earth, etched into stone like 
something made by an artist with a maniacal liking for sharp cutting.  
Twisting like a being in pain, the tunnel is narrow, a slope labouring to 
ascend south between irregular, hardy walls, ready to bruise flesh and bone. 
 The ceiling is much too close to the floor for comfort; any creature taller 
than an average fourteen year old would have to crouch considerably.  The 
dense, dust-filled air in the cavern clings to the walls almost like a 
liquid shroud; the entire passage exudes an eerie sense of timelessness.  
Scarred and worn thin to an utterly dead tomb with neither magnificence, nor 
beauty to support it, the cave endures throughout the ages like an old 
wraith, forever still, forever there.  Westward, the passage struggles on.

    <desc>Suffocating and tight to the point where a man broad of shoulder would need 
to cross it walking sideways, this tunnel struggles east and north, broken 
in the middle like a half-formed curse.  The curvature is anything but 
smooth; the walls are truncated like mismatched slabs of stone that have 
collapsed in this awkward posture, cutting into one another.  The floor 
beneath is old and irregularly chopped into chaotic rises and troughs; its 
nearness to the ceiling is threatening and claustrophobic.  Along every bit 
of wall, the air is draped like a thick, dense coverlet, imbued with the 
timeless stillness of ages that have passed as moments.  Unchanged, not 
withering, forever cold, the passage gives, more than anything, a feeling of 
trapped torment, reeking with the sense of death.

    <desc>Oppressive like a quiet, everstill tomb, this cavern breaks here like a 
shattered arm of a long-dead, stone giant.  With a nightmarish precision, 
shards of rock plunge from the side walls into the path of the unwary 
traveller, sharpened at the ends like Venetian stilettos.  An eerie sense of 
timelessness hangs heavily against the solid surroundings of this irregular, 
uneven cave, wrapped in oppressive, thick air; forgotten here, in the bowels 
of the world, an age may pass by unnoticed, without a single trace of aging 
or of life.  A slope abruptly rises to the northwest, along a floor cut in 
sadistic, chaotic, everlasting tattoos.  Thinning like a corset made to 
strangle any remainder of life from a human chest, the shape of the tunnel 
narrows to the south into the shadow of a passage.

hairpin-like weapons of a wounded warrior poised in a kamikaze deathblow, 
shards extend with deathly delicacy through the space separating the walls.  
Their points, fragile like glass, are ready to break in a wound like deadly 
Venetian stilettos.

    <desc>Static, motionless like a vision suspended between thought and the 
subconscious, this cave plunges from northwest to southeast down a rocky, 
abrupt slope; the ground is uneven in crisscrossing peaks and inch-deep 
troughs.  The tunnel is roughly cylindrical, with the ceiling hanging 
menacingly low and the walls so close to each other they appear determined 
to crush any passer-by within their grasp.  Like bleeding wounds against the 
surrounding stone are formations of polished minerals that echo any light in 
shivering, fantastic myriads of pale designs.  Withered in timeless 
forgetfulness, this cave is drowned underneath thick, moist air that clings 
to any solid surface like a shroud.  Cold and utterly still, the immutable 
surfaces shiver in and out of a dream-like quality, ageless and unchanging 
throughout the centuries of the outside world.

    <desc>A tunnel stretches here through the deep bowels of the earth, plunging down 
a steep, abrupt slope towards the southeast.  Rounded, cylindrical, rough 
walls stand claustrophobically close to each other, abrasive to the touch 
and covered in zigzagging, wound-like marks.  Spread in patternless whirls, 
polished, smooth minerals echo any light in intersecting myriads of chaotic, 
dazzling, dead white.  The air is heavy and hollow of all life, filled only 
with a grim, immutable glory of timelessness.  No sunlight penetrates the 
layers upon layers of earth above; without it, the cavern knows no 
difference between night and day, between this year and the next, its life 
measured in the slow, age-long crumbling of rock and stone.  A thick 
moisture permeates the air along the northwestern continuation of the 
tunnel.

of abrasive, rough rock, littered with polished, surreally beautiful 
fragments of minerals.  Any light breaks against their smooth surfaces, 
being echoed back in tired gleams, drained of all life and passion.  The 
floor is hard and solid; its surface is just as twisted and harsh as the 
rest of the cavern, apparently untouched for ages by any foot, human or 
otherwise.  Beneath the scant light, the cavern is clear and completely 
still, the moist air deathly heavy and clinging to the walls and earth like

    <desc>Like the blind, glazed whites of millions of open eyes, the walls of this 
tunnel give brilliant sparkles as any source of light breaks into countless 
pinnacles of flickering shimmers.  Like ethereal and eternal torches, these 
exotic sources of illumination are plunging in and out of a sense of 
timelessness; they and the all-surrounding rock are immutable and enduring, 
one crumbling moment of their existence as long as an age of the outside 
world.  The air is dense and moist, frozenly clinging to the minerals that 
stand, untainted, all across the upper parts of this tomb.  Beneath, the 
ground gives way into what looks to be a deep, dark well, with no end in 
sight; the passage from soil to water is smooth and dizzyingly slippery.  
There is no movement in the glass-like surface of this inner, minute lake, 
as though it, too, is as endless and as dead as the surrounding cold.  To 
the southeast, the tunnel plunges on, its walls echoing the faint light of 
the living in cold, emotionless shades of bright, but dead white.

layers upon layers of heavy, cold, glass-dense water, a passage falls to the 
north.  Its already minute size is diminished by maws filled with 
gruesomely-contorted, jagged, tooth-like tumours that part the surface of 
this completely still, matte water.  The nearby walls are irregular, 
although their texture is slick along the floor, slippery underneath the 
still, tomb-like lake.  Curving against the cylindrical surface like the 
delicate blades of scimitar-shaped scalpels are the last traces of pride of 
the old rocky surface, in the shape of foot-long, smooth-edged stilettos.  
Some seven feet up, the crushing density of the water breaks into the

strangely-angled, rough edges, are blade-like, rock-carved stilettos that

narrow, gigantic windpipe made of rock, the stone tunnel descends perfectly 
vertically downwards for what feels like a hundred feet; at an abrupt end is 
a seal-like slab of rock representing the bottom.  Isolated from the rest of 
the world, this dry tube is constricting, cracked from old age, and filled 
with a heavy, thick silence of death.  Bones are scattered all over the 
bottom, probably belonging to multiple individuals, since there are at least 
two or three skulls lying scattered amongst ribs, arm bones, hips, and 
pelvises.  Fissures scar the ancient rock of the nearby walls; broken 
fragments of crumbling rock add to the lonely, oppressing mess on the 
ground.  An occasional, faint fragment of light beams overhead, where the 
tunnel opens to the surface; a game of shadows and threatening drafts of icy 
wind permanently dance like mad dervishes across the walls.

to descend into the depths of the well or not is hard to tell, though the 
cold draft that occasionally winds through the rock cracks might be an 
indication to stay put.

    <desc>Turning like the abrupt curves of a crudely-carved sculpture, a passage 
twists west and south like a gigantic, broken hand, snapped in the middle.  
Shards of rock stick out at strange angles, jagged and contorted, screaming 
of some untold pain.  Drowning the cavern in their cold, dense weight are 
multiple layers of glass-thick water, gleaming with a matte, utterly dead 
sheen.  A deep darkness crawls all around the corners of the harsh passage; 
shadows play like mad in the ever-still mirror of the deep lake, dancing 
like an army of quiet wraiths, waiting for their next victim.  Hungry, 
claw-like hands extend from the ceiling and walls of this narrow, 
cylindrical hole, ready to grip and tear at anything they might reach; 
pincer-like, delicate ends hang deceivingly-loose at their ends, like 
Venetian stilettos ready to break in a wound.

    <desc>Completely submerged under the cold weight of motionless water, a tunnel 
struggles through, heading east.  The walls are jagged and all too near.  
Though the permanent insistence of the unmoving water has cut a path through 
many layers of strong rock, the stone still stubbornly holds its own.  Claws 
of earth with slick edges, but no blunt tips reach out, claustrophobically 
close to one another, making the swim through this passage dangerously close 
to a walk through a knife-strewn maze.  A small opening, no wider than four 
feet across, reaches out into the ceiling.  An uncertain, timid glimmer of 
light blooms from above, spreading like a lily through the dense, cold, 
glass-like surface of the water.  Unfortunately, it does not go very far, 
drowning in the black maw of the pitch-black, jagged darkness.

    <desc>The oppressive weight of frigid water above and all around lends an 
unnatural stillness to this area.  Cupped like the vast palm of a pale, 
corpse-cold hand, the limestone bed of the subterranean lake, dotted with 
luminous coral, extends in all directions.  Overhead, the thin, pale 
bioluminescence reflects of the water's surface.  A dark, irregular hole 
leads down into the rock below.  Clinging to the rough edges of the rocky 
passage is a dull, slippery coating of red-brown algae, staining the rock to 
the precise shade of dried blood.

    <desc>A fluted bulge of limestone wall stands to the north and northeast of this 
water-filled area.  The preternaturally still water is oppressively cold, 
sapping heat and motion from anything in its icy embrace.  To the northwest 
lies a shadowy alcove heaped with dingy, beige debris.  Smooth, algae-slick 
floor, scattered patches of freshwater coral emitting an aureate glow, and 
clear, sweet water spread to the west, southwest, south, southeast and east. 
 Overhead, the mirror-still surface of the lake reflects the pale, jaundiced 
landscape.

    <desc>Submerged in a calm, subterranean lake, this area is flooded with sweet 
water that tastes of limestone and an unidentifiable combination of 
dissolved minerals.  Overhead, the surface reflects the faint light produced 
by the glowing encrustations of coral that dot the lakebed, giving only 
hints of the darkness above.  To the south, a narrow passage, obstructed by 
a half-sunken, battered rock formation, leads to a chamber walled in the 
same, slippery, buff limestone that reaches off to the east and west in 
unmoving billows.  To the northeast, north and northwest, the 
gently-cambered surface of the lakebed extends into the ghostly dimness.

    <desc>The current-free water of this underground lake extends in almost all 
directions from this spot.  Overhead, the surface sits like a 
partially-silvered mirror, allowing an occasional glimpse of the unlit 
cavern above, and an even rarer look at the bizarre formations looming in 
the deep shadows high above.  Below, intermittent growths of luminescent, 
freshwater coral fill the water with dim light the colour of lemon juice and 
stud the flooded cavern floor with miniature imitations of the stone 
nightmares on the cave roof.  The southwest is blocked by a curving billow 
of furrowed limestone wall, every edge polished to a finish as smooth as 
blown glass.

    <desc>Filled with frigid water as still as death, this area is dimly lit with the 
sickly glow of the bioluminescent coral scattered over the limestone 
lakebed.  Overhead, the immutable surface provides a reflection of the 
aqueous chamber while remaining, itself, unchanged and serene.  Off to the 
north, a brighter patch is visible against the sculpted ivory floor.  The 
lake bottom undulates out to the northwest, west, southwest, and south.  The 
cambered, slick cavern wall extends to the north and southeast.

    <desc>The embracing curve of limestone cavern enfolds closely here, cradling icy 
water within walls extending west and south.  Off in the southwestern 
distance, dimly luminescent freshwater coral dot the slimy, pallid lakebed.  
Closer to hand, a riot of the same creatures encrust the interior of a 
four-foot, circular hole in the floor.  Rather than the sickly, jaundiced 
light that washes the rest of the lake, the illumination rising from below 
is richer, brighter and golden in tone.  The concentrated light is mirrored 
off the lake's surface above, like a ghost of the harvest moon.

    <desc>The bitterly-cold water that fills this space is as oppressively unmoving as 
ice.  With a little imagination, the chilly surface of the lake-carved 
limestone wall that stretches east and west resembles the slick, ivory 
frigidity of a frozen surface.  Off to the east, a small gap is visible 
between to bulging curves of limestone, leading to what appears to be a 
chamber beyond.  To the east, an irregularity in the wall suggests another 
such chamber some distance away.  The lakebed stretches to the north and 
northwest, dimly-lit by isolated clumps of bioluminescent freshwater coral, 
their glow suffusing the water with a weak, yellow light.

    <desc>The strength-sapping chill of the all-encompassing water is as oppressive as 
the motionless weight of the lake overhead, topped by lifeless air and 
countless tons of heavy rock.  Bioluminescent encrustations cast a pale, 
jaundiced glow over the sculpted lakebed, but the thin light adds no warmth 
to the perpetual cold of the subterranean waterscape.  The undulating wall, 
stretching north and southeast, bears horizontal, algae-slick grooves and 
linear mounds like the grain of exposed muscle.  Here and there, a more 
prominent bulge mimics a sinew, buttressing the almost-organic limestone.  
The eerie radiance of freshwater coral to the north, northeast, east, and 
southeast indicates that a swimmer could head unimpeded in those directions. 
 Above waits the mirror-still surface and the heavy darkness of the cave.

    <desc>Eerily-tranquil water, clear as crystal, fills this space rising high 
overhead to the glassy stillness of the dark surface above.  Livid, ivory 
limestone forms the lakebed that bounds the area from below; scattered 
clumps of luminescent coral make the pallid rock nearby seem to glow with a 
tentative, jaundiced light.  The lake extends in all horizontal directions, 
except for the northeast, where a curved and striated wall, like an 
enormous, lifeless ribcage, blocks travel.  Off to the north and northwest, 
the floor of a shadowy alcove is littered with pale debris.

    <desc>The perfectly still waters of this lake are permanently cold; while at first 
the sensation might be refreshing, it grows dull and painful on joints and 
limbs.  Unmoving, like a watery tomb with a great, majestic roof, the lake 
offers no shores; only its depths, as uncannily still and silent as the 
surface, offer passage.  The ceiling is partly rounded, showing some signs 
that the water might once have reached a higher level, but for the most 
part, it rises, fragmented and irregularly-shaped, beyond reach.  Overlarge, 
overbumpy, grape-like rocks hang above, in a sculptural masterpiece that no 
man has touched.  In all directions, the lake stretches out densely and 
hungrily.

    <desc>Devoid of the tender music of restless waves, filled only with the emptiness 
of stillness and silence, a lake opens here in all directions except north 
and northeast, where the water meets a rocky wall.  High, echoing the quiet 
of millennia and too seldom an inkling of life, the austere ceiling is 
smooth where it meets the nearby, strong pillar, but rises gracefully in 
irregular patterns towards the south.  Smooth and straight for the most 
part, the wall has only a rounded, two-inch deep grove tracing it around the 
constant water level.  The immobility of the entire room and its utter 
lifelessness are perhaps reassuring for a while, but the forced serenity of 
it, timeless in its frozen silence, is enough to grow suffocating.  Beneath 
the evercold waters, the wall refracts strangely, its steep angles grotesque 
and desolately empty.  The depths of the lake are accessible, despite this 
deceiving image.

    <desc>Strong walls of pallid limestone shy away from the cold, steel-blue water 
that has smoothed them to straight dampness.  Quiet and still, the lake is a 
timeless, frozen, water-filled tomb, forbidding in its strange magnificence. 
 Against the high ceiling, dancers of unworldly beauty are petrified in 
their swirls and tumbling, as though in one instant, the life had been 
drained from them with a single, cruel splash of this otherwise-passive 
water.  A silence beyond imagination fills the entire cavern so densely that 
the air is a suffocating burden to breathe.  Reflections of the frozen water 
show that the way is open in all directions but southeast and southwest, 
where the walls stand; despite the mutilated refractions of these rocky 
pillars, the depths of the lake are accessible for any brave enough to 
challenge them.

      <desc>The ceiling is low and rounded where it meets the vertical walls to the 
southeast and southwest; as unlikely as the completely-still lake makes it 
seem, the water level must once have been higher than it is now, scraping 
the cave as far as the point where the roof kisses its sides.  Strange, 
twisting shapes of dancers frozen in their whirls and turns adorn the 
ceiling, as though upon an inverted platform.  The beats of their shoes have 
long been silent; the rustles of their breathtaking gowns have long slipped 
into wrinkled, tattered flags of undying youth.  All life is drained from 
them, all hope, quieted; so are the drama and despair of their anguished 
dances.

    <desc>Quieted into an uncanny, disturbing stillness, the waters of this steel-blue 
lake extend, like a sheen of clear, liquid ice, in all directions but east 
and northeast.  Royally majestic, painfully perfect to the last, delicate 
wrinkle, the ceiling rises high above the surface; its smooth, low, rounded 
eastern side gives in westward to high, angled, chaotic shapes that stand 
sharply in relief, as though cut by the sure, scalpel-armed hand of a 
surgeon.  The side walls, possessively traced by deathly-immutable layers of 
water, are vertical and level, except for a gorge that seems only a 
prediction of how much more ground the patient rock will yield to its 
shrewd, cruel lover.  The all-surrounding, hollow silence is heavy with the 
repressed emotion of decades or perhaps centuries; a sense of fierce 
timelessness only comparable to the immensity of death itself hangs low 
against this impossibly-beautiful vista.  Below, the depths await, as still 
and beautiful as the surface.

      <desc>At first sight, the eastern part of the ceiling appears a somewhat twisted 
part of the walls, rounded and smoothed decades before, when the water level 
must have been higher.  As it ascends, to the west, the roof breaks into the 
strange, eerily beautiful, chaotic patterns of a carved ballet; the 
rock-made, bowing and whirling dancers are strange, but very lovely in their 
appearances, every one of their features carved to perfection.  Forbidding 
and delicate like the rest of this quiet, still, watery tomb, these majestic 
carvings, too, are frozen in a premature death, which might preserve their 
glory, but which takes the flaring fire of passion from them, turning it 
into the frost of timeless indifference.

scaling it would be nearly impossible.  The motionless, bone-chilling water

that resemble oversized, heavily-buttered popcorn.  As the ceiling of the 
cave rises out of view, larger, pendulous encrustations are the only sign, 
besides the thick darkness, that the chamber is enclosed.  The walls stretch

reflecting any glint of light that impacts it.

    <desc>Smoothed out by the persistent, everlasting action of this lake, the 
northeastern wall is perfectly rounded, refracting oddly in the dense, 
frozen waters.  A permanent cold suffuses in the atmosphere, soaking it into 
a dripping numbness, rendering the kindness of a smooth wall irrelevant to a 
freezing set of joints and limbs.  The stillness of the water is tomb-like, 
its surface, constant and everlasting; while at first this might seem 
reassuring, it can grow into an overwhelming, exasperating, suffocating 
burden.  Rounded where it falls into the gentleness of the walls, the 
ceiling rises sharply afterwards, soon out of reach.  Hanging down from it 
are odd, popcorn-like formations, like uncanny fruit of the rocky roof.  
There is no possibility of assailing the walls or climbing out of the reach 
of the hauntingly-quiet lake; the only ways to go are across its surface, in 
all directions but northeast, or down into its gloomy depths.

    <desc>Immutable and cold beyond imagination, a lake spreads north, west, east, and 
northwest, its waters immaculately still and uncannily quiet.  The 
overwhelming, surrounding silence is heavy like a burden, 
suffocatingly-dense with the unheard rustles, cries, and laughter of 
decades.  To the south, southeast, and northeast, rounded by the insistent, 
cruel tenderness of the unmoving waters, are limestone walls; their surface 
is smoothed to a slick, wet, perfectly vertical shape, with only a two-inch 
grove around the level of the lake.  Above, the ceiling hangs not too far 
away; while at first this might be reassuring, it can grow too near for 
comfort.  Curiously-carved, fantastic shapes hang down from the roof, 
occasionally reflected in the cold surface; their sharp angles are cut to 
clear perfection, as though by the thin, merciless blade of a scalpel.  
Beneath, the depths await.

fiercely beautiful turns and twists to the north and west.  Hanging down on 
what seem to be their own, lovely costumes, beautiful, strange dancer-like 
carvings are frozen in their last whirl, turn, or graceful bow.  Like all 
else in this cave, they are still and passionless, enduring in this unmoving 
form, but without the spark of life in them.  Everything about them is 
immaculately etched in stone, every curve and turn of their infinitely 
elastic bodies is perfectly clear; despite this all, they are no more than 
the adornment of a cold, underground cave whose life has seeped away into 
immortal silence.

    <desc>Unbelievably cold, crawling with the mounting, repressed rage of ages, a 
lake spreads west, south, and southwest, its waters stilled in a forced, 
tormented sheen of fluid ice.  The quiet is unbearable, quickly becoming an 
unspeakable, heavy burden; the air is drowned within the dense silence.  
Slick, wet, and empty, a rocky surface encloses, suffocating and protective, 
all around the lake, with only a two inch deep gorge around the water level. 
 Above, the ceiling rises in abrupt turns and twists, as delicate and 
precise as the movements of a young gymnast, whose limbs are frozen in a 
whirling flurry of hurried steps, screaming in silent pain.  The hall is 
quiet like a tomb, with nothing to disturb its age-old magnificence; 
beneath, the depths are open to those brave enough to sink beneath the 
impassive, cruel water.
