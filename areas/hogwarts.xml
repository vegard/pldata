    <extra>nodegrade</extra>
    <extradesc>
      <desc>The golden frame of the portrait is rusty and grimy, but the picture inside 
is of good quality.  A woman in a large black and yellow dress is sitting 
inside the canvas; she occasionally waves or wanders away to a neighbouring 
picture for a while.  The picture is large and takes up most of the space 
from ceiling to floor.  The paint is slightly chipped and cracked over the 
lightly spun canvas, but the portrait is still in a reasonable and 
presentable condition.

      <desc>Merlin is portrayed in grey-white stone which looks aged and weathered. 
Swirls of white rock adorn the sides and creep up round the carved figure. A

Moss sneaks between eroded cracks, but the statue is tall and still looks 
magnificent.

      <desc>Wendelin the Weird is portrayed as a distinctly deranged woman.  The stone 
surrounding the bust has been sculpted into the shape of flames, which 
symbolise her love of burning.  A metal plaque, affixed to the base, reads 
'Wendelin the Weird; 1754 - 1809'.  The stone is grey and aged, although 
some white patches remain, giving it a rather untidy look.  It is, however, 
a positive asset to the corridor.

still make out some of the small tool marks across the smooth, aged surface. 
 The couple are locked in a gentle embrace, looking kindly into one 
another's eyes.  The detail and subtlety of expression in the carving is 
sublime, perfectly conveying the love between the two.  Several places on 
the statue a heavily worn, the detail now obscured, from hopeful fingers of 
students touching the hands and hems.

A frame designed of solid gold wraps around the work of art.  The frame appears shaped from golden twigs interlaced with one another.  Inlays of leaves and flowers grace the frame.  Dark green leaves fall from the painting, as if the tree was weeping.

    <name>The Entrance Hall</name>
    <copyright>Copyright © 2004-2010  Project Legilimensia</copyright>
    <desc>The school's massive entrance hall resides beyond the monumental, stone 
archway that surrounds the imposing, weather-beaten, oak doors.  Resplendent 
with statues, figures, and sculptures, polished suits of armour stand guard 
around this cavernous room.  Inlaid patterns, elegant masonry, and huge 
pieces of artwork, illuminated by burning torches, are displayed upon the 
stone walls.  Upon the vaulted ceiling, a large chandelier, bedecked with 
countless candles, lavishes the hall with a healthy glow.  The flagstone 
floor leads to a magnificent, gleaming, white marble stairway, above which 
is a large crest inscribed with the legend: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft 
and Wizardry.  The wide steps lead up to the topmost floor and down into the 
dungeons.  A door to the east opens up to a smaller staircase, while an 
imposing exit to the south leads to the Great Hall.  To the north, a 
corridor leads deeper into the castle and to the west, the stone archway 
leads outside.

    <desc>Four, massive, wooden tables dominate the floor space of the Great Hall.  
Each is adorned with a table cloth coloured for each of the different 
houses: Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.  At the top of the 
hall, residing upon a raised platform, sits the High Table where the staff 
break their bread.  Along the four walls, rows of triangular banners display 
the house colours.  The vast, curved ceiling is enchanted to mimic the 
conditions of the current sky.  Stained glass windows filter light into the 
room, while hundreds of floating, burning candles add to the warmth 
emanating in this place.  The Antechamber is to the east and to the north 
is the entrance hall.

Breathing is heavy and laborious.  The room is lighted poorly by the few 
scattered torches in wall brackets. A fireplace sits on the wall ahead, but 
it looks ashen and dead.  There is a chill making the place seem even 
more unwelcoming.  A door to the west leads out into the Great Hall.

    <desc>Though this lengthy hall has shining suits of armour standing at attention 
along its walls, it is otherwise warm &amp; toasty.  Bright lighting and soft 
colours lend a feeling of welcome and contentment.  The walls are decked 
with several paintings.  The first painting features a pudgy witch in puce 
robes devouring a ham hock.  The second is of an austere, persnickety 
warlock in robes of the deepest blue dining on a four-course meal.  The 
final painting depicts an effeminate, fastidious wizard who has donned 
fuchsia robes and is noshing on a piece of luscious fruit.  Eastward leads 
to the Hufflepuff common room.  The stairs going upward lead to the ground 
floor.

    <desc>Illuminated only by guttering torches, this dark passage is consumed by a 
foreboding gloom.  A cold flagstone floor, encrusted with drying mold, lies 
underfoot.  Thin veins of trickling water meander down the etched stone 
walls.  All the while, an incessant dripping punctuates the groans of rusted 
chains, suspended and swaying from the chiselled ceiling.  There are broad 
steps leading up to the light and warmth of the main hall and away to the 
east into the ever darkening dungeons.

    <desc>The torches burning in the iron brackets along this long corridor make it 
quite rosy.  Suits of armour attend these flames and a few comfortable 
benches welcome all.  Several still lifes adorn the passageway.  These bowls 
of fruit are bright, pleasing, and definitely appealing.  They are almost 
life-like ...  Quite delicious.  The Hufflepuff's common room is to the 
east.  To the north is the girls' bathroom.

    <desc>The dim and dark corridor is comprised of grimy stone.  A few torches attempt to flicker a little light, but are barely succeeding.  Cob webs are scattered throughout the passage.  Still lifes hang upon the walls attempting to offer a little character to the otherwise drab and dreary hall.  To the north, a door leads to the Boy's Bathroom.  The door to the south leads to the Hufflepuff Common Room.  The corridor continues to the east and west.

    <desc>The kitchen is vast with vaulted ceilings and spotless, sparkling, silver 
utensils and copper pots hanging from the stone walls.  Four long, wooden 
tables, mimicking the ones in the Great Hall's above, dominate the room.  
Along one wall a similar, wooden table sits beneath the High Table and an 
immense, brick fireplace is located upon the other end.  Several massive 
ovens, powered by fire, are set along another wall.  The rest of the wall 
space houses stone counters and sinks.  Spigots furnish fresh water and 
cause damp air to blanket the room.  Upon the flagstone floor sit enormous 
bronze, copper, and pewter cauldrons of all sizes.  Mismatched pieces of 
crockery, pans, and cutlery are scattered throughout the room or piecemealed 
across the tables.  The pantries are full of delicious sundries.  Enormous 
freezers possess slabs of meat and other savory items.  Cupboards display 
the fine sets china, gold plates and utensils, and silver tea services 
polished to a high sheen.  The exit is through the door to the north.

    <desc>Home of the most loyal, industrious students, the Hufflepuff Common Room is 
as warm and bright as a sunshiny day.  Yellow tapers float close to the 
ceiling spreading a cozy glow across the room.  The Caen stone walls are 
adorned with tapestries of badgers woven in amber, yellow ochre, and gold on 
ebony backdrops.  Plush, buttercup and charcoal-coloured chairs and oak 
tables are arranged atop the blonde, hardwood floors.  By the black marble 
fireplace, a couple of squashy, honeyed sofas relax upon a thick, sumptuous 
rug.  A notice board resides along one wall and large, bay windows allow a 
glimpse of the outdoors.  The dormitories are to the south and the door to 
leave the common room is to the north.

as a result, furniture and decoration are lacking.  A single rusted suit of

    <desc>The hallway is narrow and the walls seem to press in, squashing up the 
floor.  The floor itself looks oddly raised, as if it were built on an 
incline.  The air carries the burden of a cold draft, which sweeps softly 
through it.  The doors of this corridor are stained with something dark and 
sinister looking.  The iron bolts on the doors look like they were rusted 
several centuries ago.  The ground floor Divination classroom is off to the 
west, while an open courtyard is to the east.  The corridor stretches to the 
north and south.

either end of the passage.  The air is cold, but soft.  Small fragments of 
dust can be seen floating through the air.  Large tapestries cover the walls 
to try and hold in any warm air.  The corridor stretches off to the north

and at large intervals over the stone floor.  The stone walls are dry, and 
the bricks of which they are composed are evenly pressed.  Grime resides in 
almost every nook and the passage gives an impression of darkness, despite 
the slit windows.  The hallway continues to the north and south, while 
another corridor branches off to the east.

    <desc>A large, open courtyard is situated in this hollow of the castle's 
architecture.  White flagstones are neatly paved on the ground, and are 
lightly marked by the daily scuffle of students which rolls over them.  They 
form a neat square in which a finely trimmed lawn resides.  Around the edges 
of the courtyard, flowering bushes rise out of the soil and ivy sneakily 
climbs the stone walls.  A large clock face looks down on everything, and 
its large pendulum swings back and forth at the foot of it with painstaking 
precision.  Corridors lead off in all directions, and the entrances to them 
are marked with white stone pillars.  There are also corridors and rooms 
which are contained high within the walls enclosing the courtyard, their 
windows marking the stone at frequent intervals.  Tall, pointed towers loom 
over the skyline in all directions.  One may move along to the north, east, 
south, west, and north-east.

    <desc>In the centre of this section of courtyard there is, directly opposite the 
white pillars leading back into the castle to the south, a small, limestone, 
birdfeeder.  It is a deep basin resting on the outstretched wings of an owl 
poised as about to take off.  The owl's talons form the base of the feeder 
and do not look as though they have been moved from the white flagstone, on 
which they stand, for many years.  On either side of the exit to the south 
the flowering bushes border the courtyard with mottled lilac blooms.  The 
courtyard continues to the north, east, west, northeast and northwest, while 
the passage into the castle is to the south.

    <desc>The white flagstones in this section of courtyard show a well-worn path 
between the southern and eastern entrances into the castle.  On either side 
of these entrances the lilac-flowering plants border the courtyard.  On a 
window ledge, some ways up the eastern wall, a large pile of bird droppings 
can be seen.  Towards the north a large fountain is visible, while to the 
west there is a bird feeder.  There are exits to the south and east that 
lead back into the castle and north, west and northwest into other areas of 
the courtyard.

    <desc>Taking up most of the room in this section of courtyard is a monumental 
fountain.  The white flagstone forms a path, between the fountain and the 
border of shrubs, wide enough for three people to walk side-by-side.  The 
edge of the fountain is wide enough to sit along and in the centre is a 
fish, resting on its tail, with water pouring up from its mouth.  Visible to 
the southwest is a bird feeder and to the far west is a topiary obelisk.  To 
the north and east are white pillars marking the exits back into the castle. 
 The flagstone courtyard carries on to the south, west and southwest.

    <desc>Quite a few of the white flagstones in this part of the courtyard are 
brighter than the others having been replaced in recent years.  The north 
wall is hedged by lilac-flowering shrubbery either side of the exit into the 
castle, which is marked by two white pillars.  The ivy from the surrounding 
walls has wound its way over the pillars and partly obscures the upper 
portion of the passageway.  To the east, a large fountain is visible, to the 
south there is a bird feeder and to the west is a topiary obelisk.  The 
flagstone heads off into the castle towards the north, and the courtyard 
continues to the east, south, west, southeast and southwest.

    <desc>In the northwest corner of this part of the courtyard there is a very tall 
topiary obelisk.  Each side is roughly a metre wide and it grows straight 
up, through the flagstone.  The surrounding stones are in disarray; almost 
as though the obelisk pushed right through them.  The north and west walls 
are bordered by the same lilac-flowering bushes that edge along the rest of 
the courtyard.  In the centre of each of those walls are exits that lead off 
into the castle.  Standing tall beside each of these passageways are 
towering white pillars.  Visible to the south is a large clock set against a 
western wall and to the southeast is an ornate bird feeder.  The courtyard 
lies to the east, south, southeast and west.  An entrance to the castle is 
north.

    <desc>The stones which brick the walls are dripping with damp moss clinging 
between widening cracks.  The cracks in the walls allow drafts to sweep 
through the passage and the stone walls amplify the smallest of noises.  
Water seeping between the stones slowly slides down the walls to pool at the 
bottom of the stairs.  Trickling water has created a slippery slime that 
makes it hard to ascend or descend the stairs.  To the west is the entrance 
hall, while the stairs lead downward to the kitchens and the Hufflepuff 
common room.

    <desc>The large grey stones that have been used to build the walls, ceiling and 
floor in this passage have exceptionally smooth faces.  There's not a 
chipped piece of stone to be seen.  The floor is covered with a hall runner 
of midnight black, bordered by green dragon scales.  It starts near the west 
entrance and disappears in the east.  Set low along the southern wall is a 
long rectangular mirror.  It runs the full length of the corridor and has 
been placed in such a position as to reflect the feet of passers-by.  Also 
along the south wall are four sturdy, simple iron candelabras standing upon 
the stone floor.  To the north is an exit to a courtyard and the corridor 
continues to the east and west.

    <desc>The fat grey stones in this part of the castle frame two, pitiful, grimy 
windows that look over a courtyard to the north.  The windows are square and 
hung on either side of the northern exit.  Above them are rectangular air 
vents covered with rusty iron mesh.  Running from east to west, and 
continuing through the doorways, is a hall runner of the deepest black, 
edged in vile green dragon scale.  The ceiling of the corridor is tall and 
square and built of the same swollen stones that make up the walls and 
floor.  Four, tall, simple, solid-looking iron candelabras are standing 
along the southern wall.  There is an exit to a courtyard to the north and 
the corridor continues to the east and west.

    <desc>There are small cracks in the stones low to the ground in this corridor.  
While they're not overly large, they are big enough allow in dirt from the 
outside.  There are smallish piles pushed hard up against the walls and some 
of the dirt has been trampled into the fine hall runner that runs into the 
passage from the west and finishes shortly before the eastern exit.  The 
runner is dirty black and its border is green dragon skin.  Light spills 
onto the floor from iron candelabras placed upon the floor along the edge of 
the southern wall.  On either side of the exit leading out to a courtyard, 
in the north, are tall, narrow gaps that are lined with silvery-gauze.  The 
corridor also continues to the east and west.

    <desc>Though there are no physical indicators as to where it originated, a 
consistent breeze buffed a high sheen upon the stones comprising the floor 
and walls of the corridor.  The few torches set along the breezeway are in a 
perpetual struggle against the wind: the wind determinedly extinguishing a 
torch and the flame tenaciously flickering back to life.  There are two 
sqare portals; a begrimed one leading west and a sooty one leading north.

    <desc>Beginning on the north side of the corridor a fading, Common Welsh Green 
Dragon is etched along the white walls.  His thick, powerful tail creeps 
toward the south meeting his back feet and torso.  His figure, revealing 
smooth, green skin, stretches along the south exit and commences along the 
opposite wall.  Again at the north end, opposite his tail, his monstrous 
face is set at a roar.  His eyes look as if they once held jewels that had 
long since been pried out.  The entire engraving is lackluster from neglect 
and is chipped in several places.  The dragon's mouth emits etched dull 
flames across the ceiling which illuminate the room in a strange, red glow.  
The exits are north at his mouth, south at his back feet, and along his 
torso to the west.

    <desc>. The corridor is quite narrow and bleak, though strongly lighted by the 
number of torches that rest in brackets on the stone walls.  A snake-like 
plant, resembling ivy, creeps up one of the walls and branches out across 
the ceiling.  The sides of the floor are littered with small pieces of stone 
leaving scars upon the original stone faces.  The Courtyard is visible 
through the few slit-windows along one side.  A draft runs through the 
corridor carrying a distinct yet strangely unidentifyable scent in the air.

    <desc>A gentle current of fresh, clean air flows through the long dim corridor.  
Cool clean water runs slowly down the moss-laden walls, forming small 
puddles as it collects on the floor.  Away from the puddles, the smooth stone 
floor is a dark creamy colour, and covered in bits of grit and grime.  An 
intricate pattern of spider webs cover the smooth stone ceiling.  A 
beautiful picture on the wall depicts a phoenix bursting into flames as it 
is being reborn.

being littered with grit, pebbles, and fallen stone, is clear of debris and 
very smooth. Similar to the floor, the walls are smooth and are 
ivory-coloured. On the ceiling resides a marble carving embedded into it 
which portrays a young wizard using his wand to bewitch a candle.

    <desc>The air is musty and heated; there is no breeze. Light from several flame 
torches flickers lazily over the long passageway, picking out shadows made 
from the grooves and markings upon the stone walls. Moss creeps through some of 
them, and snakes across the ceiling, branching out widely. There are some 
slit windows at one side, and a strange looking plant is slyly making its 
way into one of them.

    <desc>The dank dreariness of the red sandstone floor and walls seems intensified 
by the mud between the floor's stones.  A couple of torches light the 
corridor, but they appear to be laboring under the decay in the air.  A lone 
suit of armour, rusty and corroded, stands in the passageway.  When a person 
passes by, this acrimonious armour bellows insults: &quot;That's right, keep 
walking, just ignore the oxidizing suit of armour.&quot;  &quot;Hey, jerk, don't you 
see me decomposing here?&quot;  &quot;Must be nice to be able to bend your limbs!&quot;  A 
grimy archway leads west and a moist archway east.  The door to the south 
leads to the Divination Classroom.

    <desc>The pasageway is well-lighted by a dozen torches clasped in iron brackets 
shaped as praying hands.  A portrait of a monk hangs underneath each 
bracket.  At first glance, the hall seems meticulously cared for.  Instead, 
the brightness of the light tricks the casual observer from noticing the 
grime in the corners and between each stone comprising the floor and walls.  
The monks in the portraits continually mutter under their breath, &quot;All this 
filth, filth I tell you.&quot;  The monks walk to the other portraits whispering 
loudly that the muck surrounding them is indicative of the putrefaction of 
the outside world.  The charred exit leads west, the grimy one east, and the 
slate exit goes to the north.

    <desc>Grey slate runs the length of the corridor: floor, walls, and ceiling.  It 
resembles a giant chalkboard, which is its purpose.  Messages are written 
with an invisible hand and disappear into the wall for another message to be 
displayed.  &quot;Homework today, play tomorrow.&quot;  &quot;No running in the hallways.&quot;  
&quot;Did you remember your quills?&quot;  &quot;Have a nice day.&quot;  There is a solid oak 
pocket door to the east and two slate roundtop archways lead north and

    <desc>Crisp, green grass springs up all around the floor, cushioning all who walk 
or sit here.  Large trees litter the area, stretching their limbs towards 
the celestial ceiling.  Rocks and stumps are scattered about, providing 
something for the dweller to sit upon.  Earthy aromas linger lazily in the 
air, tingling the senses.  When the lights are on, the ceiling illuminates 
this space by replicating sunny skies.  When the lights are lowered, the 
heavens grow dark and stars begin to twinkle.  The doors to the north and 
east lead out into the corridors.

    <desc>A gentle breeze blows in through the large plate glass windows artistically 
built into the wall.  A large clock looms down from overhead, the routine 
ticking of its large pendulum echoes throughout the corridor.  The smooth 
stone floor is well kept and carefully polished, save a few stray pebbles 
lingering in the joint where the wall meets the floor.  The walls and 
ceiling are carefully engraved with magical scenes of beauty and splendor.  
Small burning torches hang from the walls at different intervals.  A bonny 
courtyard can be seen through a stone archway to the east.

    <desc>A cold draft blows through the corridor, sweeping dust and dirt into an 
ungraceful dance.  Droplets collect on the ceiling, and occasionally they 
build up and let go to join the growing puddle on the floor.  Flickering 
light from the bright torches dances all around and illuminates the moisture 
residing in corners and cracks.  The air is weighted down with a musty 
scent, and breathing is difficult.  The moss which has crept in is brown and 
dead, as is most of this corridor.

    <desc>A flat, white light fills the room, reflecting dully off the dark, panelled 
walls.  A worn, polished, wooden table rests in the centre of the room, 
covered in bits of old parchment and quills.  An odd assortment of dark 
wooden chairs are scattered throughout the room.  An enormous oak desk sits 
in a corner with neatly stacked supplies upon it.  A small fireplace, 
casting the only illumination in this drab room, is built into the wall 
opposite the entrance; an enormous cauldron emits a pleasant aroma.  A 
myriad of cloaks hang in an uninviting wardrobe.  To the north lies a dark, 
wooden door.

    <desc>Along the eastern wall grandiose casement windows exhibit the magnificent 
courtyard beyond.  Each of the four windows has one of the House emblems 
engraved upon it.  The floors and walls are composed of cobalt-blue stones.  
Shrill, little giggles seem to originate from nowhere.  If, however, the 
ceiling is inspected, the pesky din disturbing an otherwise tranquil chamber 
is easily ascertained.  Etched into the ceiling are the images of dozens of 
Cornish Pixies.  Constantly moving, as if in flight, these pointed-faced 
creatures snigger at any human beneath them.  To the east lies the courtyard. 
A Moorish archway leads north while the perfectly square opening leads south.

    <desc>With wide, clear windows opening up to the courtyard, this classroom shows a 
delicate dichotomy of light and darkness.  The room brightens from the door 
to the centre of the room, then starts to recede into shadow at the far 
corners.  Near the door, on the East wall, the windows look out into the 
courtyard.  On the far south wall, a large chalkboard stretches the length 
of the wall.  Across from the door on the west wall, three large shelves 
filled with hundreds of books line the wall.  On the northern wall another 
blackboard stretches across the wall.  In front of the wall sits a large 
wooden desk with a chair.  In the classroom proper are rows of desks and 
chairs for the students.  The floor is made of a hard, dark wood.  The large 
wooden door to the east leads out into the courtyard.

    <desc>This is a relatively narrow, windowless passageway.  Its lack of width and 
windows give the passage a cramped feeling.  Running the length of the 
corridor is a series of uneven scorch marks at varying heights.  In some 
places the marks stretch from the floor to the ceiling, while in other 
places they are barely visible, giving the corridor an aged look.  The 
scorches mark all of the walls and are punctuated by four torches that line 
either side.  The torches themselves are intact and in perfect working 
order.  While the ceiling and floor appear to be unscathed, they are visibly 
worn.  The floor is worn from foot traffic.  To the north is an unused 
classroom and to the south is the Ravenclaw Tower, while a passage extends 
on to the east.

    <desc>Flickering light reflects from the moist patches on the stone walls.  
Occasionally, the damp builds up and a faint dripping noise can be heard 
where it joins the puddles at the edge of the gritty floor.  Clumps of 
grey-green dirt hide under benches and in the corners, as well as a few dust 
bunnies.  A faint squeaking noise accompanies the dripping; it seems there 
are one or two hidden rats or mice here.  The corridor spreads out to the 
north, south, and west.

    <desc>The floor consists of Trassic Sandstone, dark brown in colour.  The walls 
are plastered white, which, in actuality, are closer to a dim, yellowish 
colour due to years of neglect.  In the plaster Frescos have been painted on 
each of the walls, one playing off the other.  On one side an enormous, 
slathering werewolf stares aggressively at the opposite wall.  He paces back 
and forth, looking for a way to the wall across from him.  Facing the 
werewolf is a frail, old wizard meekly holding his ancient wand and 
constantly looking for ways to escape.  Three tiny, rectangular windows emit 
the only illumination this corridor receives and, at times, the wizard 
actually attempts to scramble up to the windows, as if he could escape.  Two 
dark, narrow exits lead east and west.  A dark, heavy, unadorned door leads 
north.

    <desc>The corridor is warm and inviting with mahogany panelling along the walls 
and red granite floors.  Iron brackets hold flaming Bludger-shaped torches 
allowing the copper statue of Felix the Fortunate to be seen.  Felix, in his 
Appleby Arrows robes, holds a broom in one hand and a Golden Snitch in the 
other.  Felix, bent over in a grimace, holds his Snitched-hand across his 
belly.  Students who haven't studied for their tests rub Felix's hand for 
luck.  Looking at Felix will explain this odd phenomenon.  The slate, 
roundtop archway leads south.  The oval portal leads west, while the dark, 
narrow exit leads east.

      <desc>In 1932, in a game against the Vratsa Vultures, Felix was struck off his 
broom by a Bludger twenty feet in the air.  He fell to the ground with a 
resounding thud.  Amazingly, in his misery, he felt a tickling at his belly. 
 Feeling at his stomach region, he pulled out the Snitch.  Felix ended the 
sixteen day game 'capturing' the Snitch, in what is still called to this 
day, &quot;the luckiest catch in Quidditch history.&quot;

    <desc>Three painted portraits hang directly opposite three round windows in this 
large, animated corridor.  The cheerful portraits depict three similar 
looking witches, all with brilliant blond hair and large, jolly faces.  All 
three witches are wearing pristine white robes emblazoned with light blue, 
embroidered snowflakes.  The portraits are hung over a smooth wall and are 
reflected in the highly polished glass in each of the windows.  Positioned 
between each window is a small, shallow alcove.  Each alcove holds a number 
of candles of the same blue shade as the snowflakes.  Standing at attention 
directly in front of the centre window is a single, solitary suit of armour. 
 The passage extends on to the east and the west.  To the north is an old 
broom cupboard.

illumination.  By the flickering candle light, you can make out what appears 
to be several pale green glass bottles next to a dusty iron cauldron.  They 
have been left for ages on a dark wood sideboard on the eastern side.  The 
walls are bare of decoration, but the moss growing through the cracks makes 
a webbed pattern of bright green.  The moss adds some life to the otherwise 
dreary and deserted corridor.  The carpet runner is threadbare, although, it 
appears it was gold framed with brown at some point.  An archway covered 
with cobwebs sits on the western wall leading down a corridor.  The passage 
extends to the north and to the south.

    <desc>The floor of this corridor is smooth and clean, but pebbles clutter the 
sides where it joins the walls.  Some kind of plant snakes its way across 
the damp ceiling, which is producing cold droplets of musty water.  The 
plant growing in the hallway makes the room tranquil and relaxing, 
making it a great place to sit and rest or study.  The corridor spreads out 
to the east, west, and south.

    <desc>There are many flame torches lighting up this passage.  They give the place 
a warm atmosphere.  The walls, of dry white stone, are almost unmarked and 
obviously well kept.  The floor is also smooth and even, as is the ceiling, 
which is host to a small number of picturesque carvings.  Wide arches arc 
across the ceiling, supporting and stabilizing the walls.  The long hall 
continues to the west and east, while to the north is the North Tower.

consists of large grey flagstone slabs at the base of a narrow winding 
staircase.  The steps are large and close together, with a thin stone 
handrail running along one side, spiraling upward with the stairs.  Large 
clear windows can be seen at different intervals along the staircase, 
allowing bright sunlight in during the day.  Large torches hang between each 
of the windows, burning only at night.  The staircase leads up to the next

western wall and ceiling are in a black-and-white checkerboard pattern.  On 
the western wall and ceiling are human-sized Wizard Chess pieces, creating 
two separate games.  The pieces are at various places on both boards since 
students, as they walk through the hall, command the pieces to move in a 
perpetual game.  There are cushy sofas and chairs set about the room for 
students who would like to sit and play a game instead of just instructing a 
knight or pawn to move as they walk through.  To the north lies a perfectly 
square opening, while a golden arch allows one to travel east.  To the south 
an opening in the shape of a treble clef grants access to that area.

between each case are wide enough to accommodate windows and candle 
recesses.  The floor is a well-worn green-slate flagstone.  In the centre of 
the hall, encased in thick glass, is an energetic working model of the 
heavens.  Circling the model and spinning in opposite directions are two 
gleaming golden rings.  South is a dead end while to the north the corridor 
extends past the courtyard.  To the east is the Astronomy Tower staircase.

    <desc>A wide circular room lays before you, the air is still and peaceful save for 
a burning sphere in the centre the size of a Snitch.  It burns brightly 
with a violet flame casting a soft light around the windowless room.  The 
open floor is a singular slab of smooth white and grey marble, the seemingly 
random patterns of grey circles and white expanses make up a detailed map of 
the moon.  The continuous broad stone wall surrounding the room is broken up 
by large wooden supports, held in place with thick iron bolts.  There are a 
number of cabinets bearing intricate globes and gyroscopes.  A few musty 
bookshelves containing massive volumes of star charts and tattered scrolls 
stand nearby.  Wrapped around the room, a stone stair case made of floating, 
unconnected steps spirals upwards and an arch opens out to the west.

    <desc>Short, grubby, and made from grey limestone, this corridor contains only two 
objects of interest: tapestries.  Next to each tapestry is a diminutive 
torch eking the tiny bit of light available.  On one wall hangs a tapestry 
depicting four petrified children either running from or withering in front 
of two fearsome trolls lumbering for them.  The tapestry on the opposite 
wall portrays a bewitching feline leading a flustered, lost, yet grateful, 
wizard out of the woods.  The oval exit leads west and the wide exit takes 
one south.  The decomposing pea-green door, with a sign reading &quot;I am 
watching YOU&quot;, leads to Filch's Office.

    <desc>Several oval windows, with the Hogwarts design etched into them, run along 
the top of the walls filtering in the outside light.  Thick wax candles 
floating around these windows cast an orangish hue upon the oak-panelled 
walls.  Beneath the windows, plastered to the walls, are so many portraits 
that it is difficult to even see the panelling.  These are the pictures of 
past, great teachers of Hogwarts.  Some of the depictions look regal, others 
annoyed at students running through the corridor, while a few of the 
professors' visages are cunning, even menacing.  An oval exit leads east.  A 
very long, slender opening leads west.  A solid oak door with the Hogwarts' 
Crest upon it opens to the staff room.

    <desc>Not exactly opposite one another, about halfway along the corridor, are twin 
fountains set into the walls.  They are small, not very impressive, and the 
bronze features have turned quite green with age.  Both of the fountains are 
similar, with water pouring from the mouth of a Bicorn's head, which looms 
over a thick-rimmed stone reservoir.  There are no windows to speak of, save 
for four narrow, horizontal slits, the width of four human fingers from the 
ceiling.  Each wall has two large torches and a row of stubby candles in an 
iron box above each fountain.  On each side of both fountains, carved into 
the stone wall, is a wand.  Each wand is pointing upward and slightly inward 
towards the fountains.

    <desc>The corridor is wide and spacious.  The floor, walls, and ceiling are 
covered in the same lurid wallpaper.  With a mustard-yellow fleur-de-lis 
pattern in raised felt, the background is azure.  The passageway is brightly 
lighted, but from an unknown source.  Upon careful observation one may see a 
flicker in the wallpaper ...  Could there be a torch set there?  There is a 
plush, overstuffed sofa along one wall and three matching box-chairs.  Good 
luck discovering these areas of rest, however, they blend perfectly with the 
wallpaper.  The exits are East and West for those able to find them ...

    <desc>There are two large, roomy alcoves on each wall.  These four alcoves reach 
from the floor to just under the ceiling.  They are spaced equally apart; 
however, each alcove is at a diagonal from its partner on the opposing wall. 
 The interior of each alcove is decorated with an intricate patchwork crest 
for each of the school's houses.  Two-thirds of the way up each wall, from 
end to end, is a shallow channel edged in a darker stone than that of the 
wall.  The channel follows the arch of the alcoves and is sealed shut at 
both ends of the corridor.  Apart from a little dust, the channel is empty.  
The corridor is wide enough for five average-sized third years to stand 
side-by-side quite comfortably.  The passage extends to the north and south.

    <desc>Caen stone, creamy yellow in colour, covers the floors, walls, and ceiling 
of this Gryffindor room.  Lamps light this smallish study room with ancient 
tables and spindly chairs of cherry wood.  Against the east wall a fireplace 
crackles busily from flames that warm the room.  Large, squashy armchairs 
are scattered in front of the fireplace, books resting at their sides, left 
by their classmates.  A large red and gold hanging of the Gryffindor Crest 
hangs above the fireplace.  A massive scarlet chalkboard, riddled with 
graffiti, hangs upon a wall with gold-coloured chalk in its tray.  The 
scarlet door exits to the west and stone steps lead upward.

      <desc>The chalkboard is riddled with graffiti.  Some people have drawn pictures, 
quotes, signatures, etc.  Written in a corner of the board a conversation 
follows: &quot;Ron Weasley was here.&quot;  Underneath that it says, &quot;Obviously you 
were here, Ron, as you just wrote that.&quot;  &quot;Hermione, it's just something 
people write.&quot;  &quot;I know, Harry, but I think it's silly.&quot;  &quot;It's supposed to 
be silly, why don't you learn to relax?&quot;  &quot;Fine, Ron, if you think that is a 
sign of relaxation then: Hermione Granger, Harry Potter, and Ron Weasley 
were here writing stupid things on this board.&quot;  &quot;She's never going to get 
it, Harry; I mean never.&quot;  &quot;Let it go, mate.  Let it go.&quot;

    <desc>Paper, files, and envelopes are strewn across the small room.  A large, oak 
desk rests in the centre of the room, stacked high with half-filled 
detention slips and a few broken quills.  A large, metal, filing cabinet 
stands close behind it, each drawer labelled with a different letter of the 
alphabet.  A pair of ancient shackles dangles lazily from the ceiling, 
sparkling from someone's meticulous care and patiently awaiting use.  A 
small, wooden door sits in the western wall, painted a light grey in a 
failed attempt to blend it in with the wall.

      <desc>Extending down on chains from the ceiling of the room, these shackles look 
to be in good condition.  Well-oiled and cared for, the shackles are 
apparently kept in a ready to use state.  Hanging far from the floor, only 
the tallest of adults would be able to touch their feet when strung up by 
these shackles.

    <desc>This empty classroom is quiet and cold.  Dust inhabits everything from the 
old wooden floor to the small wooden desks.  On the far east wall are 
multiple windows that are very dirty.  One of them is broken and allows the 
wind from outside to blow in and gives dim light.  Deep in the northeast 
corner of the room is a spiders web which covers a small hole in the wall.  
To the west is a bookcase with small withered plants in pots on top.  The 
only exit is to the east.

with dust, the books are in excellent condition.

    <desc>The floor of this corridor is patterned with a mosaic design of interwoven 
squares alternating in colours from yellow to black to off-white.  It is 
edged at the west end of the corridor by a border of thick, black granite 
blocks, while the pattern itself extends through the eastern doorway.  The 
upper end of the north wall is home to a row of six lanterns.  Three sides 
of the lanterns are made of ceramic, which has had a delicate pattern cut 
into it, allowing the light to spill into the room and bounce off the 
windows directly opposite.  The fourth side of the lanterns, facing the 
hall, are paned with pale pink glass.  Standing on either side of the exit 
to a courtyard, in the southern wall, are two suits of armour who's shields 
bear the school crest.  The corridor also continues to the east and west.

    <desc>Along the southern wall are two large, arched windows on either side of a 
door, and one, smaller, rectangular window above it.  The smaller window is 
barred from the outside and partly obscured by dust and cobwebs.  Dangling 
on chains, from the stone at the top of each arched window, are pink 
crystals.  Decorating the floor is an intricate mosaic of knotted squares in 
subdued shades of yellows and browns and creams.  The ceiling is rounded and 
smooth.  On the north wall, quit near the ceiling, is a row of stubby 
candles on an iron platform and boxed in by a thick mesh.  There is a door 
to the north, and to the south, which leads to a courtyard.  The corridor 
continues to the east and west.

    <desc>. A shadowy light flickers through a pair of small windows, tiredly 
illuminating the room.  Leaky pipes surrounding the room have caused it to 
become soggy and mildewed.  The cracked, grey, stone walls are slick to the 
touch and the cobbled floor has many puddles upon it.  The room is utterly 
barren, apart from the few rotting tables and littered pieces of parchment 
that lie forgotten on the floor.  The only exit is to the south.

    <desc>Flickering torches hang in their supports along the walls, casting shadows 
over the dark stone.  An alcove houses a bust of Salazar Slytherin, his face 
set in a scowl.  The bust is set atop a shining column of marble, obviously 
cared for because of its reflective sheen.  The stones on the walls have 
been worn smooth over time from various hands running along them between 
classes.  The floor gently slopes downward, leading deeper into the 
dungeons.  Hissing sounds come from a long portrait of a full-grown dragon, 
specifically a Hebridean Black.  One may exit to the south or to the west.

The granite bust of Salazar Slytherin dominates the area. His imposing gaze tracks every student that passes. He has noble, sharply defined features and a short curl of a beard. The figure is hooded and wears a vicious scowl.

      <desc>Almost thirty feet in length, the black, coarse-scaled dragon sits up in a menacing pose.  His enormous, bat-like wings spread wide.  His eyes glow a luminous purple and sharp-edged points stretch along his spine.  The tip of his tail holds an arrow-shaped spike.

    <desc>The faint smell of mildew lingers in the air.  Two, sputtering torches sit 
in rusty brackets.  The trickling sound of water oozing from the dark, moist 
walls is present, though the hallway itself is surprisingly clean for an 
old, dank dungeon.  The smooth ceiling reaches out into the darkness.  A 
large, iron door sits to the east and water drips slowly down across its 
face.  Box archways indicate exits to the north or south.

      <desc>A large, iron door occupies the east wall. Embedded into the wall, this door reeks of decay and age. A brownish discolouration seeps down the door as rust deposits mark water lines of ages past. A large, tarnished ring is placed in the right side of the door and in the upper middle sits a small, barred window.

    <desc>The most noticeable thing about this narrow passageway is the way it appears 
to curve like a snake winding its way through the forest.  However, upon 
second glance instead of coiling or bending, this corridor is straight.  
Thin sheets of a silk-like cloth hang over the walls, ripples flowing 
through them with every breeze traveling by.  The ceiling casts a faint 
emerald hue that travels down its length, while two torches cast a dancing 
shadow on the walls and floor.  The passage winds its way to the north and 
south.

    <desc>The walls lining this spacious corridor are composed of black, brown, and 
white bricks, which continually rearrange themselves into the shapes of 
unusual magical beasts.  The two walls synchronize to always display the 
same image and a low, rumbling noise echoes down the hallway whenever the 
bricks switch positions.  The floor and the ceiling are both made of 
polished, black marble, that reflects dark shadows of the images on the 
walls.  Two torches cast a dancing shadow on the ceiling and walls.  The 
only exits are to the north and south.

    <desc>This passage winds its way lazily ahead, the hewn stone floor patterned with 
moss and age.  A chilling wind slips around like a silent intruder, 
whispering laments to the occupants of the passage.  Angular walls jut out 
from both sides of the corridor, glimmering faintly in the light from the 
sparsely placed torches.  Overhead, sharp rock formations cast cruel shadows 
along every surface.  The exits are through jagged arches to the east and 
west.

    <desc>Unforgiving stone floors stretch ahead into the dark, echoing the sounds of 
the passersby. To one side, a crudely cut archway lies - awating someone to 
cross its threshold. Straight ahead, dimly lit by the sparse torches on the 
wall, lies more lenght of passage. The slightest linger of mildew tickles 
the senses, while water trickles languidly down the brash, rough walls.

    <desc>Brisk, splintered stone floors lie below .. marred from age and use. 
Lifeless, dark green moss sprinkles itself vainly over the cracks in the 
stone. The pungent aroma of stale, damp air waifts its way around the 
passage. To the right bends another unknown passage, daring the persuer to 
enter through its darkness. Light from sparatic torches float their way 
unevenly across the sides of the walls, just slightly reflecting the light 
from the flames.

    <desc>A cold, stone base is below your feet chipping with age and use.  Gaping 
cragged walls hug either side, chilled water trickling the surface.  The 
scent of mildew floats with the draft that pierces its way through the 
passage.  Two torches cast a dancing shadow on the ceiling and walls.  To 
the east, the smoothed edges create a stone archway stained green from age 
and dampness, and is set with a simple wooden door.  To the west is a 
scabrous elliptical opening leading further into the dungeon.  Darkness 
crawls forth across the flag stone floor to the south, blocking view from 
what lies ahead.

a different shade of grey.  The ceiling is dark and low, which gives the

      <desc>Short and shabby, this wizard has a scabby, ugly face with a scraggly beard. His dirty, blue, robes look two sizes too big for him. His hatless head shows his balding scalp. In his left hand he is holding a light coloured wand which he has thrust out before him.

    <desc>This T-shaped passageway travels both west and south, and to the east is a 
simple, wooden door.  The walls and ceiling are made of plain, hewn stone.  
The floor, made of clean, stone slabs, runs straight and even in all 
directions.  A single torch and bracket sit on the north wall.

mold grow subtley from the cracks in the stone. Jagged walls lean out into 
the passage, water dripping relentlessly from the edges. Flames dance from 
torches that are scattered along the walls .. flickering in the draft that 
waifts through the passage.

    <desc>With a dreary and drab appearance, this passageway holds a sense of musty 
dampness.  Crudely carved slabs of rocks, jutting out at odd angles, 
construct the unadorned walls.  Torches, sitting in dark brackets, light the 
way on each wall with their flickering lights casting dancing shadows upon 
the smooth and polished stone floor.  A single, iron door stands at the far 
north end of the hallway, which also extends eastward.

devoid of a torch, hangs off the west wall.  Against the north wall sits a

    <desc>Long, descending, stone steps arc side to side the entire length of the 
room.  Elongated, ancient, wooden tables settle themselves systematically 
along the length of the steps - ranging forward, only stopping to give way 
to the east end of the room.  The dark ceiling reaches overhead in a low 
arch.  The ragged walls, an array of labeled jars and boxes lined neatly 
upon them, display their mysterious, powerful contents.  The far end of the 
room boasts one, large, black cauldron with a smoking and bubbling, blue 
liquid shimmering in the dimly lit classroom.  A dazzling, warm fire 
crackles below the cauldron - lighting the classroom, and making it warm and 
perfumed.  Behind the cauldron sits some furniture.  Along the west wall of 
the classroom is a large, wooden cabinet and at the northwestern wall is a 
large stone basin with a wide mouthed gargoyle sitting above it.  The exit 
to the room is to the west.

      <desc>Made of the darkest, blackest metal, this cauldron radiates powerful magic. Its exterior is covered with various runes and markings. Along the top edge of the cauldron an etching of a snake moves in a complete circle around it. Peering into the liquid, you can see glimpses of changing places and locations.

The smell of ancient forest seeps out of every crack and a vibration of powerful magic seems to radiate from their wooden exterior. Pewter cauldrons sit on each table top, awaiting use.

- parched with lack of use.

    <desc>Cold, stone walls create the barrier that entombs these quarters. Moss grows 
lazily between the cracks and edges of the floor and walls. A chilling draft 
circulates its way around the dungeon, bringing with it the faintest smell 
of mildew and copper.

    <desc>An archway stretches over a doorway to the right leading towards a heavy, 
wooden door adorned with iron latches and hinges. Torches become a bit more 
abundant the farther one looks down this passage, their light reflecting off 
of the surfaces that surround. A chilling draft waifts its way through the 
area, with the faintest smell of mildew floating along with it.

    <desc>To the south of this corridor, the crest bearing the emblem of the House of 
Slytherin juts out fiercely from a large wooden door. Faint scratching 
noises from mice and rats scurrying down the length of the corridor can be 
heard from further down the hall. Cobwebbed suits of armor stand at uneven 
intervals along both walls, and the occasional ominous creak of rusty metal 
can be detected as the suits sway under the weight of years of neglect. A 
lone torch mounted on the north wall lights the immediate vicinity, but the 
light fades down the length of the corridor, and the distance holds only 
mysterious, blurry figures and a sense of powerful but unfriendly darkness.

    <desc>The Slytherin Common room is a low-ceilinged, underground affair, stretching 
longer than it is wide.  The walls are hewn from rough, gray stone, standing 
thick and trapping the stagnant air inside the room.  Spherical, 
jade-colored lamps hang from multitudes of thin, iron chains from the flat 
ceiling, illuminating the entire stretch in an eerie light.  At the very end 
of the room, a large, ornate fireplace provides a warm air to the otherwise 
tomblike room.  A verdant, detailed Slytherin banner hangs directly above 
it, its green tassels just touching the top of the mantlepiece.  Dotted all 
over the room, carved mahogany chairs of every imaginable variety are spread 
throughout, each with its own unique design.  A single, abnormally long sofa 
dominates the entire length of the southern wall, providing a small area of 
comfort towards any weary Slytherins who may come by.  A flight of stairs 
fashioned out of smoothened stone lead upwards on the eastern side, leading 
away from the still, muffled atmosphere.

    <desc>This corridor has no source of light, yet a glow seems to radiate from an 
unknown source. The walls are plain and painted black, as are the ceiling 
and floor. The darkness of this hallway gives it an eerie and haunting 
feeling. Next to the heavy wooden door at the north end is a tall, marble 
statue of a wizard carrying a lance. Its eyes seem to trace the movements of 
those who pass through this creepy passageway.

through this chilled chamber.  Highly polished, steel-based torches cast 
ominous flickering shadows over the surroundings.  Water drips from one of 
the basins dug into the stone sending stark, cold echoes ringing off the 
chamber walls.  A highly polished mirror sits directly above the sinks, the 
weak light glinting sharply off its surface, almost begging for an 
on-looker.  The exit lies through the door to the south.

    <desc>Polished stone covers the floor of the room. Rough, hewn walls jut out 
forming a barrier around the individual toilets - cutting them off as though 
made a pariah from their neighbors. Steel based torches scatter themselves 
along the walls, subtley spreading their light on the walls and floors. A 
long, rectangular piece of mirror stretches out across the wall opposite the 
stalls, gleaming in the light from the torches. Smooth, worn stone forms 
basins along the wall under the mirror. Spouts made from square-shaped, 
flattened holes bored into the walls to release water.

    <desc>The cement floor of this brightly lit corridor is cracked and chipped after 
years of being trodden on by the hurried footsteps of students. The air is 
cold and dry, as are the stone walls and ceiling. Heaps of dust, having 
accumulated in the corners over time, cause the place appear aged and 
unkept. A substantially thick layer of dust has settled itself upon the head 
and shoulders of a stone figure, which stands next to the wooden door on the 
north end of the passage way. Another wooden door leads out of the hallway 
on the west side, and is accompanied by a sign which reads &quot;Caution: Do not 
enter.&quot;

profusely - almost daring the user to lean against their uncomfortable 
surfaces.  Light lingers around faintly from the torches glimmering 
slightly, flickering in the draft that moves stealthily around the passage.  
To the East is what might be some sort of makeshift potions laboratory.

ingredients - chocolate, roses, plum pudding...  - which might have smelled 
good individually but, combined by some well-intentioned potion maker, 
produce a foul, unbearable odor.  A row of dirty cupboards line the wall; 
below this, the clutter of scientific equipment and books is so extreme that 
one might wonder if the corridor had been intentionally disordered.

    <desc>Strange paintings and weirdly woven tapestries blanket the walls of a 
crooked and winding hallway.  Some of the paintings' inhabitants stand 
upside down, gazing at the stone floor as if it were the ceiling.  The 
tapestries are full of strange figures that resemble neither man nor beast.  
The floor slopes gently upward for a distance, then the hallway twists 
sharply to the east.  The hallway is difficult to navigate at best and a 
single spiraling stairwell branches away from it, periodically shifting 
itself to align with another one of the doors below it.  This hall is sure 
to confuse those with a lack of directional sense.

    <desc>Torches line both sides of the hall and the flickering fires dimly lights a 
dirt floor and cold stone walls. An eerie grey statue of a hag in ragged 
robes stretches a bony, gnarled hand into the walking area. The statue has 
one false, pale green eye which moves despite the immobile form of the 
statue. The eye scans the length of the hallway and frequently fixes its 
shrewd stare on frightened passers by. Empty portrait frames of all shapes 
and sizes hang from the walls and the deserted corridor holds only empty 
echoes and a single, lonely statue. Rusted doors open to the north and 
south.

each with their corresponding house colors in the background, sparkling with 
gold along their edges. The badger and raven represent their houses along 
the bottom of the crest, each glinting with their guilded edges. A large &quot;H&quot;

    <desc>Somber gray walls are lit by ancient oil lamps suspended from the ceiling by 
heavy metal chains.  The shadowy light illuminates a portrait on the south 
wall.  A teenaged boy, dressed in a red and green plaid kilt, is leaning 
against a stone wall.  His pale blue eyes are looking away, but tears are 
clearly running down the side of his face.  Golden locks are tucked behind 
his ear and a lone stem of purple Heather is in his right hand.  Inscribed 
at the bottom of the gilded gold frame are the words, &quot;Per mere, Per 
terras&quot;.  Directly under the painting is a small table filled with votive 
candles and a medallion imprinted with a thistle.  The door way to the west 
is imprinted with faded Gaelic characters and the passage extends east.

    <desc>The upper walls in this corridor are home to a tiled mosaic.  The tiles are 
cream in colour and bordered by a black and white chequered pattern.  
Zooming lazily around the mosaic, and occasionally trailing his hands 
through the air, is a lonely Seeker made of black tiles.  There is no snitch 
to be seen.  Lining the walls are colourful pennants representing each of 
the houses accomplishments on the Quidditch Pitch.  Standing in pairs along 
the hallway are twelve great, claw-footed iron candelabras.  Each has room 
enough for three candles.  Emblazoned on the back of the door leading into 
this corridor is the Hogwarts school crest.  The crest looks as if it has 
been burnt into the wood.  East and west of here the passage extends on.

    <desc>A mural on the south wall of the corridor catches the eye.  It depicts a 
mountain stream struggling to break through the last of the winter ice.  
Water trickles down boulders into a small pool filled with pieces of ice 
that are just starting to melt away in the spring sun.  The north wall is a 
collection of three gigantic glass windows that add light and warmth to the 
room.  The corners of the windows have stained glass insets of bluebirds.  
The pale green curtains, tied back with silver cords, allow much light in 
during the day.  Warmed by the sun, the bare stone floor radiates heat.  The 
vaulted ceiling is almost four meters high and adds to the general airy 
feeling in the room.  Sconces filled with fresh flowers are attached to the 
walls on either side of the passage.  The corridor extends to the east and 
west.

    <desc>Indigo velvet curtains hide both of the dark stone walls of this short, wide 
corridor.  In one section on the north wall, the draperies have been pulled 
back and secured with golden tassels to reveal an ancient tapestry.  The 
faded scarlet background is embroidered with pale purple thistles.  A lone 
unicorn raised on its hind legs dominates the foreground.  Despite the age 
of the work, the blue eye still sparkle with life.  The white coat glistens 
as it romps through the tapestry.  Around its neck is a fine gold chain 
baring a charm in the shape of crown.  A single ivory votive candle is 
placed on a small mahogany table underneath the tapestry.  The entryways to 
the west and north ends of the hall are draped in fine gold silk embroidered 
with small crosses.

    <desc>Water is dripping somewhere in the distance.  A chill fills the long stone 
corridor.  A deep stone archway lies at the south end.  The west wall is 
decorated with tarnished short swords.  In the center of the display is a 
large round shield covered with leather.  Silver studs form circle and 
diamond patterns around the outside edge.  In the center is a large silver 
plate engraved with ancient symbols.  Behind the shield, two silver swords 
with richly decorated basket handles are crossed.  Their ends have been 
sharpened to dazzling points.  The eastern wall is home to a fine etching of 
a warrior.  He holds the selfsame shield that is featured on the opposite 
wall.  His leather armor has been pierced and blood is running from an open 
wound.  Candles fill a dusty pewter chandelier suspended from the center of 
the hallway, giving shadowy light to the cobwebbed corners of the hall, 
which extends to the north and south.

    <desc>The highly polished, cherry-wood floors of this corridor are inlaid with 
contrasting beech and mahogany woods in small, medallion-shaped patterns.  
Ethereal sequences of eight yellow-paned, pewter lanterns are attached to 
the walls at regular intervals.  On one side of the corridor are two, 
elongated notice boards.  They take up almost the entire length of the 
corridor and are framed by plum-stained wood.  Across the walkway, flanking 
a bust of Edgar Stroulger, inventor of the Sneakoscope, are two circular 
windows.  At their widest points, they rest only centimetres above the floor 
and finish just as the ceiling begins.  The upper half of each window is 
streaked with grime.  A corridor begins to the east while this corridor 
extends to the north and south.

    <desc>The smell from the kitchens down below wafts up through the open end of the 
corridor and flows down its length.  An old forgotten harpsichord sits in a 
corner.  A large, crackling fireplace on the east wall creates an atmosphere 
of warmth and cheeriness.  The fragrant smells and flickering light seep 
into the corners of the corridor, and even the paintings seem to give off a 
happy glow.  A portrait of a matronly witch in brick red robes tends to her 
children on the west wall, while a portly-looking man with rosy cheeks plays 
exploding snap with his friend in a painting above the fireplace.  The 
chatter of the painted children and the occasional bang as the exploding 
snap games come to an end add cheerful luster to the welcoming hall.  The 
exits lead to the south and west.

    <desc>The walls are made of pale golden sandstone.  Small triangular shaped 
windows allow sunlight to pour in near the top of the east wall.  The center 
window bears a gold overlay of a falcon in flight.  Symbols encased in ovals 
are etched into the stones under the windows.  The west wall is broken in 
two by a column standing from floor to ceiling.  It is not the Doric or 
ionic of the Greeks, but rather flower shaped.  It has a long stem with a 
bud, surrounded by sepals that have not yet bloomed near the ceiling.  The 
archways to the west and south are wider at the bottom and narrower at the 
top.  An ancient etching of an eye hangs above the north door.

    <desc>Next to each of the two doors leading into this corridor, cast in shadows, 
are deep recesses set into the wall, directly opposite one another.  Centred 
between the recesses are two pairs of smooth, towering stone pillars.  The 
pillars are built in the same material as the walls and ceiling; a rough 
sandstone.  The floor is made of grey and brown slate.  Half-way up the 
walls, painted on the stone, is a border of faded red wizard chess pieces.  
In between two of the pillars, on one side of the corridor, is a bust of the 
Wizard Chess Champion, Montague Knightley, quietly mumbling away.  An odd 
number of torches are attached to the opposite wall.  Exits lay to the east 
and west of here.

    <desc>A deep golden runner spans the length of the hall.  The corridor is brightly 
lit by huge brass lanterns that flicker every so often.  On the north wall 
is a painting framed in bronze of a young woman hanging laundry on a line 
outside.  She is dressed in a faded gray gown.  In the background is a small 
wooden farmhouse with a large brick chimney.  Small yellow chickens are 
pecking at the ground the woman's feet.  It looks as though she is singing 
while she works.  A large tabby cat is sunning himself near the open front 
door.  He is plainly ignoring the two field mice scampering about the 
painting.  The hall extends on to the west and to the east.

    <desc>The short hall is decorated festively in scarlet and royal blue.  Narrow 
stripped banners are placed in evenly spaced increments along both stone 
walls.  A checkered runner hides cold slab flooring.  In between the scarlet 
and royal blue banners are small oil paintings of fruits and vegetables.  On 
the south wall, two banners have been removed to accommodate a large oil 
painting depicting mealtime.  Servants dressed in gray are hastily setting a 
feast table.  The settings contain only plates, wine goblets, and silver 
knives.  The dinning room is decorated in a variety of plaid wall hangings.  
In the center of the oval table are several pewter pitchers and a large 
silver platter holding a gigantic haggis.  At close look, the stomach of the 
sheep appears to fidget.  A large set of oak doors mark the entrance to the 
Hospital Wing, while opposite the hall extends eastward.  Perpendicularly, 
the hall extends to the north and south.

    <desc>Etched into the ceiling of this corridor is a shallow relief depicting the 
various phases of the moon.  The carving of the full moon is fractured.  
There are five, large rectangular windows along one side of this corridor.  
A few of the sand-coloured stones in the window ledges are loose and a 
couple of them are even missing.  The three, centre windows share a 
leadlight scene of large, lilac flowers set against a background of green 
and gold.  On the opposite wall is a dark, pokey fireplace.  The fireplace 
is so small that not even a house elf could stand in it and still be clearly 
seen.  The iron grate and surrounding tiled hearth are muted against the 
ivory-coloured stone mantle.  The passage extends to the north and to the 
south.

    <desc>A thin metal trunk sits firmly against the east wall, leaving barely enough 
room to pass through the narrow corridor.  The trunk is propped open with a 
large green book that has been shoved between the hinges.  Hundreds of 
scrolls have been carelessly piled inside, to the point of overflowing onto 
the bare wooden floor.  Above the top of the trunk is a wooden framed 
painting.  A desk is pictured sideways and a wooden chair is pushed back, 
almost out of view.  On top of the desk is a scroll, much like the ones on 
the floor.  A quill rests on the scroll and a jar of ink has toppled over.  
The ink appears to be wet, as though someone has recently left in a hurry.  
There is a doorway west, opposite the trunk, and a brightly lit archway to 
the north.  Extending north and south is a continuation of the corridor.

ceiling.  There are narrow veins of gold, woven into the circular patterns 
on the floor, glinting in the lights from above and snaking their way under 
the walls.  On the south wall are three small portraits.  They're just big 
enough to show the faces of three middle-aged wizards all with dark, unkempt 
hair and cinnamon-coloured eyes.  Opening up this room, on the north wall, 
are two long windows placed either side of a solid oak door leading to the 
courtyard outside.  The windows reach from the floor to the ceiling and are 
the width of an average adult wizard.  The corridor also follows the castle 
to the east and west.

    <desc>The stones in the southern wall of this corridor have been carved out to 
resemble row upon row of books of varying heights.  The titles of the books 
are little more than illegible, shallow indentations on the faded, painted 
spines.  Above the highest row of books is a ceiling speckled with jagged 
orbs of silvery-starlight.  The lights follow the deep arch of the ceiling 
and are most concentrated at the arch's highest point.  The north wall has a 
door leading to the courtyard outside and five medium-sized arch windows.  
The doorway has been set slightly off-centre and is bordered by heavy grey 
stones.  The corridor also continues to the east and west.

    <desc>Behind the gentle spheres of shining light, floating serenely inches below 
the ceiling, etched into the stones, is the constellation of Leo; a faint 
outline of the beast has been rendered over the star chart.  Adding to the 
light given off from above are three, giant, iron hands, each holding a 
long, tapered red candle.  The hands have been placed at regular intervals, 
about two-thirds the way up the south wall and are secured in place by two 
fat spikes through each wrist.  On the opposite wall is a door leading to a 
courtyard.  On either side of the door are four medium-sized arched windows. 
 The floor is covered in a rich, red runner, patterned with small, white 
fleur-de-lis.  As well as the door the north, the corridor extends into the 
castle towards the east and west.

    <desc>White flagstones lead out onto an open grass area. Roses bloom on bushes at 
the sides, their pink petals contrasting the rich green leaves. The Hogwarts 
crest sits high on a towering wall, looking over the rest of the courtyard. 
White pillars with noticeable finger marks stand at intervals along the 
entrances, and passageways linking different towers run above them. A large 
clock opposes the school crest, its large pendulum dominating the far 
corridor. Large parts of the castle loom in from all directions.

entrance inset between the pillars.  Towards the east can be seen a large

leads into the castle, while the grassy courtyard extends to the east, 
south, west, southeast and southwest.

    <desc>A large clock is sitting on the stone-work of the eastern wall in this area 
of the courtyard.  Elegant black hands stand out in stark contrast to the 
ivory colour of its face.  Large, brown, water-stains bleed into the wall 
directly below the clock and a large, green-bronze, pendulum swings heavily 
above the eastern exit.  Both the eastern and northern exits are framed by 
imposing white pillars smudged with finger marks.  The lawn here is very 
green, and compliments nicely, the colours in the rose bushes that border 
the northern and eastern walls.  Visible to the west is a large tree and to 
the southwest an ornate sundial.  There are white flagstones leading into 
the castle to the north and east, while the courtyard continues to the 
south, west and southwest.

    <desc>This area of the courtyard is home to sturdy wooden benches.  They are 
situated next to white pillars, on either side of the passageways back into 
the castle, and have high solid backs, so as to prevent sitting too close to 
the pink rose bushes that are blooming along the edge of the courtyard.  The 
roses blend seamlessly with the creeping vines running from behind them, and 
around the pillars marking the eastern and southern exits.  In plain sight 
to the east is an ornate sundial and to the northwest is a large tree.  A 
white flagstone path leads into the castle towards the east and the south, 
while the courtyard continues to the north, west and northwest.

    <desc>The centre of this part of the courtyard is dominated by an immense golden 
sundial resting upon a great slab of circular grey granite.  It sits above 
ground, roughly two-fists high and is as wide as a small giant is tall.  The 
roman numerals engraved around the edge of the dial are time-worn and 
blackened.  There are small weedy flowers growing around the base of the 
granite slab.  The hedge of pink-flowering rose bushes that line the 
southern wall are punctuated by dirty white pillars that stand either side 
of a southern exit.  Visible to the north is a large tree, to the west is a 
pond and to the northwest is a clock face set into a towering wall.  White 
flagstones lead into the castle towards the south and the grassy courtyard 
lays to the north, east, west, northeast and northwest.

Behind it are rose bushes, with pink blooms, bordering the walls.  They 
continue either side of the white pillars marking exits to the west and the 
south.  The pond is made of small stone boulders, which grow even smaller in 
size as they mix in with the grass.  Towards the north, sitting high on a 
wall, is the Hogwarts crest, to the east is a sundial and to the northeast 
is a large tree.  White flagstone leads into the castle, past white pillars,

    <desc>This dreary, low-hung corridor is lit up by a large portrait on the north 
wall.  It reaches from almost the floor to the ceiling and is wide enough to 
show a life-size witch and wizard smiling happily under an archway covered 
in blue flowers.  The floor is patterned from east to west by a mosaic of 
overlapping squares in muted tones of creams, yellows and bordered at the 
east end by black.  On the southern wall, opposite the painting is an exit 
leading to a courtyard.  Either side of this doorway are three windows, each 
only just large enough to climb through.  Stationed between each window is a 
crude torch.  There is an exit to the south and the corridor stretches to 
the east and west.

    <desc>Composed of limestone, this passageway is lighted by torches set in brackets 
along the walls.  Varying muggle artifacts are featured in display boxes.  
In one display box a Muggle pen and pencil set are displayed with a sign 
underneath it.  In another display, a gun is presented with a silver plaque 
explaining its purpose.  Aside from the various displays along the walls, a 
television sits in the centre of the room.  The television is described with 
gilted lettering.  Next to it is a Muggle photograph demonstrating the 
differences between Muggle photography and Wizard photography.  To the south 
is a continually revolving door, while to the west is an archway covered in 
blue flowers.

    <desc>Along the western wall large, pane glass windows look out upon the courtyard 
beyond.  The ceiling, walls, and floor consist of pink brick in a 
Herringbone pattern.  The eastern wall holds three tapestries weaved in rich 
colours of reds, blues, and purples.  The first tapestry depicts a witch 
being hanged from a scaffold while a mob of people scream at her.  The 
second tapestry portrays men carrying the lifeless witch to a cemetery, 
laying her down, then walking away.  The third tapestry shows the witch 
rising with great mirth, hopping onto her broom, and flying away.  Beneath 
the tapestries a golden plaque explains the illustrations in detail. A 
scarlet door to the east leads to Gryffindor Tower.  Westward is a round top 
archway that leads to the courtyard.  A box archway leads one north.  A 
constantly revolving door leads to the south.

      <desc>&quot;In 1563, the Muggles passed the Witchcraft Bill under their leader, Queen 
Elizabeth I.  The first witch to be 'punished' was Agnes Waterhouse.  As 
depicted here, she was hanged for being a witch and the Muggles assumed that 
they had killed her.  They were unaware of Waterhouse performing a Dysmorta 
Spell, causing her to appear to be dead.  After the spell wore off, she 
simply retrieved her broom and flew away laughing.&quot;

    <desc>The square, flat ceiling in this junction has four great score marks along 
it's length, running from east to west.  These marks have divided the stones 
into section and each section is a different shade of grey stone, ranging 
from almost black to a bright pearly-grey colour.  The stones of the floor 
have been arranged in seven concentric circles of alternating blues and 
browns.  These colours are reflected in the robes of the wizard in a 
painting on the east wall.  The painting almost completely obscures the wall 
and shows a wizard running in circles, being chased by a bowtruckle.  On 
either side of the painting are two free-standing candelabras.  The exits 
lay to the north and west.

the clock is patterned with Saturn's seal directly onto the stones and the 
numbers are bronze, and have been placed close to the outer bronze-ring.  
The hands are iron and have minor decoration at the tips.  Covering the 
floor is an L-shaped runner, from the west to the north.  The runner is dark 
blue and quite plain.  The south wall is dominated a large, rectangular 
alcove, in which rests a shallow pewter basin.  Inside the basin the orange 
flames burn brightly.  Above the alcove is the head of a Hippogriff carved 
in the same stone as the walls.  The only visible exits are to the north and 
to the west.

    <desc>This corridor is resplendent in the vivid tapestries that line the walls.  
In the narrow gaps between the tapestries on one wall are cramped little 
windows, only just wide enough to be windows and not just merely gaps 
between the stones.  The tapestries themselves are crudely detailed 
portrayals of various Quidditch matches through the ages.  There are no 
dates or any otherwise distinguishing marks that may give any clue as to 
when these matches took place.  The floor of this corridor is uneven with 
protruding stones and the occasional shallow-dip where one has gone missing. 
 Growing along the edge of the wall, along the floor and in amongst the 
jutting stones and tiny crevices, are small, plump weeds.  Numbering less 
than ten, but more than five, around half of them are in bloom with delicate 
pink flowers, contrasting with their deep green stems and leaves.  The 
hallway extends to the north and to the east.

    <desc>Along the top of this corridor, growing over the rounded faces of the tawny 
stones, are long hair-like tendrils of deep sea-green moss.  They are draped 
over the protruding walls like airy curtains.  Extruding out from the moss 
are greening, wooden candlesticks, secured to the wall by heavy iron 
brackets.  The darker stones of the ceiling and floor are pitted and 
pock-marked from years of abuse.  Along the lower halves of the walls, out 
of reach from the plant-life, are pillars of stone about the height of two 
quaffles stacked on top of one another.  The pillars are made from sandstone 
and are very smooth.  They are spaced equally apart along both walls of this 
passage.  There are exits to the north and to the south.

    <desc>One part of this hallway swerves inward, yielding to the form of a tower at 
the West end of the castle.  The ground here comprises hundreds of clean, 
smooth cobbles arranged in artistic tiling patterns.  A few of the stray 
pebbles have been sweeped to one side, leaving behind small holes in the 
floor.  The door in the curved Western wall is made of a thin, flexible 
wood, which is plying apart in places.  To the South, torches line the walls 
above eye-level, although the path leading to the Western tower is lit only 
by a lantern emitting a blue ambient light.

    <desc>The office is very lustrously lit by four torches that line the tops of the 
east and west walls.  The merry firelight casts a warm glow over a very 
magnificent room.  The floor is made of a caramel coloured wood and is 
polished to shine, but a deep gold and red oriental rug covers most of the 
area.  A large desk and two plush armchairs swathe the eastern quarter of 
the room.  The walls are made of the same caramel coloured wood as the 
floor.  Shelves upon shelves of books and various Arithmancy items line the 
walls, and portraits of Arithmancy legends hang atop the shelves.  There are 
two exits, one to the south and one to the west.

      <desc>The shelves are made of a dark cherry wood, and are about 9' tall.  The top 
most shelf is full of Arithmancy items such as an abacus that's balls are 
constantly moving, and a compass that not only makes the circles, it gives 
you the circumference, diameter, and radius.  The lower shelves are packed 
with books, all of which have names like &quot;Playing with Polynomials&quot; and 
&quot;Delving Into Degrees&quot;.

    <desc>An oriental rug in various shades of gold and red lie in the center of the 
room. Atop the rug is an intricate oak, four poster bed with the curtains 
pulled back. A worn, squashy quilt lies on the matress, looking warm and 
inviting. A fireplace against one of the walls crackles softly, its light 
casting a warm glow and creating a warm soothing aura in the room. An old 
trunk lies at the foot of the bed, locked.

    <desc>This room is very dark.  The ceiling above is covered with clouds, and a 
dark grey mist.  Suddenly, a great surge of lightning forms from a cloud 
above, and makes instant contact with a metal rod located on the hard, stone 
floor.  The metal rod magically transfers the lightning to a light bulb that 
is connected to it.  That magic light bulb gives life and light to an 
adjacent light bulb, and so on across the entire room.  The lit room now 
reveals various pieces of artwork about weather.  Every few minutes, the 
light source fades, and the room fades to pitch black.  The energy from the 
clouds sends shivers throughout the room, as another lightning bolt strikes, 
forcing more light into the area.  In the centre of the room is a relatively 
small glass cage.  Exits are to the east, south, and west.

      <desc>Inside this glass display is a cloud that fills up most of the box.  It is 
solid and pure white, then suddenly transforms into a stormy rain cloud, and 
produces gushes of rain.  It then gives out lightning, and you can hear the 
faint sound of its thunder.  Suddenly, the cloud goes back to solid, pure 
white, and starts over again.

area.

    <desc>A crack in the ceiling above allows a sliver of light from the floor above 
to shine through. The tiny crack is the only source of light in the large, 
dusty hallway. The light dimly reveals the outlines of several rusty old 
suits of armour stationed on the east wall of the room as well as a few 
creaky old doors. The floor of the hall is smooth and bare except for a thin 
layer of settled dust. The walls surrounding the hall are just barely 
visible by the light, but the openings to corridors on the north, south and 
west are seen as only cavernous dark gaps in the wall.

      <desc>In the dim light, the suit of armour could pass for a living soldier. It is 
arranged with one hand on its hip and the other on the hilt of its sword, 
like a knight ready to do battle. In the dim light, the growing spots of 
rust are barely visible.

    <desc>. Flowing along both walls are stretched, pinched windows running parallel to 
the floor.  The glass in the windows is olive green and full of tiny, 
trapped bubbles.  The hall runner, made of heavy material in the same shade 
as the glass, is full of dust.  The silver thread sewn into the runner along 
the border still sparkles though its age is obvious.  A spattering of 
paintings hang along both walls.  None of them are placed at the same height 
and all of them are showing a great variety of wizards in various stages of 
Wizard Chess.  The high ceiling gives the corridor an imposing air.  This is 
not made better by the stately candelabras protruding from the walls far 
above head height.  The hallway extends to the north and south and a passage 
begins running east.

eastern end has been propped open with a small black cauldron, while a 
broomstick decorated with silver and green ribbon is resting against the 
north doorway.  On the south wall is a vase filled with frost covered 
poppies.  The vase is standing on a small table that has been painted pale 
blue to match the walls.  It provides the illusion that the vase is 
suspended in mid air by the wind blowing through the corridor.  Above the 
vase is a silver candelabrum, whose magic, black taper candles, have been 
snuffed by the weather repeatedly.  East and west is an extention of the 
corridor.

    <desc>A faint ticking noise vibrates through the crisp, dry air of the hallway 
rhythmically. A single stately grandfather clock constructed from smooth 
mahogany stands alone on the north wall. The face of the clock is fairly 
normal, with twelve golden Roman numerals arranged at even intervals on a 
circle, but the body of the clock holds, instead of the customary pendulum, 
a strange liquid material much like that of a pensieve. A layer of glass 
holds the silvery liquid inside the clock and the liquid shifts itself 
constantly, forming vague images from the past. Looking into the chamber 
containing the mercurial material is like looking into a crystal ball. There 
are no clearly defined lines, only blurry images open to interpretation and 
imagination.

    <desc>A long dark rug extends down the length of the corridor, covering the stone 
floor. Both walls are not the customary shade of dark gray. Sprawling, 
magnificent murals in brilliant colors of magical paint have been painted on 
both the north and south walls. A large but plain chandelier hangs from the 
ceiling and a wide window high on the east wall illuminate the breathtaking 
murals. The drawings depict almost every aspect of student life at Hogwarts, 
set in motion through the properties of magical paint. A young, red-haired 
witch struggles to contain the green potion overflowing from her cauldron; 
several happily chatting Ravenclaws eat lunch in the Great Hall; and there 
is even a live quidditch game between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff taking place 
on the south wall.

    <desc>Although the gray stone walls are plain and unadorned, they are in no way 
ordinary. Occasionally, strange shadows flicker across the walls, even when 
the hallway is empty. The mysterious shadows are stealthy and diverse. 
Sometimes they resemble a squat man with a wide-brimmed hat. Other times the 
show a slender young witch carrying a tray full of cookies. No one is quite 
sure where the shadows come from or what their purpose is on the wall, but 
their presence has never done anyone harm. Even when students stop to watch 
in amazement, the shadows continue to slide across the plain grey wall, 
oblivious to the living world.

nothing extraoridnary. A large furry rug covers the floor, and a cushioned 
bench stands along the west wall. A portrait hanging above the bench shows a 
wizard bundled in thick furs, braving a ferocious blizzard, holding his 
lighted wand before him. On the east wall hangs a large tapestry showing a 
fierce goblin rebellion and an embroided title at the top reads &quot;The Last 
Stand of Murkak the Mighty&quot;. The hallway is simply as normal as a Hogwarts 
hallway can be.

 The embroidery, a fisted iron hand holding a cross, has long since lost is 
color.  The names have all but disappeared from view and appear to have been 
written in an ancient language.  The light cast by two tall pillar candles 
on either side of the tapestry highlights the intricate design.  The rest of 
the hallway is shrouded in darkness.  A faint shadow of light comes through 
a crack in the east wall where the mortar has crumbled from between the 
light gray stones.  The corridor extends further north and south.

makes a curved, ninety degree turn. Silver candelabras stand at three meter 
intervals along both walls, holding dozens of white candles. When lit, the 
candles emit a soft glow that bathes the hallway in warm, yellow light. A 
lone portrait hangs on the wall. The portrait itself is curved to fit the 
unique shape of the wall, much to the displeasure of its occupant. In fact, 
the rotund witch who occupies the portrait spends much of her time hiding 
behind a bookshelf, complaining that the bent shape of her portrait distorts 
her features. The curved hallway opens to the north and the west.

a bookshelf, hiding from the sight of prying visitors. However, the 
occasional bitter mutter of &quot;ridiculous portrait makes me look fat&quot; offers 
proof of her existence.

    <desc>The high vaulted ceilings of the hallway give it an imposing and stately 
appearance. The series of statues that line both walls are not ordinary 
suits of armor or crude lifeless structures, their smooth gray surfaces are 
expertly carved to make them seem almost lifelike. A striking statue on the 
east wall shows a young wizard struggling to tame a rampant hippogriff, his 
face contorted in strain and concentration. A window mounted high on the 
western wall shows the state of the sky outside, giving the hallway a 
distinctive flexibility in atmosphere. On a bright, sunny day, the hallway 
is majestic and graceful, but on a stormy night, the fires lit by the house 
elves illuminate the figures in an eerily flickering light, giving the 
impression that the statues are alert and watching.

weilds a long slender wand in his right hand but the hippogriffs clawed leg 
has pinned the wand hand to the floor. His left arm is raised protectively 
over his face, pushing the hippogriff's snapping beak away.

hall runner in here is very dark brown threadbare.  There is a faint, 
chocolate brown, hounds tooth pattern on the carpet.  Hovering out of reach 
are many stubby candles.  Down one side of this corridor, carved into the 
floor is a shallow channel, disappearing at either end into a hole in the 
floor.  The hole is just smaller than a galleon.  On the same side as the 
channel is a portrait of a stately looking witch in vermilion robes.  Her 
greying hair is pulled into an immaculate roll and she has a pewter grey owl 
on her shoulder.  The other wall is completely bare.  The corridor extends 
on to the east and west.

    <desc>The wide, straight corridor is lined portraits of former Hogwarts headboys 
and headgirls on the north and south walls. The portraits date from some 
twenty years back when the tradition was started. Most of the paintings are 
of studious young men and women, chewing on the ends of their quills and 
contemplating the theory behind human transfiguration. However, a few social 
exceptions visit each other to play gobstones or toss a quaffle around. 
Percy Weasley's painting hangs among the others, and the freckle-faced 
overachiever dutifully glares at the other portraits, telling them off for 
making too much noise.

scathing looks at the neighboring paintings and shushing them loudly when 
their activities become too rowdy.

with sharp spikes surrounding its edge and a heavy black chain disappearing 
up and into the silk.  The silk is patterned with diamonds barely 
distinguishable against the grey of the material.  Starting thirty 
centimetres from each doorway and one-third of the way up each wall, every 
second stone is also engraved with the outline of a diamond.  To the east is 
a long corridor.  This corridor extend to the north and south.

    <desc>The air in the corridor is unbearably stuffy and damp, weighing heavily 
downward and pressing suffocatingly inward. The hallway is too warm and 
humid to allow suits of armour or portraits, so the bare walls are moist 
with a thin layer of water, and a soft green layer of mold has begun to grow 
on some of the stones. The hallway is windowless and lit by a single 
resilient flame mounted on a torch that continues to burn despite the muggy 
atmosphere. The unpleasant moisture and suppressingly thick air induces a 
stench of mildew and decay and the passage's cramped and narrow space 
magnifies the uncomfortably claustrophobic and restrained atmosphere.

    <desc>A large oak desk sits in the center of the office, littered with papers and 
thick books on different methods of transfiguration. Three squashy armchairs 
sit in the room, one behind the desk and two in front, all resting on top of 
a circular oriental rug in beautiful shades of blue and green. A large, 
empty bird cage sits in the corner beside the window - remnants of different 
kinds of feathers resting in its bottom. Wooden bookcases line one of the 
walls full of thick volumes of spell books and other magical relics. Along 
the opposite wall sits an open, crackling fireplace, the flames within 
dancing across the wood, and providing the room with a faint light and 
warmth. Behind the desk sits a large oak door, partially open, light 
glimmering faintly on the other side.

various feathers from different species of birds strewn across the bottom of 
the cage from past classes. Paintings of past witches and wizards are lined 
against the walls, over-looking the classroom.

    <desc>Hanging just below the ceiling of the hallway is a thin, whispy layer of 
white clouds. Through a break in the cloud barrier, two shimmering orbs are 
visible. Eerily reminiscent of full moons on a cloudy night, the two glowing 
orbs revolve around each other, shedding soft pearly light onto the hallway. 
The smooth stone floor is bare and cool, bordered on the east and west by 
stately, gray walls. The room is empty save for a portrait of an 
absent-minded looking witch in patched blue robes hanging on the west wall. 
The hallway continues to the north and south.

frazzled witch within the painting wears thick, black framed spectacles, her 
face framed by a mop of untame gray hair. She mutters uneasily to herself as 
she mixes potions ingredients in a set of crystal phials, unsure of whether 
or not her next move will cause a violent explosion.

every professional team in Britain and Ireland along with some of the more 
notable Hogwarts players. The Chudley Cannons zoom about their painting in 
bright orange robes, and Oliver Wood waves happily at passing students from 
the Puddlemere United painting. Between the paintings are also models of 
famous brooms. A fake firebolt gleams proudly between the portraits of the 
Wimbourne Wasps and the Ballycastle Bats. On the far wall is also a complete 
list of Quidditch World Cup champions, dating back to 1473.

    <desc>Set into a deep, square alcove, in the middle of the corridor, is the bust 
of a witch with short, curly hair and thick, bleak features.  Overpowering 
this corridor are the tawny stones in the floors, walls and ceilings.  
Contrastingly, the floor has a central row of square, black stones from end 
to end with small gaps between them and the ceiling is identical to the 
floor.  Four-fifths of the ways up both of the walls are great wooden spikes 
driven halfway in.  Below the spikes, on either wall, are blue-paned 
lanterns on hooks supported by spindly lengths of iron.  A passage begins to 
the south.  This passage extends to the east and to the west.

drapes hang not over windows, but over solid stone.  The tears in the thick, 
heavy cloth are restricted to the lower half and vary in size from the very, 
very small to great, long gashes.  The stones used to build this section of 
castle are great hulking blocks.  This entire corridor is blanketed in a 
soft green glow.  The gentle illumination penetrates into every crack and 
crevice.  However, it does not succeed in lighting up the murky portrait 
opposite the drapes.  This foul-faced resident is a thin-lipped, brute of a 
wizard bearing down on the room.  The corridor extends to the east and west.

any distinguishing features. At the center of the room stands its only 
object of interest. A giant sundial, three meters across stands mounted on a 
thick marble pedestal directly in the center of the hallway. A window along 
the south wall allows sunlight to filter into the room during the daytime, 
illuminating the shadow casting protrusion on the face of the sundial. At 
night, the house elves light the torches mounted on both walls, filling the 
hallway with a soft flickering light and rendering the magnificent sundial 
useless.

    <desc>.  Covered in creeping moss, the white stone walls of this short corridor seem 
to gleam with an irridescent shine. A sliver of light pools on the ground, 
rising up the leg of an ancient chair to cast a soft glow on the elaborately 
carved design etched into the wooden frame of the chair. Glittering suits of 
armour line the walls, each with a feathered plume protruding from the tips 
of their bejeweled helmets and a flowing ribbon billowing from their 
polished armour. To the east and west, the hallways of Hogwarts continue.

    <desc>A handsome fireplace occupies one side of this airy corridor.  The tiles on 
the hearth vary in shades from the deepest olive and warmest browns, to a 
buttery cream colour.  There is a plant painted on some of the 
tiles.  Above the fireplace hangs a large painting of the 
interior of a greenhouse and a very tall wizard standing in the foreground.  
The double doors that mark the main entrances to this hall are made mostly 
of large glass panels, reinforced with solid beech frames.  Through the 
exits to the east and west of here, the other corridors can be seen 
disappearing into the distance, adding to the open atmosphere.

    <desc>Cold, roughly cut, white marble takes a straight path down the long hallway. 
 Stark white walls serve as a backdrop for a variety of medallions.  The 
medals are suspended from the wall on large silver and gold nails.  The 
ribbons holding each medal in place are striped in the colors of the four 
houses.  One large medal, hanging from a blue and silver gossamer ribbon, 
catches the eye.  It is inscribed with the words &quot;For Unprecedented Academic 
Achievement: Ravenclaw House of 1010.&quot;  House crests adorn the walls between 
the hanging accolades.  Gryffindor and Hufflepuff hang on the north and 
Slytherin and Ravenclaw on the south.  A large banner striped with red, 
green, blue, and yellow covers the ceiling.

    <desc>Spanning the length of this corridor, set into one wall, is an immense atlas 
of the world.  It is highly detailed with the illustrated tides ebbing and 
rising gently against the borders of brightly coloured continents.  At the 
very bottom of the parchment, somewhere quite near the centre and being 
constantly re-written in swirly script by an animated quill is, &quot;A Gift for 
the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from the Proud Establishment 
of Flourish &amp; Blotts&quot;.  The opposite wall is empty, its slate-grey stones 
indifferent to the massive artwork.  Floating serenely about a half a metre 
from the ceiling are six very plain glass lanterns.  The passage extends to 
the east and to the west.

on various wars and revolutions between various civilizations sit atop the 
desk, each covered with a thick layer of dust. Shelf upon shelf of thick 
books line themselves along one of the walls, cobwebs reaching happily 
between the spaces.  Along the opposite wall, a fireplace sits dark and 
cold, the remnants of a fire resting in the hearth, webs stretching in the 
corners. A large wooden door lurks in the back of the room, partially open.

sealed shut, and cobwebs connecting themselves from the trunk to the foot of 
the bed. Ancient paintings of revolutions and wars of various civilizations 
are lined neatly across the walls.  A fireplace rests against one of the

    <desc>The golden walls, floor, and ceiling of this corridor radiate a honeyed 
sheen.  Torches are set into golden brackets shaped like pyramids.  
Distributed throughout the room are dazzling sapphire-blue scarabs.  Notes 
of music are distributed throughout the room, though there doesn't seem to 
be a place of origin for this tune.  The tempo comes from a piano striking 
its keys to sound like a childhood lullaby or waltz: slow, wistful, yet 
joyful.  The scarabs, though set into the walls, floor, and ceiling, are 
moving in unison with the music.  They seem to almost be dancing, spinning.  
To the west is an hour glass-shaped portal, while a box arch leads to the 
east.  A golden-coloured metal door leads south.

impending darkness.  One player, dressed in orange, nearly misses running 
into the stands of cheering fans in the falling shadows.  The quickly moving 
fliers zoom around at hypnotizing speeds, making it almost impossible to 
tear the eyes away.  East the hallway extends onward, while to the west the

    <desc>The hallway is completely cluttered with too many decorations of every type 
imaginable. A stuffed owl stands on a pedastal on the west wall of the 
corridor, its wings held stiffly away from its body, as if it were frozen in 
flight. A giant tapestry depicting the invention of the cleaning charm hangs 
on the wall behind the owl. Several rugs are spread across the floor 
haphazardly, overlapping in some places and revealing a bare stone floor in 
others. There are so many portraits squeezed over every available space on 
the wall that some hang over the indignant occupants of others. A few suits 
of armour are awkwardly positioned around the hallway, standing in twisted 
positions to avoid various statues and portraits.

source filters through the leaves.  Water rushes along the floor, creating a 
cacophony of sound.  The water sweeps all who enter this chamber over a 
waterfall and into a tranquil pool at its end.  This lagoon has a sandy 
shore with palm trees, creating a balmy oasis.  The exit is north.

    <desc>A delightful meadow rolls out lush, green grass with poppies, daisies, and 
bluebells.  The sun radiates its gentle warmth through the bright, blue sky 
with billowy cotton-like clouds floating blissfully along.  A little grove 
of trees offers one shade.  From this thicket a unicorn emerges.  He's 
young, as he's silver in colour, but he does have his horn.  His hooves are 
golden.  He's extremely amicable and allows equally friendly entities the 
opportunity to pet him.  The oval in the large chestnut tree to the north 
allows one to exit.

The stairwell is brilliant and enchanting.  Blue crystal stars float in the

different, distinct colour of the rainbow and emits a note of music.  The 
stairs lead upward.  The solid crystal door leads south.

marble, have tiny faces sculpted into their balusters.  Some are beautiful, 
others are horrifying.  One face is particularly alluring.  She has stunning 
features, almost life-like.  The exit is to the north and the stairs lead up

of stained glass light the room in varying hues, illuminating the ceiling's 
fresco with two different shades of blue depicting the sky and the water 
below.  A castle sitting on a hill is in the distance.  A large boat is 
being drawn through the water by a white horse, though this is no ordinary 
horse.  It has antlers, wings with crimson and emerald coloured feathers, 
and fire escapes its nostrils.  The craft carries two ladies in 
floor-length, ivory gowns with three men navigating.  An amethyst flag, 
depicting an otter, waves from the mast of the vessel.  Overstuffed blue 
chairs sit throughout the passage.  Two oval portals lead north and south.

Scattered along the walls are platforms at varying heights; they are also 
white.  The flooring is bouncy, allowing any who walk or jump to spring up 
as if on a trampoline.  Bubbles of purple, pink, and orange with green 
stripes float throughout the room.  Two students lugging backpacks skip up 
and pop the orange and green bubbles.  Several other students are playing 
Bulla Ball, in which one team pops the purple bubbles and the other team 
bursts the pink bubbles.  One student hops from the floor onto one of the 
ledges, and then bounces off the ledge popping a purple bubble.  One exit is 
north through the depressed arch.  The oval portal exits one south.

no better than a cave, made of sand and stone.  A small pit dug into the 
center of the passageway contains a fire.  Prehistoric images are painted 
onto the walls and ceiling.  Depictions of birds, bugs, squiggly lines, 
ankhs, animals, humans, clouds, rain, spears, the sun, and the moon comprise 
the hieroglyphics along this hall.  A few large stones allows one to sit 
down, if one so chooses.  Arches in the stone walls lead east, south, or

    <desc>The corridor is glacial, like an icebox, forcing one's breath to appear as 
tiny bits of fog.  The floor, walls, and ceiling are charcoal-grey, grim.  
One lone torch attempts to emit a bit of light, but the darkness seems to 
almost swallow it.  An ebony, marble table sports grey, dingy chairs around 
its circular form.  The room possesses an air of neglect, making it hard to 
determine if the room is shadowy in appearance from its original colour, or 
from the years of inattention.  If one looks closely, the walls model two 
dark tapestries, each weaved in varying colours of blacks and greys.  One 
tapestry depicts Rochester Castle, in Kent, and its famous tenant.  The 
second tapestry portrays Lowther Castle in Westmoreland and its resident, 
the infamous &quot;wicked Jimmy&quot;.  The exits are north, east, and west.

      <desc>&quot;Wicked Jimmy&quot;, or Sir James Lowther, was a ruthless man in an unhappy &quot;arranged&quot; marriage.  He fell in love with a lovely, young woman, who eventually grew ill and died.  He kept her body in his castle for a while, attending to her room everyday, refusing to believe she was dead.  When his servants complained of the smell she was finally buried.  His angst caused him to constantly walk the grounds.  At his death he came back to stroll the grounds once again.

    <desc>Criss-crossing the ceiling of this sweeping corridor are great exposed beams 
made of some dark wood.  Spun around the beams, and drooping down onto the 
torches, are silvery gossamer cobwebs.  The lower half of the walls in this 
corridor look to be made from the same wood as the rafters, while the upper 
halves are made of large, square pieces of pale grey stone.  Separating the 
wood and stone in the walls are brightly coloured pieces of thick glass 
arranged in a dappled, bubbly mosaic.  Half-way along this corridor, sitting 
on an elegant black marble pedestal is the bust of Bridget Wenlock, 
Arithmancer.  Exits can be seen to the east and west.

    <desc>Daunting bronze-plated snakes arch up from the brown stone walls, their 
forked tongues captured in mid-flicker.  The ends of each tongue are curved 
up to form hooks, from which hang shallow basins of fire.  The corridor is 
wide and straight and inclines gently, on either side, towards the centre.  
Lining the upper the walls are cramped air vents.  Barely the width of two 
fingers, and reinforced with rusty iron mesh, the vents open on one side to 
the castle grounds, and on the other, into various rooms and passageways.  
There is nothing covering the beautiful masonry on the floor; the polished 
red granite reflects the lights above.  There are exits to the east and 
west.

    <desc>The floor is comprised of a herringbone pattern of pink and grey granite 
that flows up the wall.  The ceiling is grey granite with a silver 
chandelier hanging from it.  Pink candles placed in the chandelier cast a 
cheery glow.  A massive red-bricked fireplace is set into the northern wall. 
 Above the fireplace is an enormous painting of Ignatia Wildsmith 
(1227-1320).  She was the inventor of Floo Powder, allowing an easier and 
faster way to travel.  Along the opposite wall sit overstuffed leather 
chairs and chestnut end tables.  If one is not wishing to journey via the 
Floo, then the exits are south through the bricked doorway or through the 
brown archway west.

      <desc>Ignatia Wildmith looks at you.  &quot;You see,&quot; she starts, &quot;it's like this.  One day I was at my friend Miranda's, and I said to her, 'Oh, my, I was to be at Daniel's for tea two minutes ago.'  Then it dawned on me, 'Yes, there must be a faster way than my old, uncomfortable broom.'  So, yes, now there is.&quot;

ground upon the low-hanging ceiling.  Upon entering this passage, the person 
is immediately swooped up by a cloud which will glide that person through 
this hall.  The sky is a radiant blue and the sun's rays are warming.  The 
ceiling holds a charming garden.  An array of flowers, such as lilies, 
buttercups, and morning glories, hang in splendor.  In the centre of the 
garden is a fountain of a woman playing a saxophone with water spraying up 
from the bell of her instrument.  The water arches and streams back into its 
tiny pool.  It appears there may be something in the pool.  Southward is an 
inverted V, through the red, circular opening you will head east, and to the 
north is a bricken doorway.

windows, with a decagon pattern etched into them, line the walls, permitting 
the external light to filter in.  Hanging from the ceiling are two glass 
chandeliers with orange candles.  An extravagant rug lies upon the floor.  
The border is burnt orange with lavish greens and blues depicting some 
forgotten man.  However, the rug causes all who step upon it to flip upside 
down, forcing them to walk off of it on their hands.  A decrepit-looking 
archway leads to the south, while an inverted V allows access to the north.

blooming flowers.  The light streams in through four large octagonal windows

    <desc>This corridor is quite warm, the air is very dense and moist.  The floor 
here is covered with mud and leaves with ocassional patches of the old 
marble glimpsing through.  Covering the walls are thick brown vines and 
wide, dark green leaves.  There are recesses in the walls that look like 
they could have been windows but they are so obscured by foliage it is quite 
impossible to tell.  There is a low wooden ceiling hanging with trailing 
vines.  It is hard to distinguish beams from branches and it seems that the 
plants are doing half the work of keeping the ceiling up.  There is a 
circular oak door to the south wreathed in tiny blossoming flowers, the 
words &quot;Herbology Office&quot; carved into it.  The corridor leads away to the 
east and west, opening up as it goes.

    <desc>This corridor is hot and humid like a greenhouse.  The floor is an aged 
marble, slightly soiled and worn.  Moss and dirt are in every seam and 
crack.  The dull stone walls have small shoots sprouting from tiny holes and 
fissures covering their surface.  Four high, recessed windows are set into 
one wall, the view partially obscured by the foliage outside.  The windows 
are made of thick glass covered in a thin layer of greenish grime and look 
as though they have been neglected for decades.  Above, a wooden braced 
ceiling slopes lower towards the east and arches high to the west.  More 
shoots can be seen dangling from the dark beams.

    <desc>The light brown stone of the floor in this corridor is heavily veined with 
spidery white threads.  The walls are of the same light brown, but there are 
no threads running through these stones.  The corridor is split into three 
levels with two steps on each side leading to a centre pit.  Directly facing 
the pit, on one of the walls, is a large arched window.  It has many panes 
of ordinary glass, is as almost wide as the pit itself and it stretches to 
just below the ceiling.  Covering the floor of the pit is a circular, navy 
blue, mat.  At its outer edge are two, thin, white, concentric circles.  
Mirroring this, exactly above the mat, some ways up, are two rings of long 
candles, bobbing gently in mid-air.  Exits are visible to the east and to 
the west.

    <desc>Painted upon one wall, a beautiful, young woman wears a long, green dress 
with a grey cloak.  On the opposite wall a riddled, old hag is attired in a 
similar green dress with grey cloak.  Over the exits, leading west and east, 
identical, horrifying spirits rise, each spirit meeting in the centre of the 
ceiling with their grey cloaks billowing like wings.  Stringy, white hair 
extends straight-out from their scalps, like grotesque haloes; their flesh 
is sagging, wrinkled, and decayed.  Their eyes glow ruby-red and their 
mouths are stretched into a toothless scream.  Red tapered candles float in 
the air casting an eerie pallor to the room.  One lone, spindly, red chair 
sits in a corner.

    <desc>The walls are paneled with a rich, deep cherry wood, as are the floor and 
ceiling.  The sheen upon this wood is so lustrous that one can see his or 
her own reflection.  Centred on the floor is a large triangle.  Lined in 
gold within the triangle are three smaller equilateral triangles with the 
tips of their bases touching.  The illusion of these points touching 
produces an equal triangle, lined in gold, in the centre, creating the one 
large triangle.  Slim, floating, golden candles light this grand passageway. 
 Plush leather chairs are placed along the walls.  On the walls are four 
paintings representing each of the houses' mascots; look to the triangle 
about them.  The exits are through golden triangular openings the north, 
south, and west.

give the room a warm glow while they act out a mesmerizing drama using the 
ceiling as a backdrop.  Shields mounted upon plaques sparkle from the orange 
glow and reminisce in the glory days.  The rough stone floor has a wide rut 
worn in the center of it from the centuries of use.  Lime green moss fills 
in the cracks in the walls and ivy hangs from the large rafter running the 
length of the ceiling.  The large wooden dorr to the north opens to a 
staircase and the stone arches to the east and west open up to more more

    <desc>Leprechauns scurry from frame to frame of their paintings hung around the 
walls of the hallway, making a ruckus.  All of them have bright orange 
beards.  They are outfitted in bright green suits with top hats and have 
wooden pipes hanging from their mouths.  A bright rainbow extrudes inward 
from a window and ends in a large iron pot full of gold.  Two large stone 
archways mark the exits from this corridor to the east and the west.

    <desc>The north and south walls of the hallway slant toward each other narrowing 
the corridor into a cramped, dark passage. There are no windows in this 
hallway. The only source of light issues from the center of the north wall 
of the hall, where a slim black stand supports a fire of blue-green flames. 
The light casts an eerie, unreal glow over the series of small paintings 
that hang on the walls. A sneering wizard in black robes glares down his 
nose at passers by and across from him, a sinister-looking hag cackles over 
a cauldron.

    <desc>Along one side of this ample corridor, about a meter and a half from the 
ground, is a row of pewter coat hooks.  Across from the coat hooks, set 
against pallid masonry, is a great, whopping portrait of an old, wiry wizard 
in a pale green porcelain bath tub.  His long white beard is trailing 
through the water and the pointy orange hat still on his head is sitting at 
a crooked angle.  On the same wall as the painting, stationed at the far 
ends of the passage, are two suits of armour.  Dangling from the ceiling, by 
heavy chains, are eight ordinary, iron lanterns.  Extending to the south and 
west are the exits.

    <desc>There is a faint smell of rosemary in this hallway.  Lit by torches burning 
brightly, the floor is covered in a luscious, thick, carmine rug with a 
sewn, golden motif running along the edge.  The high walls are made of wide, 
stone slabs, inlaid with a number of curious designs.  The high, vaulted 
roof has partially collapsed on itself - the fallen beams suspended by a 
dozen hair-thin strands of magical, glowing thread anchored to the walls.  
There is a short, marble plinth on the eastern wall, holding a bust of a 
hooded wizard.  To the west, through an arched passage, is a set of marble 
stairs leading down.  The corridor continues to the north and south.

    <desc>The drafty, dank corridor is covered completely in drab, grey slate.  There 
are small, rectangle windows near the top of the walls allowing a bit of 
light to filter through.  A few torches are lighted to throw out a morsel of 
light, but they mostly cast shadows.  Other than the torches, the only other 
objects in this passage are various paintings of inventors of minor items.  
One painting is of Sacharissa Tugwood (1874-1966).  Another picture is of 
Bowman Wright (1492-1560).  An arched exit leads east and a wand-shaped 
opening leads north.  The Defense Against the Dark Arts Office is to the 
south.

wall is a bar with a maple base and a copper top.  Copper buckets of flames 
are interspersed throughout the room.  Comical pictures on the walls enliven 
the passage.  One depicts a man with daisies growing out of his nostrils, 
while another shows a boy lighting his flatulencies with his wand.  Comfy 
poufs with short maple tables are scattered all through the room.  A statue 
of a curvaceous woman is at one end, behind the bar.  A statue of big, brute 
of a man holding a stein is at the other end sitting at the bar.  The woman 
has a spigot pointing at the man's stein and fizzy water spews from the 
spout into his tankard.  This hall is a favourite of students to relax and 
drink the cherry-flavoured fizzy water.  The star shaped exit to the south 
will take you to the Astronomy Tower.  The arched exits lead east or west.

    <desc>Clear glass allows one to walk through this hall, but the glass covers blue, 
swirling clouds underneath.  The smooth walls and ceiling are painted a 
gorgeous light blue.  Flowing, white, ribbon-like candles float in the air 
granting the room light.  Light blue chaises litter the room.  Dozens of 
portraits of veela inhabit the corridor.  The passage is alight with 
beauty.  The veela, with their golden-alabaster hair, clear blue eyes, and 
glowing pearlescent skin, dazzle the room with their shimmering auras.  It's 
as if bliss originates in this room.  The only portrait not depicting a 
veela is of one dark-haired, rakishly good-looking man.  He seems 
unimpressed by the veela.  They seem rather peeved that he hasn't 
acknowledged their stunning good looks.  There are two tear-drop shaped 
exits leading west or east.

    <desc>This corridor is tall and narrow with a gently curved ceiling.  The stones 
used to build the ceiling are light brown and flecked with shiny black 
spots.  These stones extend roughly one third of the way down and are 
separated from the dark of the walls by two shiny pipes.  These pipes run 
the length of the corridor, vanishing abruptly at either end, up into snug 
holes.  The floor is covered in a buttery coloured runner, almost as wide as 
the corridor itself.  There is some discolouration of the carpeting in front 
of a plain greenish basin jutting a little way out from the wall.  The basin 
is sitting in a shallow cavity, above which is inscribed in the stone, &quot;AQUA 
PURA&quot;.  Trailing off to the east and west are the exits.

    <desc>A long, black corridor leads you to the room.  The brightness is dizzying 
upon entering.  A duplicate of the Aurora Borealis stretches across all the 
walls.  This dazzling phenomenon illuminates the room in shimmering greens, 
whites, yellows, oranges, reds, and purples.  The colours eddy and wave like 
swirling ribbons blowing in a lazy breeze of whites and greens mixing then 
changing to reds and purples, perpetually rotating and morphing into varying 
colours.  There are several lush sofas scattered about allowing the couples 
in Hogwarts to frequent this room.  The exits are through the long, black 
corridors to the north and west.

    <desc>Cobbled grey limestone lines the floor and walls.  A large peppery-coloured 
chandelier, holding cherry-scented candles, sheds light along the hall.  
Palladian windows follow along the western wall, permitting a view of the 
outside grounds.  A painting stretches the length of the eastern wall.  In 
it a vast castle lies upon lush green grounds.  A stout, good-looking fellow 
sits astride a magnificent horse.  He has a sheathed, golden sword and a 
shield with a crest of a chicken and tulip upon it.  He is gazing upward to 
the tallest tower.  In the opened window stands a lovely woman with 
extremely thick, golden hair.  The man is beseeching her, &quot;Rapunzel, 
Rapunzel, please let down your hair.&quot;  She turns her head and completely 
ignores him.  A tudor archway leads to the north while a black tunnel leads 
south.

    <desc>This hallway glitters gold like a galleon, and is also ominously quiet.  
Even the softest footfall sends a tremendously loud echo down the hallway.  
The skirting boards lining the bottom of the wall are the only visibly worn 
area, with chips in various places.  They are slightly dusty and 
discoloured.  No windows are in this corridor, but small candles are placed 
up and down the pathway, giving off a small shimmer of light.  The only 
object on the ceiling is a spider's web in the corner, which is barely 
visible, and a small spider is on the web.  Down the hall to the left, is a 
rather large and empty picture frame.  There are exits to the north, east, 
and south.

old Headmaster sitting in a chair.  The label on the frame reads &quot;Headmaster 
Craig&quot;.  He has a peculiar evil grin.  On the wall behind him is his most 
prized possession; a small painting of a tater tot.

    <desc>Multiple colorful paintings hang on the wall of the cheerily decorated 
corridor. A window on each wall provides ample lighting during the daylight 
hours, and dutiful house elves light a series of torches each evening. A 
plush, red carpert covers the floor of the hallway, making the environment 
seem more friendly and inviting. The paintings are all placed carefully in 
ornate golden frames and smile happily at passersby. A particularly plump 
witch in scarlet robes smiles rosily at any students she sees, offering 
helpful advice on false doors and trick staircases. On the west wall is a 
portrait of a kindly old lady, flicking her wand to charm her knitting 
needles and yarn into creating a thick, warm scarf.

    <desc>The corridor is comprised of light red stone with torches, held in 
wrought-iron brackets, casting light upon the statues inhabiting the hall.  
On each side of the entrance, at each end of the corridor, sit sculptures of 
winged boars identical to the ones flanking the gates into Hogwarts.  With 
the winged boars, a golden plaque displays a greeting.  A few of these 
statues are of King Arthur, Vishnu, Lug, Bikyara, and Zhu.  East, west, 
north, and south each have gothic archways that lead from this passage.

      <desc>&quot;Welcome to the Boar Corridor.  The boar has been a symbolic icon since great antiquity.  Some equate the boar with spiritual authority, or 'good', as it lives a solitary life in the forest.  The statues exhibited here are examples of the positive role the boar have served varying cultures, as it has served us here at Hogwarts.&quot;

      <desc>One of the titles of King Arthur was the Boar of Cornwell.  The boar becoming associated with Arthur may have a little to do with the tale of his hunting the magical boar, Twrch Trwyth.  However, the boar was a symbol of virility and fierce fighting, which the people found synonymous with Arthur.

    <desc>Seven grilled windows open out to the castle grounds from this corridor. They line one wall and are flanked by bunches of candles. On the opposite wall hangs a brightly coloured tapestry of the school's crest. The tapestry is large and slightly rectangular in shape. Holding it up by its top corners are stone fairies, with vivid pink leadlight wings. They are fluttering sleepily against the wall and grasping the tapestry tightly in their fists. On one side of the tapestry is a painting of a podgy little witch sitting in the middle of a strawberry patch. While on the other side a gentle looking wizard sits reading in a study. There are exits to the north and south.

    <desc>Instead of a window on the north wall of the corridor, a pane of solid ice 
offers a transluscent view of the grounds. The unmelting slate of ice is 
guarded on both sides by polished suits of armour. Their metallic bodies 
gleam magnificently in the faint light that filters through the window. The 
armour catches the sunlight during the day and the moonlight at night, 
reflecting them back into the hallway to make the corridor seem more 
luminous than should be possible.

mounted at an angle on the wall. From the wand's tip issues a constant 
stream of shimmering sparks. The sparks fade to nonexistence just before 
falling to the plain dirt floor. On the opposite wall is a collection of 
paintings and tapestries depicting the inventions of the most famous spells. 
The most notable illustrations include the portrait of an esteemed-looking 
witch inventing a quick-healing charm and a tapestry of Wizard Baruffio with 
a buffalo standing on his chest, halfway through the invention of the 
levitation spell.

    <desc>. The walls of the once splendid hallway are aged and cracking.  The grey 
stones, covered beneath a layer of dust and grime, are losing their shape 
and form.  The tattered remains of a dirty brown rug, saturated with years 
of caked mud, struggles in vain to cover the dirt laden floor.  Suits of 
armour lean precariously against the decaying walls, covered in a fine 
veneer of green mold.  Once colourful and magnificent, banners dangle limply 
from the ceiling, their brilliant hues dulled with the passing of years.  
The hall was once a tribute to the splendor of royal wizarding blood, but 
its decrepit state indicates the lack of respect later generations have had 
for the old aristocracy.  Upon the southern wall a brilliantly, vivid 
painting hangs.  The exits are to the north and the east through the 
decomposing archways.

the north wall a similar mural of a male student unfolds.  At both ends of 
the passage, images of the sun are luminous.  There are several study tables 
with chairs scattered around the room.  The western exit is through the 
gothic archway.  To the east is a mahogany door with a golden S upon it.

looking up into a bright sun.  The sun provides illumination for this end of the passageway.  The girl is still wearing black robes, but has also donned a mortarboard.

There are also seven paintings of him, with each passing year, and his 17-year-old, mortarboard-wearing picture is opposite the original picture of the girl.  Like the girl, he gazes into his sun, which illuminates this end of the corridor.

    <desc>The nooks and crannies along the edge of the floor are peppered with faintly 
luminescent toadstools.  Their light is enough to illuminate the floor and 
the walls, however, the colour in the carpeting remains indiscernible in the 
gloom.  The corridor's top half is lit by many torches and looms large out 
of the dank shadows that saturate its lower region.  The ceiling is arched 
severely and the rafters cast ominous shadows on the grey stone.  A 
decorative band of red cedar is affixed to each wall at the point where the

    <desc>The floor and walls are made of luminescent crystal emitting bright white 
light.  The whole corridor is just short of blinding.  The creepy feeling of 
being watched emanates in this hall.  An observant being would allow their 
eyes to stray upward, to the one thing with colour in this passageway.  An 
enormous brown eye follows any movement in its path.  Bright red veins snake 
out from its iris.  It narrows menacingly at any who linger in its passage.  
The exits are south and west.

    <desc>Greenery mats both the north and south walls with a combination of vines, 
mosses, and herbs.  Multi-coloured flowers resembling the size and shape of 
teacups sprout from the vines on the walls.  Hundreds of fairies site 
perched upon the flowers buzzing noisily amongst one another.  Hanging from 
the ceiling are several large wrought iron chandeliers.  Each holds a dozen 
candles with dancing blue flames.  The stone floor is strewn with flower 
petals giving the corridor a potpourri smell.  The corridor extends west and 
bends to the south east of here.

    <desc>A heady scent lingers heavily in the air, its sweet taste embracing all 
those who pass by.  Light streaks through the corridor from an enchanted 
picture on one wall.  It shows a permanent sunset and bathes everything in a 
hazy yellow glow.  Against another wall stands a tall marble statue of two 
figures: a wizard in long flowing robes and hood embracing a kindly looking 
witch, a slim gold crown resting atop her head and a stone tablet under one 
arm.  An old lute lies at the wizard's feet.  There is a silvered 
inscription running around the statue's base.  Hanging from the ceiling are 
several unused candelabra swinging soundlessly.  Two heart-shaped openings 
lead to the east and west.

    <desc>The floor creaks quietly in this corridor, and the walls are covered with a 
bold moonlight blue colour.  However, late at night, the walls will appear 
to be the deepest shade of black.  The weak light from the lanterns hanging 
from the wall flicker suddenly, giving the hallway a more deep and ominous 
feeling.  Further down to the left is a book shelf that is littered lightly 
with some dust.  It holds numerous very old books, and all four shelves are 
full.  Exits are to the west, east, and south.

      <desc>These books appear to be very aged and roughly used.  The titles are barely visible, but you can make out a few, including &quot;Le guide d'avoir affaire avec un enfant de magicien.&quot;  The language is unrecogniseable, and you deduce that it is French.  Another book describes every Headmaster and Headmistress that Hogwarts has ever had, and is titled &quot;The Hogwarts Heads of Old&quot;.

    <desc>The huge Ravenclaw common room resembles a vast overturned ship.  Buttresses 
and arches criss-cross the high, vaulted ceiling in a web of dark, wooden 
beams.  The floor is made from slabs of worn flagstone, sparsely adorned 
with intricately detailed blue rugs.  The sturdy tables scattered throughout 
the chamber all have runic inscriptions carved or etched in bronze around 
their edges.  Elegant, gothic tracery covers the tops of the lofty sandstone 
archways and beautiful stained-glass windows.  Nestled in the walls are 
numerous small alcoves framed tightly with an ebony archivolt, each 
containing a simple desk and chair.  Every inch of possible reading space is 
spot-lit by gently swaying naphtha lamps.  An astonishingly immense 
bookshelf towers cliff-like against one wall, appearing to hold thousands of 
tomes.  Several ladders stand precariously against its dominating face.  
Ravenclaw regalia adorns the surrounding walls, giving a strong sense of 
unity and focus within the sea of blue and bronze.  A sturdy, oak door leads 
south, to the dormitories while a narrow passageway to the east leads out to 
the castle.

    <desc>The granite floor and walls are moist and soiled.  The room is dank and 
dismal.  Stagnant air generates the stale, dull taste that emanates from the 
walls and floor.  Individual stalls line up single-file against one wall.  
Porcelain sinks reside upon the opposite wall.  One sink seems especially 
grim.  The drab, brown door leads north.

      <desc>The sinks seem as if someone has attempted to keep them clean, but from 
simple disuse they are a bit mucky.  Etched upon the faucet of one sink are 
two tiny snakes.  The sinks are as bleak as the rest of the facilities.

entering, onto a dampened stone floor.  Slimy green ooze trickles from the

whole room is drowned in an opressive darkness.  The narrow stone cavity

rests in the center of the room, with the Hogwarts crest laced into it. A 
desk is located towards the back of the office, a birds perch sitting to the

with two like it directly in front of the desk. A wooden cabinet sits behind 
the desk, where a large stone basin is slightly visible through the crack in 
the door. Portraits of past witches and wizards rest lazily along the walls, 
all watching over the office.

    <desc>Radiant blue skies stretch as far as the eye can see.  The sun shines gently 
and temperately.  Sumptuous, lush, green grass covers the rolling hills and 
meadows.  Wildflowers blanket the verdure with an assortment of posies, 
bluebells, daisies, buttercups, and orchids.  A stream of sparkling blue 
water flows peacefully across the terrain.  At one point the stream splits, 
circumnavigating two large trees, and unites on the other side.  The trees 
are ancient and colossal.  Though their roots originate as two different 
entities, if one were to look at the branches and leaves solely, it would 
appear as one flourishing tree.  The trunks of these trees are entwined, 
wrapping around each other as if in a lover's embrace.  The trees' leaves 
are of the darkest, verdant green.  White and red blossoms blanket the trees 
so densely they appear pink from a distance.  The exit lies to the south.

amongst various volumes of books on the subject. A wooden door sits towards

encrusted with lichen and scattered with curled dead leaves.  The rough 
stone walls bear deep scars and worn in grooves.  Vines run from the ceiling 
and hug the surfaces.  In the centre of the ceiling is a large round hole 
functioning as a kind of chimney.  In the four corners of the room, semi 
circular pools of glowing water provide a dappled pale green underlight.  A 
thin breeze stalks the room creating a chill.  The only exit is west.

serene sky of blue with fluffy white clouds.  A wizard and witch are 
swirling slowly, gently though the sky.  Dark blue sofas are placed 
throughout the room with cherry end tables by their side.  Sienna-coloured 
candles float above the furniture permitting its warm illumination to caress 
all in its path.  White rose petals drift lightly from the clouds on the 
ceiling and, upon landing, they dissolve instantly.  The soft breeze that 
seems to buoy the couple also touches all who enter this hall, causing them 
to feel giddy and smile.  The exits are through the round top arch ways

snow clouds cover the ceiling.  Torches of blue flame line the coarse stone 
walls.  Even though this passage is as warm as any other, the enchanted snow 
does not melt.  This hallway is a popular hangout for students on break, 
shown by the snow angels, snowmen, and snow forts constructed around the 
hall.  Someone has enchanted several snowballs to fly around the room.

    <desc>This corridor reaches enormous heights.  Many candles float far above the 
ground, providing much light to the spacious area.  The floor is tiled with 
white and brown stones, scuffed and dirty from years of being treaded upon.  
Several suits of armour gleam in the candlelight, and antlers are mounted on 
the wall above them.  There is a large, framed picture of a tall, red-haired 
man on the wall between two antlers.  He has a long beard and is wearing 
blue robes.  Honey-coloured sandstone forms the smooth walls, and heavy 
wooden doors stand ajar to the east and west.

    <desc>This hallway is brightly lit by huge white orbs that run down the centre of its wide, light ceiling. Magnificent gilt framed mirrors hang at intervals along both walls, bouncing the light playfully so that every detail is visible. A solitary spider's web hangs dusty in the rays but its resident is nowhere to be seen. This hall serves as a junction, with exits leading north, south and west.

    <desc>Upon entering, one is immediately precariously rocked on a high, swinging, 
rickety bridge connected by cables from this opening to the one on the 
opposite wall.  Looking up one sees the vast sky darkened with storm clouds. 
 Harpies are flying in a vesica piscis pattern above the bridge.  They glare 
at any who enter their domain and take turns breaking ranks from their 
geometric pattern to harass the intruder.  At times, one of their screeches 
rents the air, sending a shuddering chill down one's back.  Looking down, 
over the side of the bridge, everyone sees jagged rocks and a caliginous 
chasm.  The wind whips at the bridge, spanking it from side to side.  The 
bridge leads through the openings in the rock face on the north and south 
sides.

    <desc>The hallway's stone walls are covered with colorful drapes of rich, warm 
colors. Velvety material forms banners that hang down the north and south 
walls, bearing old crests and seals of wizarding knights and nobility. Tall 
suits of armor stand between the banners, as if they were standing guard 
over the entrance to a medieval manor. The largest banner is a flowing 
fabric of deep, velvety red, bearing a large Hogwarts Crest. The serpent, 
lion, badger and eagle on the crest are depicted in brilliant colors with 
lifelike realism and detail. Even the handles fixed on the doors on both 
sides are ornately sculptured creations. A plush red carpet runs down the 
length of the corridor, its edges decorated with gold colored tassles. The 
hallway is immaculately decorated with ample space for walking through and 
admiring the suits of armor and various banners.

animals and colors of the four houses are intricately printed. The 
Gryffindor Lion's teeth and claws gleam realistically in the firelight, 
extending toward the brilliant green Slytherin Serpent; The serpent seems to 
writhe toward the noble Ravenclaw Eagle; and the eagle's sharp, predator 
eyes are fixated on the humble Hufflepuff Badger.

      <desc>The nearest suit of armor is a tall and bulky figure of solid gray metal. 
Its visor is punctuated with a series of slits, beyond which is only 
mysterious darkness. A brilliant scarlet plume extends from the top of its 
helmet, and it holds over its chest, clasped in gloved hands, a long and 
sinisterly sharp sword.

    <desc>The corner hallway has empty, bare stone walls with rough, unsanded edges. A 
single leafy green potted plant sits in the corner. It has broad, deep green 
leaves with intricately spread veins, radiating out in every direction from 
a thick, central stalk. At the top of its stalk is a large blood, red flower 
with dozens of slender petals dangling from the center of the flower like a 
multitude of thin ropes. A small window is situated in the corner wall, 
which provides the lonely plant with some sunlight during the day. The 
barren hall opens to the east and the south.

windows are spaced along the top of the walls with blue tapered candles

luxurious colours and furnishings and two inhabitants sits on the wall.  
Upon the opposite wall is a small portrait of an odious woman staring at the 
painting across from her.  Scarlet settees and plush chairs are scattered 
throughout the room.  Two depressed archways lead west and east.

    <desc>Though not a particularly unusual room, there is one major discrepancy: it 
is one hundred and eighty degrees different than the average chamber.  The 
floor is covered with dark cherry wood, as is the ceiling, but the floor is 
situated upon the ceiling, and the ceiling is situated where the floor 
usually resides.  The walls are covered in green wallpaper with a 
fleur-de-lis print.  On the centre of the upside down floor sits a cherry 
wood table with six chairs.  A golden platter holds eight red apples.  All 
of these items are positioned as though gravity pulls from upside down.  
Scattered along the walls are several upside down chairs and a couple of 
settees covered in emerald-coloured cloth.  A pothos plant hangs in one 
corner with a ficus growing underneath it; the pothos sticks up from the 
ground like the ficus should, whereas the ficus looks like a hanging plant.  
Paintings of magisterial-looking wizards and witches are hung, upside down, 
on the wall.  They are images of some of the past heads of Slytherin House.  
The exits are north and south.

print, however, these &quot;walls&quot; are at the feet of all who enter or where the 
ceiling resides.  On the centre of the floor sits a cherry wood table with 
six chairs.  A golden platter holds eight red apples.  All of these items 
are positioned as though gravity pulls from the western wall.  Scattered 
along the walls are several chairs and a couple of settees covered in 
saffron-coloured cloth.  A pothos plant hangs in one corner with a ficus 
growing underneath it; the pothos sticks out like an arm.  Paintings of 
magisterial-looking wizards and witches are hung on the wall.  They are 
images of some of the past heads of Hufflepuff House.  The exits are north, 
east, and south.

    <desc>. This is a short, wide passage; its polished granite walls bear the marks of 
centuries past.  Many interestingly framed portraits hang, conversing among 
themselves.  They give the passage the cramped feeling of a quidditch event. 
 Covering the floor is a moth-eaten wool rug.  High above, the arched 
ceiling is the home to many birds and bats.  A small staircase spirals 
downward to the north.  West the corridor splits in two, to the north and 
the south, and east it extends onward.

mauve with reddish trim around the thin, tall windows.  The ceiling here was 
once the same mauve as the walls.  Through ages, the paint has cracked, 
revealing the rough, unpolished slate that the paint had been hiding.  To 
the north is a shimmering brass door.  East and west, the warm inviting 
corridor extends further.

appearance.  The walls, which are bare of anything but a solitary window to 
the north, and ceiling are made of gold marble which glitters as the light 
from the dangling chandelier in the centre of the room hits it.  The floor 
is tiled with round, silver stones which seem to constantly radiate light, 
and a tall suit of armour stands to the left of the exit on the west to 
complete the royal brilliance of this corridor.

water.  The cold, unfathomable water is an inky black.  A thin rope bridge 
with decaying wooden planks to walk on sways gently back and forth.  Several 
grimy windows line the wall.  They are quite small and let in very little 
light.  One lone torch, in its bracket, gives off a dim light.  The ceiling 
is lower than most in the castle.  The stone walls here are smooth and dull. 
 Two stone gargoyles flank each door.  They appear to be in deep thought.  
Cracks have formed over the surface of the gargoyles, like veins.  There are 
exits to the south and west.

    <desc>This cathedral style hall's ceiling is supported by massive Corinthian 
columns.  The ceiling towers 15 metres above the floor, making the corridor 
feel spacious and airy.  The walls and ceiling are dazzling white, and the 
light coming through the enormous, round windows reflects off of every 
surface.  Several tall taper candles, stark white, stand on silver 
candelabras placed against the walls.  The floor is the most interesting 
aspect of the hall, though.  It is done entirely in black and white tiles, 
and in the pattern of a labyrinth.  The labyrinth is perfectly square, and 
on either side are tile patterns of zigzagging lines.  There are exits to 
the north and west.

unadorned, hold up the ceiling.  The ceiling shimmers, due to the thousands 
of sapphires encrusted there.  They sparkle and twinkle like stars.  There 
are no windows, but the hall is lit by many glowing, blue orbs that hover 
around the corridor.  The orbs ripple like liquids when touched.  There are

    <desc>Arranged in a way meant to boggle the mind, this corridor is aligned with 
various paintings of optical illusions, slanted portraits of sinister 
witches, and unlit candelabras tilted in every which way.  A depiction of 
chaos theory projects from one of the illustrations, expanding across the 
width of the corridor, then diminishing back into an infinitesimal space.  
The landscape of the floor is crude, as the carpet rises in several areas 
with rough protrusions to give the hallway a menacing appearance.  Imprints 
of groaning faces appear along the walls, each with its own look of despair 
and anxiety.  The transparent ceiling reveals the sky above, which spins 
like a hypnotic wheel, creating a sense of nausea and dizziness.  A warm, 
soothing glow filters through the permeable layer, its source unknown.  
Mesmerising images of nebulas, stars, and planets float across the corridor, 
bouncing off the walls and momentarily settling into a random portrait.  A 
broad, arched exit waits to the west, while a narrow walkway leads east.

pothos plant hangs in one corner with a ficus growing underneath it.  A 
small version of the Hogwarts' Crest hangs upon the walls.  The exits are

The sides of this classroom are lined with stadium-seating desks for lectures. In the centre of the room are many small, round tables used for practical lessons. The professor's desk is in the very rear of the classroom, and behind it sits a large stack of books, presumably used for him to stand on. The room is lit by chandeliers, and there is a large scorch mark on one of the tables. The walls are made of a dark wood, and the floor dons a black rug.

floating in the air onto the sienna-coloured floor.  Splatters of wax hit 
the grand fresco encompassing the walls in this room.  The fresco is of a 
woman walking over a hill, her hair long and her eyes bright.  She's wearing 
golden robes that seem to match the golden rays emanating from her.  Three 
men and one woman, in black robes with two blue stars over their hearts, are 
running from the rays radiating from the woman.  Gold-coloured sofas and 
coffee tables are scattered throughout the room.  The exits are through the 
archways leading north and south.

      <desc>The woman's rays are powerful, even affecting all who enter this domain. To those who are courageous and virtuous, her rays seem to have regenerative powers. To those who enter who are not, or straddle the fence between both worlds, her rays seem to grip the heart and squeeze it unmercifully.

    <desc>Upon entry of the corridor, an inviting scent sneaks its way across the 
room.  The tantilizing smell is generated from the far end of the 
passageway.  And permeates throughout the hall.  Incandescent brooms line 
either side of the walkway, delicately levitating in the air, inches from 
the wall.  Trifling magical bugs scurry over the wooden floor, occasionally 
bursting from the vibrant light of a nearby broomstick, and summarily 
reforming upon the surface of the ground.  The steady movement of the 
corridor's objects present the fraudulent appearance of a mobile room, as 
the repetitive motion can be nauseating and discomforting.  The pleasant 
aroma is easily offset by the infrequent, yet awkward, explosions caused by 
the anxious insects.  Wide openings to the north, south, and west signify 
exits from the passageway.

    <desc>Carved along the tall, thin, polished oak walls are hundreds of faces, each 
of them different.  Occasionally one of the faces will make a stab at 
conversation, but the others immediately silence it.  This makes the 
corridor eerily silent, then deafeningly noisy.  The ceiling is made of 
blue-green glass.  Candles hovering mid-air cast ghostly shadows as their 
light strikes the glass ceiling.  Large, white, marble pillars sit on each 
side of both ends of the corridor marking the exits to the east and south.

    <desc>This long, spacious hallway spreads out in brilliant white marble. Along 
both walls run rows of eloquently carved stone angels carrying crosses, each 
as different and unique as the next. Mini waterfalls cascade down both sides 
of a low, grey wall that runs down the length of the corridor and splits it 
into two narrower corridors of equal width. The doors at the west and east 
ends are made of glass so spotless that there doesn't even appear to be 
anything seperating this passageway from the ones before and after it.

    <name>Prestigious Corridor</name>

    <desc>Seemingly flawless at first glance, this corridor depicts the perfection and 
essence of magic.  Within its parameters exist several portraits of the most 
notorious and powerful wizards ever to walk the great halls of Hogwarts.  
Mounted in a level and successive pattern, each picture portrays eloquent 
depictions of its inhabitant doing various activities: war veteran Marcus 
Shavvy, fully clothed in thick, black robes, accented by a lengthy 15 inch 
wand pointed toward the nearest bystander; musical prodigy Glenda Rougan, 
performing a ballad from her tenth symphony; most notably, however, there 
hangs a spectacular, embossed portrait of Professor Albus Dumbledore, 
outlined in a thick, emerald frame.  Soft, quilted carpet provides easy 
access along the floor, comforting even the most tender feet.  Darting back 
and forth across the width of the corridor, miniscule fireflies provide 
sporadic flashes of light within the dimly lit walkway.  Closer inspection 
confirms small, yet abundant cracks lining the walls on either side, adding 
to the vintage allure of the room.  Grandiose marble archways mark exits to 
the north, east, and west.

      <desc>A waxy, golden frame surrounds this medieval portrayal of a young maiden in her late teens.
She stands in a small, circular room at the top of a tall stone tower.
The room is draped in bright, happy colours, and out of the window you can see rolling hills and pastures in the early light of dawn.
Elizabeth Barton, so states the golden plaque beneath the painting, is dressed in an attractive, elegant dress.
Its long, thick flowing fabrics drape to the ground while the lighter, thin fabrics blow in the breeze created by the window Elizabeth stands at, peering into the distance.
The plaque beneath her also clearly states that she alone saved the local village of Hornton from a rabid pack of Blast-Ended Skrewts.
However, this beautiful, distinguished witch is known to swat at her dress in discomfort, and spit out of the window in distaste.

    <desc>A bright stone hallway is pleasantly lit by large windows near the top of the north wall.  The stones around the windows have been cut in odd shapes, as if they were leftover from the straight, even blocks of the wall. They seem to be holding the windows in place by sheer force of will.  On the flat east wall is a large mural.  A large flowering Hawthorne tree with bright white flowers and tiny green berries reaches out long thin limbs towards the edges.  In the foreground a brook bubbles over turtle shells and rushes around large boulders.  The trunk of the tree is engraved with a large H in a flowery script.  Brightly colored songbirds are nestled in between the thorns on the limbs.  At the end of each of the four largest limbs a gigantic bow has been tied in green, red, blue or yellow.  The smaller limbs branching out off the primary boughs have twelve surnames painted at the ends in silver or gold.  This corrodor comes from the west and leads to the east where another corridor crosses paths.

are covered in red wallpaper with a fleur-de-lis print.  On the centre of 
the floor sits a cherry wood table with six chairs.  A golden platter holds 
eight red apples.  Scattered along the walls are several chairs and a couple 
of settees covered in ruby-coloured cloth.  A pothos plant hangs in one 
corner with a ficus growing underneath it.  Paintings of magisterial-looking 
wizards and witches are hung on the wall.  They are images of some of the 
past heads of Gryffindor House.  The exits are south and west.

    <desc>The ceiling is high.  Roughly eight or nine feet high, but low enough so the 
chandeliers can be seen.  Each chandelier is a different colour and design 
to the others, however, each is equally as grand as the last.  The floor 
space is taken up with different suits of armour and chests, everyone 
showing a different trend in fashion, thus displaying the age of the room 
itself.  There is a sign ahead.  The exit is to the west.

a short description reveals to you &quot;The Room of Hogwarts Gifts is where all 
unwanted and unnecessary gifts are sent to, after the headmaster/headmistress 
has deemed fit that an appropriate period of gratitude time has passed.  
Among famous treasures located here is the statue of Alfred the Extended 
sent to Albus Dumbledore from Durmstrang.&quot;

    <extradesc>
      <desc>The statue is reasonably new and matches with the other suits of armour you 
would find around the Hogwarts castle.  The one difference is the hideous 
length of the suit of armour's limbs and the look of complete and utter pain 
upon the face where the helmet has been peeled back.  A placard at the base 
is visible reading &quot;Alfred the Extended 1802-1895, Hogwarts student who when 
arriving for a years exchange in Durmstrang was mistaken for an enemy, 
stealing school secrets and put to the guard Trolls&quot;

    <desc>The floorboard creaks with anticipation upon entrance of this corridor.  The 
walls slant inwardly, providing a subtle imitation of a narrowed pathway.  
Gleaming lanterns maintain a hovering existence on either side of the 
corridor, running the length of the hall.  At various intervals, the ceiling 
expands and retracts, bringing the adjacent facades to a point, further 
impeding the width of the room.  The newly formed triangular hallway moans 
in agony as its body stretches in an attempt to reform its rectangular 
boundaries once more.  In addition to the obscure shifting sequence, ominous 
whispers are heard echoing against the plethora of magical structures.  
Malevolent snickering fills the passageway.  Patterns of footprints embedded 
in the floor reveal a well-trodden rug, as the impressions mark a crooked 
path toward each exit.  Intricate, black archways denote outlets to the 
north, east and west.

    <desc>A narrow rickety flight of stairs leads up.  The steps of moldy wood appear 
dilapidated, as if they are not capable of holding much weight.  A handrail 
of rusting metal affords a trace of safety, but the whole staircase seems to 
have come into existence as an afterthought.  Mold has germinated along the 
grey walls; and if one looks carefully, it forms the letters: B-E 
C-A-R-E-F-U-L.  The exits are up or east.

    <desc>This wide, spacious chamber has a mosaic floor depicting the Hogwarts crest 
in vivid colours and lustrous metal tiles.  The walls are huge stone 
edifices, imposing yet elegant.  Set high in the stone are several small 
alcoves with small wicked stone faces looking down from them.  Adorning the 
walls are several iron torch holders, some holding burning torches, some 
empty.  The roof is a mass of dark oak beams and rafters.  Hanging from the 
centre is a giant black candelabra, its many candles casting an irregular 
light upon every surface.  To the east is a massive black marble archway 
with the legend &quot;HALL OF SEASONS&quot; carved in an arc above it.  A corridor 
leads away to the north and a beautiful marble stairway lays to the south.

    <desc>.  Bright rays of sunlight, coming from a sky as blue as the purest sapphire, 
immediately light up this passageway upon entrance. Occasionally a storm 
cloud moves in to drench unfortunate passers by with rain, but this lively 
corridor remains otherwise warm and sunny. The floor is covered in bright 
green blades of grass, from which buds of purple and white flowers dare to 
poke through. The cheerful chirping of birds creates a light-hearted mood, 
as does the soft nickering of the baby unicorn illustrated by the painting 
hung on the east wall. Across the portrait, a banner reading &quot;Spring Hall&quot; 
in pink, loopy script hangs suspended on two cherub-shaped hooks. This 
corridor continues on to the north and south.

penetrated only by the low buzz of dragonflies and other insects combined 
with the faint lapping of water which is coming from somewhere off in the 
distance. Lush grass spreads thickly across the floor, and the ceiling above 
depicts a blue, cloudless sky. A long tapestry portraying a group of 
children playing on a sandy beach extends from one end of the north wall to 
the other. On the wall opposite of the finely woven rug are the words 
&quot;Summer Hall&quot;, written in bright red, block letters.

    <desc>.  A light breeze wafts down the length of this cheerful corridor, blowing 
about handfuls of pale pink, deep red, and rusty orange leaves. The leaves 
land gracefully on the soft, dirt-covered ground; however, moments later, a 
gust of wind once again lifts them into colourful whirlwinds. The ceiling 
looks like the sky on a warm autumn afternoon - deep blue, with snowy white 
clouds drifting lazily in the air. Two paintings are arranged side by side 
on the west wall. The first is of a toddler charming a leaf to spin around 
his head, while the other depicts a snidget sleeping in a hole in the trunk 
of a large oak tree. Spread out upon the west wall are the words &quot;Autumn 
Hall&quot;, painted in bronze letters.

    <desc>Soft white flakes drift gently to the ground of this passageway, covering it 
in a thick layer of snow.  Above the snow-covered ground is a bright blue 
sky, free of clouds.  Icicles dangle from the alcoves above the two round 
windows on the west wall, and the faint ringing of bells can be detected 
somewhere in the distance.  On the wall opposite of the windows hangs a 
portrait of two children sledding down a steep hill.  Their squeals of 
delight echo along the hallway, giving it a fun and playful atmosphere.  
Above the painting, the words &quot;Winter Hallway&quot; are spread out in pale blue 
and silver.  A single door lies to the north.

    <desc>Stagnant water drips down from rusted pipes along the ceiling.  A strange 
musty odor permeates the entire way.  Muddy pools of water occupy the 
cobblestone floor, some shallow, some depths unsure.  Reflecting off the 
pools are sparse streaks of light that shine through cracks in the ceiling 
and walls.  Light is so dim that it is barely visible from the north exit to 
the south exit.  Snake-like tendrils of vines slither across the walls, 
ceiling, and broken pipes.  The vines encase the entire room, strangling 
each object it comes into contact with.  Splashes of water dripping into the 
still pools echo all around.  Four hanging candelabras, tarnished black with 
disuse, are almost covered by the strangling vines.  An interesting 
pile of logs lay to the right of the floor on the shallow side of a puddle.  
In the centre is a stone ring 1 metre high.

with thick, green leaves growing closer together each minute.  The leaves 
are the size of footballs and rustle constantly.  Rustling sounds grow 
louder and louder each minute while the leaves seem to be stretching 
themselves towards the middle of the hall.  The enchanted ceiling only shows 
grey and gloomy skies, with rolling thunderhead clouds.  Heavy, musty smells 
of rain fill up the hall.  A large clang resounds in the hall and silence 
falls on the room.  Leaves have inched their way back from the exits to the 
east, south, and north.  In the middle lies a long, flashing sword encrusted 
with red rubies.

    <desc>High hedges form the walls of this room.  The dark, green leaves are velvety 
to the touch and bunched so closely together that no sight or sound can get 
through them.  Large, dark, purple pear-shaped fruit hangs from the top to 
bottom of the hedges.  The fruit pulse and throb as if listening to inner 
music.  A sweet, juicy fragrance fills the room inviting all senses to eat.  
Blades of long grass run the length of the floor and are regularly trimmed 
by unseen forces.  Hanging here and there are small clouds of white, 
sparkling mists.  The silence of the room presses in on all sides making its 
presence known.  The ceiling is completely magical, appearing as if the sun 
shines in during the day, and moonlight at night.  The throbbing fruit also 
light up parts of the hedges.  Hedges exit on to the south, and heading 
north is more corridors.

    <desc>The centre of this white-marble corridor is occupied with a tall fountain in 
the shape of a pointed wizard's hat.  It spews out crystal clear water from 
a spout on the pointed top, but there is no basin to catch the water.  
Instead, magical boundaries have been created to keep the water near the 
base of the pure white fountain.  Drains in the tiled floor keep the water 
level from getting too high, and allow the water to cycle through the 
fountain again.  Around the fountain white-marble Ionic columns support the 
ceiling, which towers five metres above the floor.  There are exits to the 
south and west.

    <desc>The corridor is bathed in a deep red light, the torches flaming a dark crimson.  Portraits of vampires line the hall, including several vampires of modern lore, such as Lestat, Louis, and Marius.  One portrait is of Odin Lovago, a Saxon neuntoter, or German vampire.  Also known as the nine-killer, this type of vampire is born after it has lain in the grave for nine days.  Thought to be the vampire who carried the bubonic plague to parts of England during his travels, this once revered scholar was killed as soon as he was suspected.  The only way to kill a neuntoter is to place a lemon in its mouth, which may explain why Odin is constantly wearing a sour expression. Red light spills into four connected hallways from this corridor, one each to the north, east, south, and west.

Several tables line the walls, holding various objects such as vases and statues.  A large painting of a woman practicing her swordfighting hangs on the walls, the clangs and zings of metal on metal filling the hallway.  The candle-light pools across the smooth stone floors, illuminating three large exits.  To the south is a hallway filled with various paintings.  To the north a brightly lit hall spans into the distance, and to the east extends another long hall.

One, a portrait of an old, stooped woman, is chastising the portraits around it for staying away from their portraits too long.  A bag of Fizzing Whizbees sits in the corner lost by its owner.  Through the western exit, you can see a hall lined with tapestries.  Another exit is to the north.

    <desc>Faded tapestries dot the walls, each depicting a scene from the history of 
Hogwarts.  One is maroon, with legions of soldiers marching across.  Another 
is jade with an aged sword held in the left hand of an expert warrior.  The 
gold one holds the picture of a woman with several necklaces around her 
neck; three golden chains hold a Time-Turner, a lycanthrope, and an H.  The 
last, a dark blue tapestry, portrays a tall woman with long, wavy brown 
hair, a thick book held tightly in her right hand.  The floor is polished 
stone, stretching out to the east and west to two tall archways.

    <desc>Warm firelight emanates from the various torches mounted at random intervals 
along the stone walls.  The corridor is neatly kept, minus the few scattered 
pieces of dropped homework that waft down the hall.  A warm, lazy breeze 
smelling of roses and wisteria tickles the torches, making the flames 
flutter but not extinguish.  Portraits of various witches and wizards line 
the hallway, each looking very scholarly.  One wizard is Bartholomew de 
Pasqualigo, an Italian wizard who worked with da Vinci on several of his 
inventions.  He frowms as Sir Cadogan pushes his way into the picture but 
says nothing, instead opting to go back to his book.  Sir Cadogan rushes off 
into another portrait, his armor clanging all the while.  Three exits stem 
from this passage: One is to the south, framed by a large archway.  Another 
is to the east with a simple molding around the edge.  A bird's nest rests 
atop it.  The last is to the West.

Unfortunately, the schoolgirl, who was at the head of the staircase leading outside, fell down the stairs laughing and into a Pampi Venesomna plant.  The combination of the plant's tentacles wrapping around her, spreading its poison, and the plummet down the stairs, left her in a coma for six years.

    <desc>Torchlight reflects off of glimmering, highly polished suits of armor.  The 
corridor walls seem to dance with shadows cast by the armor.  Magnificent 
red flowers bloom out from hollows carved in the walls, emitting an aromatic 
fragrance smelling of both roses and tulips.  Indeed, these flowers must be 
the handiwork of Professor Sprout.  To the north is an arched opening and to 
the south the corridor continues.

    <desc>Huge, beautifully decorated windows that reach from the floor to the ceiling cover the right side of this vast corridor, adding a peaceful beauty of the Hogwarts landscape to the hall that only a painting could depict. Between each enormous window stands a highly polished suit of armour, shining magnificent, flickering designs on the opposite wall, courtesy the large, billowing torches above them. Light from the many torches and candles that spread through the stretch give the hall a faint golden and shimmering hue that seems to radiate a feel of magic. To the left are many smaller, glassless panes that allow students - tired of studying - to casually lean onto and gaze in wonder and serenity.  The corridor feels alive as the chattering of students and books being pawed through escapes the nearby library. The passage continues both north and south, and a large archway lies to the west.

    <desc>A flight of creaking, wooden stairs lead upwards, opening up into vast sky 
above and open room all around.  Below and to the left are the four house 
tables: Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin with the staff table 
directly beneath.  The sky is bewitched to look like the outside sky and 
ever changing depending on what time of day it is.  Haphazardly placed, 
candles float all around.  Lights flicker at night creating a soft glow, and 
sizzle out during the daylight hours.  In the center of the expanse of sky 
is a narrow path of candles zigzagging in and out at different angles 
leading directly from exits placed in the east and west.  Another pathway of 
candles leads to the south exit.  All exits contain dark oak doors with 
large splinters and chunks of wood missing.  Shiny brass knockers sparkle 
from the candlelight.

    <desc>Cobblestones line the floor of the hallway.  Down the center of the path 
they are worn smooth, becoming bumpier with chips and small cracks in them 
towards the edges of the walls.  The walls are hard stone too, imprinted 
with dazzling emerald diamond shaped designs leading in angled directions.  
At first the designs seem to be random but with further study there seems to 
be an intricate pattern of arrows and stars.  The way is airy, as if a cool 
breeze has been flowing all through the corridor.  Six torches hang from 
three posts all directly in the middle of the pathway.  Blue white flames 
flicker from the torches licking upwards towards the ceiling.  Emerald 
diamond shapes of stars reflect the torchlight lighting up the ceiling and 
sparkling like the night sky.  Emerald shaped designs of arrows point out 
the pathway to the north and west.

    <desc>Cool misty breezes flow from unseen sources.  The air is icy upon entering 
this corridor.  Walls of solid, black onyx stone create a feeling of 
endlessness.  Imbedded in the black stone are ice-blue sparkling diamonds 
that wink off and on all around.  Enchanted skylights reflect the piercing 
white light of the full moon.  Along the walls are tiny eight by ten 
pictures of multicolored hippogriffs, feathered owls, and soaring broom 
sticks.  Floors of gigantic puffy white cumulonimbus clouds toss back and 
forth, often piling high on one side and then shifting around to other 
sides.  Clouds feel soft and velvety to the touch, like a huge blanket 
waiting to be wrapped around, and then disappear after a moment.  Stepping 
up on a cloud reveals it is firm.  Light steps taken towards the south and 
east exits causes the clouds to bounce from place to place.

    <desc>Torches of solid gold line the corridor.  Bright flames light up the room 
and reflect and dazzle the entire way.  Every spot of visible space gleams 
and sparkles.  Walls of solid gold melt into floors of solid gold bricks.  
The ceiling arches upwards towards a steeple point, reflecting all light 
being made of solid gold bricks as well.  Light bounces, soars, dances, and 
leaps from spot to spot.  Upon entering, the sweet sensations of honey flow 
forth from the gold, tickling the senses.  True to the understanding that 
gold is ageless, the sweet smell of honey causes renewed vigor and youth, 
almost as if time was flowing backwards.  Pure gold is flexible to the touch 
as is obvious by the many handprints in the walls, floor, and ceiling from 
students passing through.  Names are even scripted in cursive above the 
prints.  Chairs of solid oak with golden seat cushions line the right side 
of the way.  Book stands of solid oak rest next to each chair.  An oak 
settee is placed in the upper left corner of the hall.  A large gold 
cauldron is to the right of the settee.  Golden archways form the north, 
east, and west exits.

      <desc>Upon sitting in the chair the cushion releases a 'whoosh' of air.  It appears at first to be a very firm seat, but upon relaxing further a sensation of sinking deep down into the chair grows each second.  The longer anyone stays in the seat the more the sense of being swallowed up by the chair becomes apparent.

      <desc>The cauldron is large and made out of solid gold.  Anyone reaching in and touching the sides instantly begins to feel mellow as their limbs turn golden.  Gold fingers, become gold hands, which become gold arms until the weight of the limb suddenly drags down to the bottom of the cauldron.  With a 'spluuuut,' limbs are tossed backwards out of the cauldron and across the room.

      <desc>This too is made of solid oak wood and very heavy if picked up.  The joints are extremely loose, creating a squeaky sound any time anyone reclines, or relaxes on it.  While not very comfortable to sleep on, it does obstruct hallways and doors quiet nicely, if managed to be picked up (for it is a solid mass of weight).

    <desc>.  Hanging from the low ceiling in this hall are large, differently shaped 
silver bells. Some are the size of pumpkins while others are the size of 
gourds.  Made of solid silver, they reflect the light allowed in through the 
six windows lining the walls.  The window panes are lined with silver, with 
silver valances and silver curtains that are swept back during the day and 
closed at night.  A strange bottle of a dark, thick liquid is placed 
underneath the curtains next to a decanter of a lighter coloured fluid.  
Solid silver candelabras hang in-between the windows and are only lit at 
night.  The floor is also made of solid sliver and is smooth to the touch.  
This silver passage sparkles and shines, reflecting the surfaces of the 
images around the entire hall.  Underneath the windows are three solid 
silver tables about 1 metre high.  A silver tea set sits atop one table, 
complete with a teapot, saucers, cups, sugar-bowl and creamer-bowl.  On the 
second table is a silver dinner set for eight, with plates, glasses, bowls, 
and a tray.  On the third table is resting a silver set of cutlery 
consisting of knives, forks, and spoons.  Silver draperies line the east and 
west exits.

      <desc>Bell Hall is named for the fact that hanging from the ceiling are large 
different shaped objects all resembling silver bells.  Every so often Peeves 
bounces into this room and the bells sway and clang together.  Sometimes the 
music is a sweet humming sound, sometimes a hideous shrieking sound and 
often just the simple sound of a drumming bell.

      <desc>Touching the tea set immediately causes it to go into action.  The silver 
teacups clatter onto the saucers, while the teapot bends over and begins to 
pour tea into each cup, splashing in its hurry.  The sugar-bowl proceeds to 
dump three lumps of sugar into every cup and the creamer-bowl pours rich 
milk until the tea is a light brown color.

silver tray.  Mountains of fruit, light filling pastries and delightful 
chocolates pile high until food begins to fall off onto each plate and bowl, 
filling them up and falling onto the next one.  The glasses all fill with a 
transparent bubbly liquid that tickles the tongue.

invisible bees.  Suddenly a hundred fairy-sized creatures come leaping out 
of them.  Four fists, tiny needle sharp teeth, with beetle-like wings and a 
body of thick black hair go hurling across the room.  Doxies can be furious 
little creatures that like to bite if disturbed in their niches (long 
curtains and draperies).  Squirting doxycide in the face causes them to 
faint to the floor.

THEN RECOMMENDED DOSE.  Directions: Fill medicine dropper full and 
completely swallow liquid while holding breath.  Repeat two more times.  
Indications: Cures all repercussions from having been bitten by a 
Doxy, including nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, dizziness, swollen limbs,

    <desc>Entering this corridor, a sudden sensation of seclusion is felt by all.  The 
room, plastered with a myriad of oblique colours, exposes passers-by to a 
rush of anxiety and perplexing sadness.  Adding to the depressing nature of 
the hall, a dull luminosity encompasses its space, originating from one, 
small candlestick pressed against the corner.  Floating, inanimate objects 
fill the dense air, supplementing the claustrophobic setting.  Grim, dark 
shadows mimic the movements of psychotic wizards, laughing maniacally from 
within their mounted portraits.  The floor is laced with a crimson red 
carpet that breaks the boundaries of the corridor, lifting itself against 
the walls in a vine-like fashion, while culminating at the centre of the 
room with a series of shifting fabric.  Obscured by the lack of light, 
steady movement of the rug appears to have been caused by an invisible 
force, when in fact, a turnstile embedded under the carpet rotates a 
circular textile in perpetual motion.  To the west, silver curtains hang 
delicately from the exit, while rustic, stone-framed exits lead to the north 
and east.

    <desc>Oscillating waves of light saturate this corridor's spacious walkway.  A few 
delicate moments, and the vibrant glare dissipates with a sudden painful 
shriek.  Once the deafening echo fades away, a broad, ancient room takes the 
place of the previous blinding radiance.  The hall remains illuminated by 
sunlight filtering through immense windows on the north and east sides of 
the corridor, and at night by torches spread along the walls.  Four 
noticable statues of centaurs occupy every corner of the passage, each with 
an eerily depressing expression on its face.  As they detect movement within 
the corridor, the centaurs come to life, moaning in agony and delivering 
crude gestures with their arms, reaching out toward one another in a 
repetitive, monotonous sequence.  Fastened to the tousled carpet beneath 
them, they cannot escape this seemingly perpetual suffering.  A semi-arid 
culture fills the room, then quickly transitions to a crisp chill.  Every 
aspect of the corridor seems to be in constant motion.  Narrow exits, 
overshadowed by the aggressive centaurs, lead to the west and south

unseen source.  High in the trees butterflies flutter about.  Occupying the 
small bushes are tiny magical fairies.  They twinkle like fireflies in the 
dark mist and fly around with the butterflies.  In the far south corner of 
the room is a relatively small pond with frogs, rocks, and lily pads.  The 
fairies play with the lily pads, using them to ride across pond.  Exits are 
to the north, south, and east.

    <desc>A squishy carpet coloured scarlet is covering the floor from corner to 
corner; this is to hide the sound of students sneaking about after bedtime.  
The narrow walls are made of pure mahogany wood, and lining the length of 
the corridor are oval-shaped portraits.  It is said that these portraits are 
the past students of Gryffindor House.  Torches are lit between every other 
portrait.  Further down, there is a faint smell of polish coming from the 
display of the first Gryffindor House Cup award, and next to it is a small 
plaque honoring Godric Gryffindor himself.  A suit of armour is located 
towards the middle of the pathway.  There is also a hint of whispering from 
students.  Exits are to the north and south.

    <desc>This hall is filled with stone figures, animals, and objects.  Each statue 
is part of the hall, sprouting from the floor or suspended from the ceiling 
when not moving.  The statues are grouped together into little scenes.  
Several stone people huddle together in one corner, absorbed in their 
conversation.  Near the centre of the corridor, some granite rabbits and 
other woodland creatures frolic beneath towering stone trees.  A marble hawk 
circles above, its sharp eyes darting to and fro.  While all of this is in 
progress, a small sandstone boy sits in the corner, watching quietly.  A 
limestone table setting resides against the eastern wall, with a sumptuous 
stone feast laid out upon it.  Several stone pockets protrude from the 
walls, each containing a flickering tongue of flame.  There are exits to the 
east and west.

    <desc>This narrow area is covered, from ceiling to floor, with grey slate.  The 
slate is painted with constantly moving pictures.  The mural is of a 
Quidditch match with players flying across the walls, the ceiling, and the 
floor.  Dark iron torches, shaped like scissors pointing upward with their 
blades apart, line the wall.  A continuous flame burns from the tip of each 
blade.  Four mahogany chairs, with long legs and dark leather cushions, face 
four wrought-iron mirrors along the northern wall.  The same type of mirrors 
is along the opposite wall, displaying the back of the chairs.  Before each 
mirror on the northern wall, a thin, mahogany shelf resides.  Long, slender 
bottles holding varying tonics and combs lie upon the shelves.  Long, 
straight razors, with differing fancy handles, also lie upon the shelves.  
The oval exit leads west, while the box archway leads east.

One team wears dark blue and orange robes, while the other team sports robes of emerald green with yellow stars.

    <desc>The entire room is comprised of rose-coloured flagstone.  The flagstone is 
painted with consistently moving butterflies of varying colours.  White 
tapered candles float in the air and burn softly.  Velvety, plush pink 
cushions sit upon four, long-legged, white chairs facing four mirrors.  The 
mirrors line the northern wall, along with four other mirrors hanging on the 
southern wall, perfectly mimicking the original four.  The mirrors are made 
of brightly polished silver with red roses delicately etched into them.  
White shelves sit in front of each mirror on the northern wall.  Upon the 
shelves vividly coloured hair gels, sprays, and perfumes rest comfortably.  
Four white vases atop white stands hold elaborately engraved combs and 
brushes.  The scent of rose petals lingers in the air.  The exits are 
through the oval openings to the east and west.

    <desc>The last rays of light of the day shine through the dirty stained glass.  
Blue, red, and green panes paint the room a rainbow of colours.  The two 
tall stone walls are turned blue, darkening the tops until you can't be sure 
where they end and the ceiling begins.  A few feet off the ground a single 
painting is tinted red, turning the painted yellow daisies a fiery shade of 
orange.  Green covers the floor like a moss carpet, hiding the grooves worn 
in by years of use.  The light from the sunset stretches as far as it can 
along the rest of the corridor, until the light of torches takes over.

    <desc>Flamboyant, colourful tapestries cover the walls of the corridor.  Adorning 
a large sword, with an intricate shield at its side, an immense statue of an 
ancient wizarding warrior sits peacefully, yet ominously, against the 
southern wall.  Just above the commemorative sculpture hangs a bronze, dimly 
lighted candelabrum, with faint words etched at the base.  Scattered across 
the hallway, there are several, smaller, silver candelabras which 
sufficiently illuminate the remainder of the passage.  The floor is an 
extension of the clothed walls, though significantly dulled by the 
footprints of passers-by.  A wide, metallic archway provides an exit to the 
north, directly opposite the rustic statue.  Two smaller exits lead to the 
east and west.

    <desc>Ice blue flames flicker along both sides of this wide passageway.  Although 
they continually burn, turning emerald green at night, they give off no heat 
nor light.  At times, a single flame shoots out towards the high, arched 
ceiling, carrying a galleon along with it.  The coin is deposited on the 
smooth, marble floor, where several piles of gleaming galleons lie.  These 
cannot be touched by passers by, and disappear when a curious hand attempts 
to take one.  This corridor is indeed both curious and magnificent to 
observe and pass through.  To the east is a large archway with some 
inscribed letters above it though they are too faded to make out.

    <desc>The floor, walls, and ceiling are ocean blue, which seems to cause all who 
enter the sensation that they are suffocating.  Blue candles floating next 
to the walls offer some light, but are so exact in colour in contrast to the 
walls, they seem swallowed up.  Hence, they appear like tiny flames hovering 
along the wall where a great ark has been painted.  The ark holds animals, 
two of each, and a man with a condescending look upon his face.  All around 
him people are drowning in the water, and as they call for help he just 
shakes his head and says, &quot;Tsk, tsk.&quot;  The archways to the north and west 
are the exits.

    <desc>This large corridor becomes wider and more luminous as one moves along it.  
On the left side, the torches, which light themselves at nightfall, stand 
quietly and unnoticeably during the mornings.  The floor is lined with red, 
green, blue, and yellow bits of robes, fragments of crumpled parchment, 
bitten ends of pencils, and cat hairs.  This chamber is built with a high 
ceiling and rather empty as a structure, which would either make the silence 
sound strange, or make voices echo very powerfully off the stone walls.  The 
scent of flowers exudes from under the ledges of the great, high windows.  
The ceiling is arched above the occasional pillars placed in symmetric 
positions at the sides of the walls.  There is a classroom to the west of 
this room and another exit to the south.

When the sun shines, the lake shimmers brilliantly and the walls opossite the window shiver with newfound lights. There are cat scratches underneath the window, where cats try to catch the first spring birds.

    <desc>The Hogwarts crest is inlayed with gold into the dark brown, white-veined 
marble floor.  The walls are panelled in deep, rich mahogany.  Lamps light 
the room while Madam Pince's desk sits in the middle.  Her old, walnut desk 
is sturdy and immaculate, yet stark.  In a corner her feather duster rests 
upon a stand.  An unadorned quill and pot of ink sit in the opposite corner. 
 Be careful not to disturb this peevish librarian with her vulture-like 
tendencies, for the consequences will be unpleasant.  Rows upon rows of 
books lie beyond her desk.  Be vigilant; Madam Pince snuffs the lamps at 
eight o'clock p.  M.  Sharp.  The exits are north, east, south, west, 
northeast, and northwest.

    <desc>Immense windows, arching at the top, stretch along one wall allowing a view 
of the lake beyond.  Rich hardwood floors darken the room, but lamps are 
lighted to cast a cheery orange glow.  Oak tables, long and marred from use, 
and chairs rest along the paneled walls.  Beside the tables, narrow rows of 
shelving hold thousands of books.  This area caters to the Year One 
students, the books being simpler than the textbooks contained in the rest 
of the library.  The dusty books are of all sorts of shapes and colours with 
titles like &quot;Hexing as Easy as 1-2-3&quot; and &quot;The Basics for Abecedarians.&quot;  
Most of the primers look as if they haven't been used too much.  Maybe there 
are too many books for beginning wizards?  The exits are north, east, and 
west.

cramming for their exams, though everyone is welcome to use these

lamps cast light upon the sturdy study-tables and chairs.  The books in this 
area seem fairly well-used, though there are still a few dusty tomes.  
Though this area is supplied for the graduating student, allowing them easy 
access to such books as &quot;Managing Magic Masterfully&quot; and &quot;School's Almost 
Over and You've Still Learned Diddly&quot;, anyone is allowed admittance to this 
locale.  The exits are east, south, and southeast.

    <desc>Dark hardwood floors and paneled walls lend an air of prestige to this 
space.  Of course, the thousands of varying volumes inhabiting the numerous 
rows of bookshelves add to the prestige.  Large arched windows display the 
grounds outside.  Smudgy golden lamps light the area exposing heavy-set 
tables and chairs for studying.  Though accessible to anyone, this part of 
the library provides books primarily for those who are studying in Year Two. 
 One tome, &quot;Pranking Powers Professionals Possess&quot;, is falling apart from so 
much use, while another book, &quot;The History of Frog Spawn on Spells&quot;, appears 
as though it has never been opened.  The exits are north, east, and west.

    <desc>This area of the library is restricted from all students unless they have 
obtained a signed permission note from a professor or are an upper class 
student studying Defense Against the Dark Arts.  A blood-red velvet rope 
impedes access.  The mahogany paneled walls and floor continue into the 
Restricted Section, but somehow it is dingier, and definitely grislier, 
here.  There are still multiple rows of grand bookshelves with diverse books 
populating them, yet the books in this portion of the library are quite 
distinctive.  They visually appear macabre and emit a chilling air about 
them.  Though grimy lamps illuminate the area, the books seem to almost absorb 
the light, casting eerie shadows.  There are tomes, slender volumes, tall 
ones, short ones, and some are titled in gold, while others seem to be 
discolored by blood.  The &quot;Flesh Eating Curses&quot; produces a chilling rush of 
air when opened, whereas &quot;Encyclopedia of Toxic Recipes&quot; has a 
greenish-luminosity on its spine.  An indiscernible murmuring emanates from 
the books.  The exit is south.

    <desc>. The hall is brightly lighted by a chandelier holding beeswax candles.  The 
walls are paneled with oak and the floors are covered with a luxurious 
purple carpet.  On the walls are paintings of all the former Hogwarts' 
librarians consisting of such characters as Rupert Smedley, Prissy Wootton, 
Quigley Thacker, Winnie Bloxam, and Alfred Broadbent.  Rumor has it that 
Helga Hufflepuff thought it a shame that librarians are given so little 
recognition in their lifetime, that there ought to a place in Hogwarts that 
paid homage to their dedication to education.  Ironically, their place of 
tribute is this hidden room.  A mirror hangs on the north wall.  The exit is 
southeast, leading back to the library.

    <desc>This is a breath-taking room with spotless-white silk covering the walls and 
sumptuous thick indigo carpeting on the floors.  Silver lanterns bathe the 
room in light.  There are four mirrors in this room.  The first mirror is 
comprised of silver and an eighty-eight is imprinted into the top.  Across 
from it, a second mirror is of plain, dingy wood.  Along the bottom someone 
has carved the word &quot;Occumugglepation.&quot;  The third mirror consists of maple 
with elaborate engravings of male and female figures as well as the word 
&quot;Sexsee&quot;.  The fourth mirror is composed of pewter.  &quot;Gazethos&quot; is etched 
along the top in stately letters.  The exit is south.

      <desc>This first mirror is made from sparkling silver. It is tall and beveled along its sides and bottom.  It sits in a brushed silver floor stand.  Across the top the number eighty-eight is imprinted.  This mirror shows any person who looks into it what she or he will look like at the age of eighty-eight.  Though it does not guarantee the person will reach this age, it allows the viewer a glimpse of their image in old age.

    <desc>In place of lighting and decoration, two large murals adorn the walls.  On the north side sits the round table surrounded by the Arthurian Knights.  Such revered names as Lancelot, Gawaine, Galahad, and Bors can be recognized, as well as many other famous knights.  Arthur enters hand in hand with Guenever, and they take their seats.  Empty chairs play tribute to the many who have fallen in battle fighting for their freedom, and Arthur raises his goblet and murmurs a few words of remembrance in their honor.  On the other side of the hallway Arthur leads his Knights into battle, the sound of the horses hooves echoing and mixing with the metallic clang of blade on blade.  Their armor is already spattered with blood, but they gallop on as fierce as ever.  The light from the murals fully illuminates the hallway, and exits to the west and south are visible through the grandeur.

    <desc>The hall is dark, only a dim glow from two far-spaced torches shed any light 
in this expansive space.  The floors are pure white marble, no trace of any 
other rock in them.  Walls gleam white, paying tribute to the highlight of 
this corridor, a large painting of the White Lady, a woman eternally doomed. 
 Once married to a powerful count, as a widow she murdered her children to 
gain the favor of another man.  When he refused her, she drew his own sword 
against him and stabbed him to death.  In her imprisonment she hanged 
herself, and now haunts the place where she murdered the man who refused 
her.  Two white archways, one to the east and another to the north, lead 
away from this location.

    <desc>Dust swirls into the air as the door opens to this storage closet. Row upon 
row of wooden shelves line themselves against the walls. Brooms and mops and 
buckets are scattered lazily around the area, some with cobwebs lying lazily 
over their surface.

    <desc>Large, golden lanterns brightly light this long hallway.  The floor is 
carpeted and white.  On the cerulean-coloured walls hang hundreds of 
plastic, black-framed portraits, which have been developed in a special 
solution to allow the persons in the picture to move.  Each photograph 
represents a various student or group of students at Hogwarts.  A silver, 
metal piece at the bottom of each frame reveals the names of the persons in 
the photo.  Exits are to the east and west.

      <desc>This particular picture is of four students, out on the grounds, by the 
Lake.  To the far left a seventh-year, dark-haired girl stands smiling as if 
she has a secret.  Her beautiful smile enhances her wildly-intelligent and 
honest eyes.  Next to her is a tall, fifth-year boy, with blond hair and 
blue eyes.  His arm is around her as he gazes at her attentively and smiles. 
 Off to the right side is a small, fourth-year girl, sitting in the 
background.  She appears very demure and her head is bent slightly towards 
the ground, as if to hide her face.  Sitting next to her is a tall and manly 
fifth-year boy, who is cuddling the shy girl.  As soon as the photograph is 
taken, chaos occurs.  The seventh year girl covers her face from the camera 
as she kicks the boy in the shins.  The boy, while growling, then proceeds 
to poke the younger girl in the ribs.  As she runs away, holding hands with 
the other boy, she casts a manner of spells at him.

      <desc>This photo shows a group of three, young girls in the Gryffindor Common 
Room.  They are sitting in a circle on the floor, obviously deep in 
discussion while giggling and laughing with each other.  One girl suddenly 
leans over and pretends to start biting the neck of the youngest in the 
group, while the middle-aged girl throws her head back and laughs 
hysterically.  She only stops laughing when the younger girl escapes the 
clutches of the eldest and starts poking and tickling her.

    <desc>The walls are of a startling aquamarine but seem surprisingly bare.  There 
is a painting on each of the walls.  The north-side wall's canvas contains a 
dark and gloomy graveyard, whilst the southernly painting contains a 
solitary cloud.  Three small, silver plaques adorn each wall.  The plaques, 
on the wall which the graveyard painting sits, list names of great wizarding 
inventors who died in the course of their experiments.  The cloud's plaques 
list the few wizards who successfully created objects and concepts of great 
use to the wizarding world.  Bertie Botts' name is illuminated in 
multicolour on this plaque.

    <desc>This hallway is long and narrow, with plain, white walls. Painted on them in 
black paint are bars of music which change every few hours to accompany the 
song currently resonating within the corridor. The floor appears to consist 
entirely of a giant piano, and the keys continually move up and down to play 
the soothing melody illustrated by the measures on the walls. As each key 
shifts its position, causing for a rather tricky trip down the length of the 
passageway, the corresponding music note hovers faintly near the grey 
ceiling. Next to the north exit stands a tall, magificent stone statue of a 
grand-looking wizard playing a thin flute.

    <desc>The bare floor displays a magnificent smooth swirl of black and white 
stones, arranged in a dizzying spiral. The giant magical pattern rotates 
slowly in one direction, creating a mesmerizing mobile pattern. Grey stone 
walls on either side of the hallway bulge outward to accomodate the circular 
floor pattern, widening the walking space in the centre of the hallway and 
narrowing again at the exits to the east and west. A large, round chandelier 
dangles gracefully from the ceiling. Its candles are spherical globes of 
wax, floating centimetres away from the circular crystals that dangle from 
the golden frame. The light from the chandelier falls flawlessly onto the 
constantly moving floor and the gracefully curved walls.

    <desc>The air in the narrow passageway is choked with a thick layer of light grey 
smoke. Although the atmosphere is clouded and hazy, the magical smoke 
pouring in from cracks in the walls does not irritate passersby. Rather, its 
mysterious nature and pleasantly sharp odour make the corridor an 
interesting and alluring location. The smoke creates a murky atmosphere that 
easily conceals objects and people alike. Light emanates throughout the 
hallway from an undefined and mysterious source, making the hazy mist glow 
eerily. The shadowy outline of exits to the east, west and south are vaguely 
visible.

red. A thick, burgundy rug carpets the floor of the hallway. Flowing from 
the ceiling down the walls are luxuriously plush red tapestries, depicting 
the plights of famous red-haired wizards. One painting, mounted in a red 
frame, depicts one of the Weasley's ancestors, complete with all seventeen 
redheaded children. A crackling red flame dances in a brick red fireplace on 
the south wall while a puffy ruby-red couch stands next to the north wall. 
Standing beneath a window with maroon curtains is a flowering plant with 
giant red blossoms. The hallways extends to the east and west.

    <desc>All sounds in this quaint, cozy corner seem to deaden as they reach it.  The 
thickly carpeted floor muffles the sound of footsteps and the stone walls 
block all sounds from other corridors and rooms in the castle.  The 
portraits hanging on the wall have been quieted by a simple silencing charm. 
 In one painting a slim, studious-looking witch peers through the latest 
issue of Transfiguration Today while a neighboring warlock waves his wand 
listlessly, creating a trail of violet sparks.  Floating white candles 
illuminate the corner, their flames flickering softly and silently.

    <desc>The hallway is filled with a strange and musky scent.  Dust is collected in 
thick layers on the tarnished suits of armour.  The solitary, shabby 
portrait, tucked into the corner, does nothing but stare dismally at its 
surroundings.  The corridor is rarely visited and seldom cleaned; a lone 
torch provides dim lighting that doesn't quite reach the corners of the 
hallway.  The painting of a wizened, old warlock in raggedy robes hangs at a 
skewed angle upon the west wall.  His gloomy, grey eyes peer, through a thin 
layer of grime, at the neglected surroundings, blinking passively and 
emotionlessly as they scan the hallway.  The old man is silent and immobile, 
eerily confining himself to doing nothing but gazing listlessly at the 
corridor.  The exits lie to the east and the south.

    <desc>The floor of this wide passage is liquid-like and malleable, never staying 
fixated in one position.  It rocks violently from side to side, occasionally 
tilting so that the objects in the corridor slide dangerously across the 
smooth floor.  A very chipped and disgruntled looking sculpture of a centaur 
stands precariously on the ground, propelled across the hall by random 
tosses of the floor.  The walls twist and bend as the hallway sways like a 
flimsy wooden bridge in gusts of high wind.  The torches mounted on the wall 
move dangerously and drop glowing embers onto the floor after particularly 
sudden jerks.  Golden railings on both walls allow people to keep their 
balance as they navigate the swaying corridor.  The exits are located to the 
north, east, south, and west.

    <desc>A complete sense of warmth and security floods through the hallway. The 
walls are covered by giant tapestries filled with whimsical designs of 
magnificent colors. A large golden yellow sun decorates one tapestry while a 
large pink heart stretches across another. A charming statue of cupid stands 
on a pedastal on the west wall, smiling aimlessly as it casually places an 
arrow in its bow. A stream of sunlight filters through the room from a 
skylight in the ceiling, even at night. A feeling of complete serenity 
permeates the corridor, from the thick, fluffy rug to the bright, welcoming 
skylight. The hallway smells pleasantly like warm fudge drizzled over 
vanilla ice cream, making all who walk through it feel welcome and at home.

The walls seem to narrow as the hallway progresses, instilling a sense of 
claustrophobia into the easily flustered. Sculptures of emaciated figures 
with gnarled fingers are frozen in their progress out of the walls, their 
clawing fingers reaching toward the centre of the hallway, inching toward 
unsuspecting visitors. A few flickering torches give the statues lining 
either side a lifelike quality, making it seem as if they are not frozen in 
stone, but straining, ever so slowly, toward the living beings that pass 
through the hallway.

shade of sky blue, with puffy white clouds drifting lazily across it.  A 
cascade of flowing navy blue streamers dangle from the enchanted ceiling 
like torrents of smooth and unending rain.  On the walls of the hallway are 
portraits of wizards in blue, including a painting of the latest Puddlemere 
United Quidditch team, seven men and women clothed in matching blue robes 
with crossed bulrushes emblazoned across the chest.  A sculpture of the 
famous opera-singing witch, Carmen, stands at the corner, dressed in a gown 
made of sapphire blue gems, frozen in mid-song.  Other colours gradually 
seep into the hallway from the north and east.

Oriental red tapestries hang upon the walls, each depicting Ma-ku, a 
beneficent goddess/sorceress from Chinese mythology.  She personified 
goodness in all people.  In the first tapestry Ma-ku, in her first avatar, 
is tending to mulberry trees.  In the second tapestry Ma-ku is in a

Ma-ku is picking flowers in an enchanting field.  The exits are through the

    <desc>The world suddenly plunges to darkness.  Sinister shadows of strange shapes 
play in shades of dark red and blue on the walls and the floor.  The room 
smells musky and damp.  There is complete silence here - all noises seem to 
be absorbed into the large rocky tiles on the ground.  Without being 
particularly cold or windy, this passage is strangely bone chilling.  The 
walls are damp and very old, but intact, with no trace of dust inside.  The 
lack of imperfections in this area is disquieting.  The focus of this entire 
chamber seems to be the sculpted dragon with outstretched wings in the 
corner, framed by dangling red curtains.  With no torches to light the way, 
the only source of light is the odd reflections of coloured light from the 
large, sculpted guardian.  It is perhaps because of the size of the 
bas-relief that the ceiling is very high and arched.  There are luminous 
exits to the north and to the east.

      <desc>The curtains dangle strangely even in the absence of any breeze, but their 
rustle is muted.  They are rather long and run alongside the dragon's entire 
height.  They are of a dark, light stealing, ruby red, depicting smaller 
dragons in a crouched position, which could be considered suitable either
for attack or for guarded submission.

      <desc>This dragon is very accurately sculpted with a terrifying amount of detail 
included within.  Its large, reptilian beak is open slightly, revealing two 
rows of very sharp teeth, glittering with a strange light.  The wings of the 
dragon are outstretched and protectively turned inwards, the cut of the 
membranes painfully detailed.  The dragon's talons and red eyes are also 
spreading strange, faded light.

      <desc>The dragon's eyes are fierce, but not angry, and they look directly at the 
passers-by from a considerable height.  They are made of red crystals, which 
give out a faint reddish light, which makes a halo around the dragon's head.

 Its front legs are positioned for attack, one below the others.  The talons

around it.

    <desc>This corridor twinkles and sparkles, due to the thousands of jewels 
encrusted on all surfaces of the corridor.  Each exquisite jewel is a small 
part of an outdoor scene.  On the floor, a carpet of emeralds is the lush 
grass one would only find in the most picturesque fields and gardens.  A 
round sapphire lake occupies the centre of the hall, and each sapphire 
twinkles and glitters in the light of the torches hanging along the walls, 
the lone providers of light.  Coming up in the emerald grass are strands of 
peridots, with garnet, opal, and citrine petals on top, each a shining 
flower.  The walls and ceiling are blue topaz, with diamond clouds drifting 
lazily overhead.  Always bright and cheery, it is like summer all year round 
in this corridor.  There are exits to the east, south, and west.

    <desc>A baleful light illuminates this corridor casting stark shadows.  The source 
is an enchanted ceiling depicting a seething mass of smoke and flame.  A 
floor made of highly polished stone reflects the conflagration above it 
creating the illusion of a burning carpet.  The solid stone walls are 
blackened, thickly lined with ash and soot.  Leaning out from them are 
marble figures of angels, shielding their eyes from the blaze around them.  
The corridor extinguishes to the east and the west.

    <desc>This whole corridor feels ancient and quiet.  It is one of the more unused 
corridors in Hogwarts and has grown very still.  The walls and floor are 
made of intricate golden sandstone with an engraved serpent design running 
through the seams.  The arched roof high above has thick glass windows 
allowing dappled light to stream through the musty air.  On one wall hangs a 
painting of a beautiful sky over a calm ocean.  Dust lines the edges and 
fades the colours.  It is surrounded by an ornate frame, gleaming and new.  
The corridor stretches on to the east and west.

    <desc>Smoke and darkness consume this room as one enters.  The once pure-white 
walls have become scorched black with soot over the years.  Covering the 
ceiling are tiny white stars that twinkle brightly.  In the middle of the 
ceiling is a blackened area, due to char marks from a large flame of fire.  
This magical fire resides near the centre of the room and produces bright 
red sparks when anyone gets too close.  Smaller blazes of fire float and 
roam through the area, combining to create a more powerful flame when they 
crash into each other.  Exits are to the north and west.

    <desc>The very warm and dry passage leads down a long flight of steps, which is 
in-built within the narrow corridor, as if carved inside a rocky box.  The 
torches at the top and at the bottom of the stairs give just about enough 
light for one to glimpse the steps and not slip on them.  In the warm, 
flickering light, the grey stones look nearly red, with a slight smoky tinge 
to make the colour colder and more distant than it should be.  The low 
ceiling is lit awkwardly by alternating shadowy and bright beaming rays.  
The old walls are cracked by heat and dryness.  The steps are worn to the 
point where their edges are rounded.  The dusty silence echoes warmly and 
thickly off the arched ceiling.  There is a painting on the archway.  There 
are exits south and west.

      <desc>The painting depicts a young wizard with wavy golden hair dressed in long blue dress robes and dragon hide boots. He is holding a wand aloft which has just shot out an &quot;Avis!&quot; spell. The white pigeons he has just created are portrayed in full flight around him. The painting is old, however, and while the torchlight adds significantly to the warmth of the wizard's face, one can see that bits from the boots are scattered on the floor, having fallen alongside the wall.

    <desc>A short, narrow corridor links two larger passages.  It is musty and a 
substantial layer of dust coats the floor, as though nobody has passed 
through recently.  The rough stone walls are bare except for a large and 
rather unfurnished gold-framed painting.  A thickset witch is depicted in 
the painting and is wearing violet robes, with her hat pulled down low over 
her forehead.  The artist appears not to have bothered with painting a 
background, so the lonely-looking witch stands in a blank canvas.  Paint has 
been chipped off of the wooden frame by time, and there are fancy 
hippogriffs carved in a pattern around the edge.  Deep cracks separate the 
granite floor slabs, and years of filth have accumulated in these hollows.  
An absence of torches makes the corridor dark and unappealing.  The arched 
ceiling reaches enormous heights, and there are exits to the north, east and 
west.

      <desc>The canvas is bare except for a lonely, squat witch in purple robes and hat.  She has a small, round nose and wide brown eyes.  Her mouth is slightly puckered, as though she has just eaten something sour.  Her lips are the colour of raspberries.  The frame surrounding the lone painting in the corridor is painted a royal gold, but some of the paint has chipped off.  Fancy hippogriffs are carved around the sides in a pattern.  Whoever carved the frame was skilled, for the hippogriffs are perfectly detailed down to the last feather.

    <desc>This corridor was crudely hewn out of stone.  It is a short, narrow tunnel, 
with rough, grey onyx walls, floor, and ceiling.  Several cracks run through 
the walls and ceiling, allowing water to leak through them.  A shallow 
puddle has formed on the floor.  Indents have been cut into the walls, and 
short, stubby candles dwell in them, providing a dim glow.  There are no 
windows, so the candles are the sole providers of light.  On the flatter 
segments of the walls cave paintings have been drawn, in varying shades of 
brown, red, and black.  This short tunnel has exits to the north and east.

    <desc>The thin and worn grey carpet lining this hallway is very old and full 
of dust.  The walls are a deep, dark shade of black.  At alternating levels 
on the wall are tall white candles spreading light.  In between the plethora 
of candles are large, white, square-framed portraits of every past Hogwarts 
Headmaster and Headmistress.  Some are young, some are old, but most bear a 
kind smile.  Exits are to the south and west.

      <desc>The overabundance of portraits is shocking and every one is eager to say 
something.  The faces in the frames will talk a persons ear off, if allowed, 
so it's best to be on your guard.  One particular portrait shows an old 
Headmaster sitting in a chair.  The silver metal piece on the frame reads 
&quot;Headmaster Craig&quot;.  He has a peculiar evil grin.  On the wall behind him is 
his most prized possession.  A small painting of a tater tot.

    <desc>A desperate shout of, &quot;Oh, please, no!  Not him!  No, I'll be different now&quot; 
rents the air causing dust to be shaken from the beige sandstone walls onto 
the matching floor.  The ceiling holds a fresco of ancient Egyptian gods- a 
panel of divinities deciding the fate of the deceased.  Anubis, the 
jackal-headed god of embalming, sits with Thoth, the ibis-headed god of 
wisdom.  These proceedings are overseen by Osiris, the lord of the 
underworld.  He has the heart of the deceased and is weighing it against a 
white feather, a symbol of justice.  A desperate-looking old man, withered 
with hard, calculating eyes, is pleading with Osiris.  On failing the test, 
a fearsome monster, part crocodile, part lion, part hippopotamus, called 
Ammit, devours the man.  A classroom lies to the north, and the exits are 
through the round top archways to the west and east.

    <desc>Golden baubles, left over from the holiday season, dangle from the ceiling. They are somewhat anachronous to the otherwise drab surroundings. A noticeable change can be seen in the colour of the granite floor, from a stained muddle to clear grey. The walls barely span enough width for two students walking in opposite directions to pass one another. Hazy light filters in from the east and west, where the hallway further extends. Two pairs of burnished bronze doves overlook the door to the south, fluttering their wings and cooing softly.

Persian carpets lie on the floor, their colour matching the crimson

of the wall, just below the gold-leaf ceiling.  A still-life is framed 
against the western wall, above a mahogany side table.  A refined crystal 
chandelier hangs from the ceiling, brightening the room.  Several 
gold-framed mirrors hang from the wall, reflecting the light in all

    <desc>This room is rather empty and large, its oak covered walls darkened by old 
age and dust.  A silvery light glows from the ceiling, as if there was a 
window there permanently reflecting moonlight.  There is straw upon the 
floor, and the little wooden things that do furnish the large empty space 
give it the resemblance of a poorly made barn.  Upon the straw the marble 
statues of three people are motionless, but open and smiling.  A woman, her 
robes blue and a matching veil upon her head, a man, dressed as a traveller, 
and a baby between them, are gazing at the passers-by.  Although there are 
no creatures there, a permanent echo travels through the chamber, whispering 
carols.  There are three doors out of the chamber: to the east, to the west 
and to the south.

    <desc>Vision in this spacious corridor is slightly obscured by a cloud of pale 
pink mist that hovers in mid-air. A sickly sweet scent lingers around it, 
strong enough to give those who pass by a strong headache. At first glance, 
the walls and ceiling appear to be made of a soft, carpet-like material. On 
closer inspection, however, they take on the form of carved marble. A shrill 
chirping noise emits from each groove in the walls, causing the hallway to 
resonate, almost to the point of unbearably loudly, with the sound. To the 
west is a dull silver door, upon which a painting of an electric-blue bird 
hangs. More clouds of mist, light green in this case, guard the north and 
south exits.

    <desc>Slits within the ethereal wallpaper allow spots of sunlight to filter into 
the room.  Obsidian shards decorate the floor, jutting out in an improper 
fashion throughout the corridor.  The glossy texture reflects the tinted 
cerulean facades that surround the slender hallway.  The walls, permeable 
and intangible, present a deceptive illusion for passers-by.  Each of the 
four obstructions is transparent, yet manifests an altered image unlike the 
reality which lay beyond its boundary.  Elongated, crystalline bulbs line 
the ceiling in a successive format.  Powered by a magical current, the bulbs 
flash a brilliant emerald hue when activated during the nighttime hours.  A 
poorly sculpted replica of some relatively famous wizard sits neatly against 
the western wall.  The only exit is to east, marked by a stirling, metallic 
frame.

    <desc>Unlike other corridors in the castle, this passage is completely devoid of 
ornamentation.  The walls are made of a roughly hewn stone, a dull gray in 
color.  Footsteps echo dully on the floor, also of stone.  Though discolored 
through centuries of use, the surface retains the same coarse texture as the 
walls.  The hall has a definite slope downwards, with the low ceiling and 
closely spaced walls contributing to the subterranean feel.  The air is 
chilly, but retains some moisture, making the atmosphere uncomfortably 
clammy.  Odd scents jumble together in the frigid air.  The smells seem to 
originate from the western end of the hallway and travel out through the 
east end.

    <desc>This place looks like the inside of a round three-way bell, with its round 
walls, which are slowly drawn together, finally ending in a bolted ceiling.  
The atmosphere is filled with a dusty, ancient scent.  The walls are lined 
with torches, giving out a mystic, romantic sort of light.  The chamber is 
small and would be empty if it were not for the strange fountain placed on 
the east wall.  The three arched doors lead north, south and west.

      <desc>The fountain itself is carved at about 3 foot above the floor and it consists of a large half-circle made of stone filled most of the time with water. The water comes from the mouth of a dragon which rests against the wall just above the basin. When there is nobody within a one foot radius from the basin, the dragon's eyes are closed and there is no flow of water. As soon as someone approaches, the dragon's eyes open, giving out a mystic deep green light and the water resumes its flow from its mouth.

    <desc>The high, arched ceiling of this room is lit by countless very small lights 
in the shapes of tiny stars.  One can see a constellation in the shape of a 
Scorpion beaming amongst other weaker stars in the distant, dark blue 
painted sky.  The last traces of sand dunes give way to small grass, which 
looks blue in the fading starlight.  There are crickets in the grass, 
lingering around the small water holes, singing their quiet songs.  A breeze 
beats lightly against this peaceful location, rustling the grass and making 
the water gurgle slightly.  The air is very fresh and the sand sighs at each 
step.  No footprints remain behind, however, and the sands readjust of their 
own will, giving this place an impression of timelessness and loneliness 
that is inviting and frightening at the same time.  There are exits to the 
north, south and east, where the sands take over from the grass and the 
crickets' song is inaudible.

    <desc>A curving, shell-lined path cuts the way through this sandy corridor.  Dune grass grows along the trail, emerging in random clumps in the sand.  Oyster, clam, and snail shells poke up from under the ground.  The walls are a pale, rough stucco.  Two large, blue-tinted windows brighten the room, their wavy glass distorting the light.  Three blue-flame torches on the opposite wall from the windows lend to the cheery brightness.  They hang in polished bronze brackets.  The path connects the exits to the north and south.

    <desc>This corridor is overwhelmed by the large portrait on the eastern wall.  
This huge painting, in a gilded frame, shows a tall wizard in a green robe.  
He has a curly white beard, and some hair sticks out from under his red cap. 
 He is old, his many years shown in the lines on his face.  The wall on 
which his painting rests is made of smooth sandstone, as are the other walls 
and the floor.  Upon the ceiling are glowing stars and planets, which 
brighten up the room with help from two small windows.  The planets appear 
to be those from our solar system, though somewhat out of order.  This 
corridor has exits to the south, west, and north.

    <desc>Tha-thump.  Tha-thump.  Tha-thump.  The very walls pulse with a deep booming 
beat.  The glistening, wet room surfaces are made from a red, raw, 
flesh-like substance, with unusual nodes sticking out in various places.  
Walking on the flexible, sticky floor causes it to move unnervingly, like a 
waterbed.  A ball of strangely translucent, red flesh is attached to the 
ceiling by a number of muscular tendons; it casts an eerie glow over the 
three-way corridor, which has exits to the east, south, and west.

    <desc>This dark, dusty corridor is a cylindrical tunnel dug from the dark, moist 
earth, barely high enough for a man to stand in.  The walls are perfectly 
round; it is only gravity that allows a differentiation between the roof and 
the floor.  Just enough light escapes into this room from its entrances to 
allow people to see where they need to go, which is unfortunate, since the 
room's surfaces are not smooth and even, but bumpy and even jagged in 
places.  A small pocket has been borrowed out in the wall to the north, but 
the only real exits from this oppressive hole are east and west, both of 
which are three-way intersections.

      <desc>A small tunnel has been burrowed into the wall to the north, and while it 
isn't very deep, it is obscured in part by a small mound of rocks that 
covers most of the entrance.  Behind the rocks, six large eggs lie.  They 
are unbroken, white, and oval in shape, and a clear gooey substance sticks 
them together.  Each egg is about a foot in length, and about a quarter of 
that in diameter.  What manner of creature could possibly come from such a 
thing?

    <desc>This chamber seems divided in two, because of the symmetry along the line 
that runs through the middle of the chamber from north to south.  A 
shimmering, strangely insubstantial door is placed along this separation 
line, parallel to the eastern and western walls.  This door is decorated on 
the inside with intricate models in iron and the occasional silver thread 
runs along the design.  There is a portrait on each side of the door, 
centrally placed within silver frames and symmetrically arranged two thirds 
up the door.  There are two strange Altars on the southern wall, spreading 
light from the orbs illuminating their patrons, a man on the western side 
and a woman on the eastern side.  The woman's altar spreads reddish-black 
light, while the man's spreads a joyful orange-yellow light.  There are 
three exits, to the north, east and west of this room.

      <desc>This woman is far from beautiful, her right side being little more than a corpse's side, while her left is healthy, young and strong. She has ruffled silver hair and is very pale. Her eyes bore at any visitors, while she crouches above the rotten body of a human being, which lies next to a sleeping living child. She is dressed in Nordic attire, with furs at the hem of her robe. She occasionally brings her hands together, then spreads them in a symmetric movement, after which she brings them back together. Underneath the portrait there is a short name, written in runes and then in Roman characters. It spells Hel.

He wears a smile on his lips and there are wrinkles of laughter at the corners of his eyes. He wears a simple black robe and looks at students from a quarter turned to the right position. He keeps rubbing his hands and smiling mischievously. There is another name tag underneath, and it spells in runes and then in Roman characters Loki.

      <desc>Loki's statue is built from reddish wood, in the shape of a burning flame.  
About a foot above the flames there are two upturned hands, fingers resting 
against each other.  The orb that hangs from the fingers is the size of a 
crystal ball and it sheds bright light on the right side of the room.  On 
the upturned hands there are four Dungbombs.  Since the tricks in Loki's 
hands replenish magically, this is where the most troublemakers come in 
their free time.

      <desc>Hel's altar has the shape of a two faced woman, her right side being full and healthy and young - that of a beautiful woman, but her left being that of a wasted corpse. She is tall and stands proud, her hands holding a balance on an orb. The orb sheds red light from its right side and black light from its left - the red is dark and passionate, the black is void. The balance is in perfect equilibrium.

    <desc>This room is circular and full of bright, differently coloured mirrors.  The 
entire wall, except the two exits, reflects the passer-by.  Every mirror 
shows not the image which it sees, but the same person dressed in all kinds 
of varying clothes and with different haircuts.  It is rumoured that this is 
where girls come to figure out their Yule Ball clothing.  A faint, romantic 
orange light from the ceiling bathes the chamber, but the colour is altered 
by the mirrors as they please.  The floor is made of a very smooth surface, 
which reflects most of the orange light that it receives.  There are two 
exits, to the west and to the east.

    <desc>Bright colours smack the eyes of all who enter.  Vivid yellows, reds, blues, 
and greens - their colour so brilliant it illuminates the room.  The ceiling 
is soft and downy, striped with the aforementioned colours.  A tower, of 
sorts, is erected in the middle of the room, but stretches out to encompass 
most of the space.  The tower is made of white marble, with painted 
platforms at varying heights and of painted slides.  A trampoline is to the 
side of each entrance/exit.  One must jump on the trampoline till s/he is 
high enough to hurdle her or himself upon a platform.  Each platform leads 
to a steep slide.  The yellow slide leads to the stairwell to the north, the 
red to the south, the blue to the classroom on the east side, and the green 
to the west.

      <desc>This edifice is comprised of luminous white marble.  It reaches for the ceiling, missing it by a couple of feet.  There are slides everywhere- short ones gliding into longer ones, skinny ones into ample ones.  The various slides begin at the top, and circle the apex like a candy cane.  Platforms are positioned in diverse places to allow access to the sliding apparatuses.  All the platforms and slides are painted vividly with yellow, red, blue, or green colours.  Close to the base of the structure, four steep slides slip to the four exits in the room.

moth-eaten rug covers the otherwise bare floor, which is scuffed and marked

off long ago.  Two enormous windows would allow a decent amount of light in, 
if not for the grime gathering on the panes.  Faded red velvet drapes are 
drawn to the sides of the windows.  Stubby candles flicker in sconces and 
pools of wax have formed beneath them on the floor.  Dust floats in the air,

    <desc>Elegant suits of armor line a brightly lit corridor.  Stone walls appear to 
have been dusted and polished to a shiny silver tone.  Pink marble floors 
are cold and slippery.  Each suit of metal is posed in a battle stance.  
Those on the east are holding out large swords and spears preparing to 
attack, while those of the left are holding up crested shields, ready to 
defend their wall.  Colorful flags of many nations hang above the lifelike 
suits on the eastern wall.  A single banner bearing a red lion in battle and 
a white cross on a blue background hangs on the west wall.  The sounds of 
metal clashing and battle cries hang in the air.  On the ceiling is a mural. 
 Banners are waving off to the far edges, near camps with cauldrons sending 
off the steam of meals being cooked by women clad in worn robes.  In the 
center armored men clash and fall, making way for those behind them to take 
up the fight.  Near the rear of the battle are large piles of stones, ready 
to be placed in catapults aimed at the faraway camps.  The north and south 
doorway of the hall are lined with blood red sandstone on the west and blue 
diorite, the color of defeat, on the east.

hair and astonishing blue eyes, dressed in a red dress.  The dress is set to

pretty young lady, likewise very open looking, who looks very pretty as she 
smiles and curtseys at the passers-by.  She is dressed in deep blue robes 
and wears diamond jewelry, a necklace and matching, long earrings.  She is 
rather tall, but very good looking, with deep brown, melancholic eyes and 
light brown hair.

he matches her only with dificulty in height.  She beams to everyone, a 
glittering crown on her head.  The boy at her side looks very French, 
efforlessly charming, dark hair and a darker complexion, with glittering 
black eyes.  He wears black robes made also of silk and he smiles a half 
smile at the students that go past him.  He seems to want to wink or laugh 
at the girls that come along, but does not dare to, because of the young 
madame Maxime at his side.

    <desc>The torches in this passage give an odd, faint, orange, warm light upon the 
walls, as if the light was reflected somehow off an orange mirror.  There 
are three steps about halfway through the hall and they and the floor are 
covered by the same carpet.  The walls hold four portraits, two on the north 
side and two on the south side.  The passage would allow a maximum of three 
students to walk side by side.  The low ceiling is perfectly straight.  The 
corridor continues east and west.

      <desc>The carpet looks also orange in the strange light, but where the torches give way to darkness, it is tainted by dark and chilling dark blue, which makes the colour turn to purple. The carpet is soft, but sturdy, and the undoubtedly long years of use have not managed to coarsen it to the touch.

The easternmost have the captions Louis the Forgiver on the South side and Hilda the Unholy on the North side. The westernmost are called Cedric Hammerfast on the South side and Lucia the Magnificent on the North Side. Look at each painting in its own turn to examine them more closely.

      <desc>Louis is an elderly wizard, dressed in light blue robes.  He has a high, 
pointed, matching hat, but light brown scaly boots.  His face is certainly 
peaceful and kind and there is always a small smile playing on his lips.  If 
his eyes were not open, he would look relaxed enough to be asleep.  He has a 
medium-length, silver beard and his eyes are grey.  He looks as though he 
was giving a lecture, gesticulating fervently, but the words are muted, as 
if only meant for a certain audience.

      <desc>Hilda the Unholy is a witch presumably, but there is very little that remains visible of her as she sits upon a dark chair, fully robed. The focus of the portrait is Hilda herself, but her surroundings look very much like the Great Hall. Beneath her feet as she sits, it is written: &quot;Hilda the Unholy is so called because of her half Vampiric parentage. She was Headmistress of Hogwarts and Head of Ravenclaw House between 1240 and 1255.&quot;

      <desc>Cedric Hammerfast is a very broad shouldered wizard, in black robes, held together by a sash. There is a wand in his left hand and a great hammer in his right. He looks to be practising some sort of two handed combat as he whirls around in movements which hold his wand always steady and available, while his hammer strikes at invisible enemies around. He is tall and red haired, with a reddish-brown beard. Beneath his portrait, there are a few words: &quot;Cedric Hammerfast, Champion of the Order of Odin.&quot;

      <desc>Lucia the Magnificent is a beautiful, radiating witch, in bright pink robes. She has golden hair and bright blue eyes and her skin is the colour of ivory. She sits gracefully upon a silver throne and occasionally resettles her hair. Her right hand holds an ebony wand and every now and again she flicks it, making fresh flowers rain around her.

reddish-brown wooden shelves cover the walls.  Small, corked, oddly-shaped 
glass containers are filled with fine dusty substances of all colors.  Two

 Exits lie to the east and the west through a tall rectangular stone frame.

      <desc>The portrait on the North side is that of a white haired wizard with 
terrible, blue eyes, continuously mixing the contents of a potion within a 
silver cauldron.  He is past his thirties and he wears black robes with a 
silver serpent embroidered on his sleeves.  The quotation beneath the 
portrait reads: &quot;Eliazar Flamekindler, Potions Professor at Hogwarts School 
of Witchcraft and Wizardry 1922-1936.  He was famous for always using a 
silver cauldron for his potions.&quot;  The portrait on the South side is that of 
a black haired witch, with high cheekbones and a meditative face.  She is 
very young and smiles slightly as she stirs the contents of a clear potion 
with a long, golden stirrer.  There is wisdom in her face and a patient but 
persistent inquisitiveness gleams in her eyes.  She wears robes of dark blue 
silk, with a golden sash.  The quotation underneath the portrait reads: 
&quot;Athena Elizabeth Dumbledore, mother of Albus Dumbledore, inventor of 
Veritaserum, and the only human being known to have tamed a unicorn.&quot;

of this chamber in misty, ethereal shapes, coloured reddish-brown, like 
wood.  The scent of fresh spring rain never leaves the place, although it 
has no apparent reason for being there.  There is a portrait on the north 
wall and one on the south side.  They are both very large and symmetrically 
placed, with deep-green velvet curtains framing them.  The floor is very 
smooth and the stonework has been covered by dark-coloured wood.  There are

The portrait on the north side is of an elderly gentleman, perhaps a bit too kind in appearance, but very shrewd-looking. Focusing on either one of them might reveal more details about them.

      <desc>The portrait on the south side represents a man in his early thirties.  His 
hair is very light blonde, nearly white, and his expression is very serious 
and distant.  He has very brightly-gleaming blue eyes and his lips are very 
straight and expressionless.  He wears the green robes of a Slytherin, with 
a silver serpent embroidered on his chest.  He has silver-coloured gloves 
on his hands and a wand is clutched in his left hand.  The caption beneath 
the portrait says: &quot;Salazar Black, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of 
Witchcraft and Wizardry, 1756-1778, Slytherin head of House between 
1745-1755.  Superb in Legillimency and Occlumency, Salazar Black left his 
mark on the school's defences, which he improved by adding a number of 
Mind-Protecting charms.&quot;

      <desc>The portrait of an elderly, smiling wizard, has been pinned on the north 
side of this chamber.  He is dressed in the robes of Hufflepuff house, 
yellow with a small badger on them and his smile is very calm and warm.  He 
delights in seeing students pass by and sometimes waves at them from his 
seated position.  His eyes are twinkling in a friendly fashion, but they 
have nothing of Professor Dumbledore's inquisitiveness in them.  There are a 
few words written beneath the portrait.  &quot;Armando Dippet, Headmaster of 
Hogwarts, 1935-1954, Head of Hufflepuff House 1910-1935.  Headmaster Dippet 
faced an attack from within Hogwarts as the Chamber of Secrets was opened 
during his mandate.  The culprit was soon caught and the attacks stopped, 
regrettably only after a student was killed.  Professor Dippet wished to 
resign, but the parents insisted he'd stay.  In his last years at Hogwarts, 
Professor Dippet became very interested in research and enriched the 
Hogwarts library with more volumes than a fifth of what it previously  
had.&quot;

The angry judge is a very severe-looking man, with eyes that seem fanatic: raging and powerful. The woman beside him clutches at his arm, her knuckles white. Moody and Dumbledore can be seen in the row of judges, their expressions disgusted within the tapestry.

fact that someone, somehow, has accidentally built it upside-down.  A plush, 
plum-coloured carpet looks soft and cosy, plastered to the ceiling.  Stiff 
chandeliers stick straight out of the stucco floor.  Candles are installed 
upside-down, their flames burning into the wax.  Beautiful panelling 
stretches to the east and west exits.  A formal, old-fashioned portrait is 
hung the wrong way round, its sole inhabitant giggling insanely.  To top it 
all off, a small sign is pinned to the wall, reading &quot;Sorry for the

    <desc>The air in this corridor is thick with incense, burning fastidiously in 
suspended iron censers.  The imposing walls are assembled from huge blocks 
of ashen basalt with strands of pure silver woven across the entire surface. 
 The floor is a deep shade of iridescent juniper, throwing the reflected 
light into shards of incredible beauty.  Collecting by the walls and along 
the ledges of the windows lie smooth grey pebbles, each with an inlaid 
figure or form.  Upon casting a pebble to the floor, liquid-like ripples 
circle out from the point of impact, though the surface remains solid.  The 
exit is through a large, round arch to the east or between two stout columns 
to the west.

decorated with stars and planets.  Marble pillars stand on either side of

    <desc>This passage would be dark and spooky were it not for the low steps leading 
to a grand chair right in the northwestern corner of it.  The chair is 
spotlighted by two very bright orbs shedding a brilliant light which 
extends as far as the steps.  The rest of the corridor is quite dark with 
only vague random clouds of light within.  There are red curtains at the 
sides of the chair and there is a portrait set upon this throne where a 
person should sit.  There are exits to the south and to the east of this 
chamber.

      <desc>The chair is made of gold mixed with dark silver. It looks much like a 17th Century French piece of art, except that the dark silver carvings follow an oriental pattern with leaves and willow branches. The chair's legs all end in ruby red cushions and there is a similar one on the seat. The portrait rests against the back of the chair, which is covered in ruby red silk and against this pillow.

      <desc>There is a majestic looking wizard on this throne, with dashing, long, 
brilliantly silver hair dancing about him.  He has his arms spread in an 
embrace and his deep-red, velvet robes flutter behind him, as if caught in a 
violent wind.  The hat on the wizard's head may be recognized by students as 
an earlier, better looking and non-talking version of the Sorting Hat.  His 
face is is severe, but very clever, his features very fine chiselled, not 
those of an old man.  He wears a necklace with a red vial at the end.  The 
wizard floats gently on the canvas and the shadow of a great gryphon begins 
to materialize beneath his feet only to disappear and reappear later.  There 
is a short caption underneath the picture, which says: Godric Gryffindor, 
founder of Hogwarts.  This chair has been made in honour of Gryffindor by 
Apollodor of Rome, in the year 1153.  It was used for each year's sorting 
while Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin coexisted within the 
school.

    <desc>All along this deep-crimson corridor, brightly colored fairies flit about, 
making homes in the crevices and hovering by the ceiling like a swarm of 
bees.  Irritated students have imprisoned some of the creatures in bubbles, 
now resembling floating Christmas lights.  There are no light fixtures 
installed, but the multi-colored light generated by the cheerful fairies is 
enough to guide the way.  Some parts of the passageway are too choked up 
with fairies to see through.

class decorated the walls with pictures.  The floor is covered by a single, 
long, dark-blue carpet with yellow tassels on its four corners.  Posing on a 
pedestal on the western side of the hallway is a wolf carved from stone.  
The corridor is lit by a few wax candles shaped like balls; they are sitting 
on wrought iron stands along the edge of the corridor.  To the south are 
multiple faeries, The Hall of 99 Faeries.  To the north is Palm-trees

    <desc>The large, squared windows allow an Oriental, faint, light inside this 
corridor, through branches of exotic bushes.  Thick vines line the grey, 
stone walls in a labyrinth of intricate shapes.  Palm trees stretch in the 
earth-covered floor, their leaves spreading in sharp-tipped fingers, which 
head towards the ceiling.  The whole north-eastern corner of the corridor 
looks like a bright mass of green.  However, the exotic trees only grow 
before the windows, in the sunlight.  The rest of the corridor is thrown 
into semi-darkness during the day, with nearly no light at night.  The roof 
of this room is arched protectively around the tips of the palm-trees, but 
flat everywhere else.  There are exits to the south and to the west.

    <desc>This cluttered room is very difficult to navigate, mainly because of the 
various ladders scattered around, and intermingled with the occasional 
stuffed snake's skin, hanging down from above.  On closer inspection, it 
appears that the ladders lead to wooden platforms just above head-height, 
giving a two-tiered effect to the room.  The snakes' skins hang from these 
same platforms, almost like ropes to be climbed down.  The floor is formed 
by a tiled checkerboard pattern, with alternating squares forming a bright 
red and yellow pattern.  A sickening, fluorescent green wallpaper covers the 
walls, while the ceiling is obscured from view by the rotting, wooden 
planks.  Clambering through this obstacle course will reward the pedestrian 
with access to the west, where water can be heard; to the north, where one 
can find a stairwell; and to the east, where palm trees grow.

different shades of brown, yellow, and black.  The slimy looking skins all 
hang still and lifeless, but with long, dangerous fangs that are 
nevertheless discomforting.

    <desc>There is a short staircase with fifteen steps leading down towards a small, 
sheltered area.  There are torches lining the damp, dungeon-like walls, but 
they stop before the staircase.  Their light is barely enough not to trip 
down the steps, and the quality of the reddish rays is uncertain, casting 
permanently moving shadows on the walls.  The stairs lead down towards a 
marble fountain, guarded by four gargoyles.  The low, secluded area where 
the fountain is placed is circular in shape and it has blue curtains along 
the walls.  There is a similar fifteen-step staircase on the other side.  
The corridor runs onwards towards the east or the west.

      <desc>The fountain looks like a goblet fit for a giant in size, but finely carved by an undoubtedly very skilled craftsman. There are S shaped spirals, slightly resting backwards, along the cup and the foot of the goblet is thin, with a sort of kunckle above halfway down. The four gargoyles are bent over the fountain, their eyes giving a sort of yellowish-orange light in the darkness whenever somebody is next to them.

      <desc>The Gargoyles are portrayed in a crouched, wary position, wings hitched up, faces down. They are made of dark stone, the colour indistinguishable in the darkness. Their eyes are half opened and the pupils irradiate a sort of strange orange flicker on the water. Students don't generally drink from it - they say it serves only the thirst of those who guard it.

can be made out amongst the many intricate models.

    <desc>Dense spider webs cover the stone walls of the corridor, obscuring the exits 
on the east and west sides.  The tangled mess of webs also shrouds the 
ornate carvings of spiders that decorate the walls.  Torches are placed 
sparingly on either side of the corridor, but the billowing spider webs 
quickly smother the firelight that emanates from them.  The floor's wooded 
paneling is covered in a thin layer of dust that is punctured here and there 
by footmarks.  An enormous granite statue of a jumping spider looms at the 
southern end of the passage.

      <desc>The spider is easily 10' tall, yet for all its massiveness it appears quite 
graceful.  The legs are posed to make it look as if it is in mid jump.  All 
of its eight eyes are focused in different directions, as though searching 
for prey.

    <desc>Flickers of light from many luminescent candles illuminate bits and slivers of the walls and stone floor.  Torches are mounted inside symmetric recesses of the wall.  Engraved at the top of these stone alcoves are curvy patterns contributing to the antique feel of the corridor.  The ground has many loose stones that cannot support heavy weight.  These stones are crumbling, indicating their wear and tear from the inhabitants of Hogwarts.  The walls do not show such extreme signs of age, yet there are cracks of varying lengths throughout the walls.  The ceiling is low and the walls close, giving the corridor a claustrophobic feel.  The potions classroom is located further down the hall and to the east.

    <desc>The corridor is lit by odd torches, burning with blue flames in their 
brackets.  There are tapestries decorating the otherwise empty stone walls.  
A gold-coloured carpet is spread on the floor.  The corner of this chamber 
is filled by a statue of a witch standing upon a golden pedestal.  She looks 
wise and powerful, robes shown as fluttering behind.  The corridor continues 
on both sides of the corner, to the north and to the west.

beneath her cheekbones and her eyebrows arched gracefully above her eyes.  
She holds a broomstick in her left hand and a long, ebony wand in her right. 
 There is a note on the pedestal beneath her feet, reading: &quot;Rowena 
Ravenclaw, founder of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  She is 
the inventor of many hexes and charms and was Quidditch champion five times 
for England, as Chaser.&quot;

    <desc>Shhhhhhhhrrrrrrrrrrr... The annoying sound of a constant, loud shushing 
fills this room, causing headaches for those who enter.  Billions of tiny 
black and white dots completely cover the walls, floor, and ceiling of this 
bizarre corridor.  Rather than sitting still, the dots dance around the room 
surfaces in some form of an insane, energetic dance.  The room surfaces are 
perfectly smooth, like glass, and slightly slippery.  They also have a harsh 
white light glaring through them.  With all things considered, this corridor 
is a rather painful one to linger in.  Passersby tend to rush through here 
to the east, to a room that honours Rowena Ravenclaw, or to the west, to a 
decaying corridor.

      <desc>The black and white dots on the room's surfaces are tiny, and move about in 
a constant interplay.  They are hypnotic, and at the same time that you find 
it hard to look away, you find that strange, grey, three-dimensional figures 
are forming in your mind.  These figures are ghostly, and take some time to 
form recognisable pictures; but in the blink of an eye, they are gone.

    <desc>This wide corridor houses a fine collection of artwork.  The walls are lined with frames, layered on top of each other, which are lit by an elegant silver chandelier.  There are no windows or other means of lighting along the walls, just painting after painting.  Several paintings stand out.  One is of a wizard's duel.  Another frame shows a portrait of possibly the ugliest wizard on earth.  He is a squat man, with an expression of intense disgust on his face.  He has a large mole on his right cheek and a smug mouth.  Opposite him is a picture of a prancing unicorn.  It is fully grown, with a shining white coat and a long horn.  The unicorn is at the edge of a thick, dark forest.  The green forest is dark against the sandstone walls and floor of the corridor.  There are exits to the north, east, and west.

    <desc>The statue of Boris the Bewildered, (a lost-looking wizard with his gloves 
on the wrong hands,) sits in this long corridor with its back against the 
northern wall.  There are a multitude of stained glass windows lining the 
walls on each side.  Covering the floor is a long rug, home to a mural 
composed of many different colors.  A giant chandelier hangs from the 
ceiling, casting a warm light about the room.  The light makes visible a 
classroom to the south.  There are two openings to the east and west that 
lead to adjoining corridors.

The mural is divided into portions, each showing a different scene.  Portion 
one shows a lovely island surrounded by deep blue waters.  In portion two 
there is a closer view of the island, which has a picturesque palace in the 
centre.  Tired looking men march up to the palace in the next scene.  In the 
last scene there is a large group of swine in front of the palace, where the 
weary men once stood.  Opposite the mural is a wall of black granite, empty 
of any windows or decorations.  Several candles float overhead, faintly 
illuminating the hall.  The floor is dirt, with some sort of scraggly weed 
poking up here and there.  Two large exits lead to the east and west.

    <desc>This corridor represents the interior of a temple.  The entrance is marked 
by two Corinthian style columns of clean and white Greek stone.  There are a 
few stone steps leading to a circular chamber, where a statue of a man 
stands in focus.  He is shown in a proud and cold pose, his hands crossed, 
gazing from far above at those who come.  The inside of this stony temple is 
lit by a circle of torches that burn a distant red light.  There is a plain 
altar before the statue of this god and the smoking remains of a sacrifice 
rise permanently up, beaten sometimes sideways by a strange breeze that 
seems to come as if the statue breathes.  The circular temple has open 
column-marked exits on all four sides.

On all sides, a name is carved in capital Greek letters in the following order: Alpha, Pi, Omicron, Lambda, Lambda, Omega, Nu, framed by olive branches. The letters are carved into stone, but also traced with gold in the carvings. The offer on the Altar is impossible to recognize, as it is reduced to smoking ashes.

    <desc>Cobwebs form thick curtains in the windows of this dusty room, letting in 
little light.  Tacky, scuffed, pale-green linoleum peeks through from 
between the many, many archive boxes filling the room.  The boxes themselves 
are all made from cardboard and coated in a thick layer of dust.  It seems 
that they haven't been touched for decades.  An unusually high tower of the 
boxes has been built against the southern wall; it teeters precariously, 
appearing extremely unstable. The only exit is to the east.

      <desc>The boxes are scattered all over the room in a rather disorganised manner.  
The thick layer of dust can be wiped away to reveal ordinary, closed, brown, 
cardboard boxes.  Years have also been recorded on each box, apparently 
marking the graduation year of the students whose records reside within.  
The youngest box here seems to be dated from sixty years ago.

    <desc>Somewhere here, hidden beneath a colossal mess, is a professor's office.  
There are piles of papers everywhere.  The piles seem to be parted in a 
pathway linking the two exits, north and east.  The papers teeter like 
waves, arching perilously above.  Bookshelves against one wall are 
completely filled with an assortment of boring-looking books and against 
another wall is a vaguely desk-shaped object; the mess and clutter obscures 
its surface from view.

would look as though nobody lived here, if it wasn't for a single suitcase 
and two boxes.  Beside this is a large elm wardrobe, and directly opposite

    <desc>This classroom consists of twenty old, wooden desks with stools at them.  
Each has a space in the desktop for an inkwell and a small ledge under the 
desktop to store books and parchment.  A blackboard mounted at the front of 
the room is blank, except for a string of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs 
written along its left side.  Concentration is difficult in this classroom, 
for at regular five-minute intervals, the three windows against the northern 
wall all blink, and when they open again, show a different view than they 
had before.  The only exit is south.

      <desc>Each of the twenty desks in this room is wooden, and has been painted a 
mud-brown colour.  Some of them have deep grooves engraved in them, where 
students have tried to carve their names, noughts and crosses boards, or 
merely abstract doodles.  Someone has carved what appears to be a dark mark 
on the side of one of the back desks.

    <desc>The air in this timber-lined room chills all who enter.  The floor here is 
made of dark beams and is covered with a fine layer of sand and algae.  
Large naphtha torches glow steadily on brass supports, bathing everything 
with a sickly amber light.  A huge iron anchor, blood brown and dulled from 
rust, hangs proudly on the west wall.  It gives an air of solid defiance and 
immense power.  A pervading sense of the ocean carries through the sounds 
and smells of the room, waves crashing and salt sprays, gull cries and 
sodden oak.  A large, hand carved plaque bolted above the anchor reads: 
&quot;Beware the walls, beware the floor, keep the spirits from our door&quot;.

    <desc>This narrow corridor is musty and claustrophobic.  Out of the oppressive 
blackness, an ominous glow issues from four hovering spheres.  Covering the 
floor is hard grey marble, echoing every footfall.  Ornate ebony walls snake 
in and out creating narrow squeezes and tight turns.  Running the entire 
length of the ceiling is a carving in deep red wood with pale white 
detailing.  It depicts many wizards pointing their wands at a massive hydra. 
 An unreadable inscription runs around the carving, the strange symbols 
picked out in ivory.  The corridor curves away to the east and the west.

breathtaking expanse, the deepest black marble, as smooth as liquid, covers 
the floor.  Thin veins of pure white line the surface giving the illusion of 
tides on a miniature ocean.  Encasing the circular chamber are stout, pale 
rose Corinthian columns, dividing the walls into seven equal parts.  
Recessed between the columns are huge alcoves, twice the height of a man, 
each with an intricate fresco painted inside.  The paintings are dark and 
foreboding, telling a great legend of wizarding past.  The flickering 
torches mounted on the columns send weak tendrils of light out into the 
void, hoping to caress any object or person that may linger a while in the 
cold.  The exit is a small corridor to the east.

as are the tops of the windows.  There are three windows lining the eastern 
wall, three enormous windows that let the sunlight stream through.  An 
elegant silver chandelier hangs from the centre of the ceiling, its candles 
illuminating the hallway.  Blue tiles decorate the walls, and other tiles 
form pictures of animals.  There are dragons and bulls in brown and yellow.  
The tiles are glazed, so the walls shine in the candlelight of the 
chandelier.  The floor is one smooth, continuous piece of sandstone.  There 
are exits to the north and west.

      <desc>The spinning wheel is made from polished pinewood, and is in perfect working 
condition.  In fact, it looks as though it has rarely been used at all.  A 
small amount of straw has been scattered about, underneath the wheel, 
probably blown by a draft of wind.  There is a small engraving on the 
locking maiden bar; the thick, horizontal bar of wood that joins on to the

and light.  Elegant panelled walls surround a luxurious, maroon carpet that 
furnishes the floor.  A comfortable sofa hugs one corner of the room.  On 
the other side of the room is a large study desk with chairs around it.  The 
room's single painting, proudly displayed on the southern wall, depicts a 
bowl of ripe fruit.  The only exit is to the north.

    <desc>Pink brick blankets the walls and lies under the feet of all who enter.  The 
stucco ceiling is a motley compilation of miscellaneous pinks.  Fuchsia 
candles float midair casting rose-coloured light in this windowless room.  
No desks grace this classroom; instead, only a ledge, blush in tone, 
surrounds the room like a step.  This sill provides the only respite from 
standing.  The designer of this space concluded that pink was just rankling 
enough one could actually 'feel' her or his existential being.  
Salmon-coloured bookshelves hold many volumes of books with titles such as, 
'You Can't Spell Witchcraft Without I', and 'Ennui and Enchantments'.  The 
exit is on the south side of the classroom.

    <desc>Mmm... the fresh scent of lemons hangs in the air of this meticulously clean 
room.  The pale yellow walls, combined with a large window on the northern 
wall, make this room airy and bright.  Floor-length white curtains match the 
thick, soft carpet.  While some might avoid white for fear of stains, it is 
hard to imagine that this spotless carpet could ever be dirty.  A large, 
neatly made bed rests against the western wall, and a wardrobe has been 
lined up directly opposite the window.  Above the bed hangs a portrait of a 
kindly, older woman.  The only exit is to an office, to the east.

    <desc>This large sitting room seems to have been untouched by the castle's modern 
occupants.  Rich, woven tapestries adorn the walls, and the hard, cold, 
stone floor is completely bare.  A single arch-shaped window sits on the 
southern wall, with no window frame or glass pane at all.  Beside the window 
sits an ancient chair, accompanied by a small side table.  On the side table 
sits some form of handicraft.  The eastern wall features a fireplace, in 
which a gentle fire burns, and on the western wall hangs a large mirror.

long, flowing dress gathered around her waist with a woven belt.  Her long, 
blonde hair hangs freely around her neck and shoulders, and her deep blue

    <desc>Rather than a square room with doors in it, this claustrophobic passageway 
forms an elbow, with exits to the north and east.  The walls, ceiling, and 
floor are all made from the same dark, oppressive rock slabs, which seem to 
be barely held into place.  The walls rumble alarmingly, and occasionally 
dust and small gravel particles fall from the ceiling, causing passing 
students to wheeze and cough.

    <desc>The walls of this corridor radiate an intrinsic, kind light.  The room is 
filled with a fresh scent, without sweetness or bitterness, a little like 
mint.  There is a single, muggle portrait on the north wall.  A choir-like 
sound of soft, gentle, yet powerful, voices reflects off the stone walls.  
The ceiling is arched with a spiral of laurel branches leading towards the 
top of the ceiling.  There are exits to the south, east, and west of this 
chamber.

      <desc>This muggle painting shows a kind-faced man with shoulder-length locks of 
chestnut hair speaking to a woman, who is bent before him and weeping.  The 
man has a halo of light around his hair and his chestnut beard suits his 
face well.  He is wearing bright ancient robes.  The woman's face is barely 
visible under her black hair that falls in heavy waves, masking her 
features.  She too wears ancient robes.

      <desc>The painting shows a one-year-old girl wobbling delicately on her feet.  She 
has sparkling hazel eyes and a full head of curly, brown hair.  The child 
looks right at you, and then takes two wobbly steps, before landing on her 
bottom with a bump.  Nevertheless, she seems pleased with her achievement, 
and she chuckles and claps her hands.

canopy bed rests in the centre of this haven with diaphanous Tussah silk 
draped over the top and sides, resembling a shimmering jewel.  A chenille, 
cabernet-red coverlet spreads across the bed, concealing the bronze-coloured 
China silk sheets nestled within.  At the foot of the bed lies an ivory 
chenille rug.  A crystal chandelier holds translucent candles allowing 
delicate light to caress the room.  A crystal bowl holds sweet strawberries 
and grapes.  A pool of translucid water sparkles, inviting any who wish, 
into its warm waters.  Delicate, tiny orange blossoms and flowers of jasmine 
float down from the ceiling emitting their faint scent into the air.  The 
room allows any inhabitant to think of a tune, a song, or sound and it will 
begin to play softly or loudly, contingent upon the desire of the 
individual.

    <desc>A large canopy bed is the focal point of this chamber, and it occupies the centre of the room with the head post to the northern wall. Four gleaming walnut posts stand at the corners of the bed, dark and rich with age. Curtains made of rich azure velvet are draped over them, and they cascade to the top of the arched feet that support the entire structure. Covering the entirety of the floor, the plush slate carpet underneath springs back after any footfall. A self-organizing wardrobe with fluid, lissom embellishments carved into its sides is set against the eastern wall. On top, potion vials in a spectrum of colours are lined up in order of size. The rightmost and largest flask lacks a stopper, and the scent of sandalwood rises from its open neck. The western wall supports a tall, oak-framed mirror. An oil painting of a stormy seascape hangs on the southern wall. To the south is the sole exit.

chamber a surreal feeling.  The walls and ceiling are a pale sky blue, the 
colour you would see close to the horizon on a clear, winter's morn.  No 
artificial light source is necessary here; the walls glow gently as though 
Lady Sol herself is present, but hiding from view.  A gentle, yet crisp and 
clear, breeze circulates through the room, making the drapes of the canopied 
bed, which is against the northern wall, flutter and furl.  The only exit is 
to the south.

    <desc>This dilapidated bathroom has seen better days.  Most all of its furnishings 
are tinged green, like a sick lime.  All of the toilet cubicles are on the 
east side of the room; the bolts fastening the cubicle doors are loose.  On 
the west side of the room there are a few bathtubs and several showers, made 
from cold, solid, white marble.  The bathtubs have delicately carved clawed 
feet, like those of a raven's.  The dark, gold paint covering the feet is 
starting to flake off like a lizard shedding its skin.  The shower heads are 
hanging loosely from the wall, covered in calcium and lime deposits.  The 
floor is tiled with solid white marble that is slowly turning a sickly green 
colour to match the rest of the bathroom.  Mortar holding the tiles together 
is missing in places, allowing for the tiles to move out of place.  Dim 
lanterns illuminate the livid scene casting a ghost like glow over the 
surroundings.  To the north is the door that leads into the Corridor of 
Infancy.

    <desc>Bright, transparent vases with candles burning within their glass confines 
illuminate this place of bathing.  On the southern wall there are cubicles 
made of imitation silver, hiding the toilets within them and their users 
from public view.  Along the eastern part of the room are several bathtubs 
and a few sinks.  The rim of each bathtub looks like a golden wedding band, 
while the rest is coloured off-white.  Two imitation silver sinks reside 
next to each bathtub.  A motley bunch of bottles fills the northern wall, 
some are filled with shampoos, others with flower petals.  The room is 
filled with many scents and perfumes ranging from Apple Blossoms, to Essence 
of Spinach.  The featureless western exit leads into The Hall of 
Forgiveness.

    <desc>A large tapestry hangs on the western wall, concealing much of the white paint behind the rich blue of the cloth. The northern wall is painted black, and many Arithmancy reference charts are attached to it. They are arranged somewhat haphazardly, a great contrast to the strict logic of the numbers and symbols written on them. To the north sits a large desk, which faces the door to the east. There is nothing on the desk save a day-to-day calendar that disintegrates a page each midnight and a modernistic wire sculpture that rearranges itself sporadically. The only other features of interest are the series of numbers run along the top and bottom of the walls, forming a continuous line around the room. The wall to the east is white, and the wall to the south is painted black, so that opposite walls are the same colour. Both are unadorned. To the east is the hall, and to the south, Professor Victoria Vector's quarters.

    <desc>A contorted sculpture of bronze ribbons and steel rods partially blocks the door to the north, allowing it to open just enough for a slender person to slide through. The furnishings are sparse but tasteful; geometric figures in shades of grey rise from the hardwood floor on an oval rug at the foot of the bed. Unlike the students' and many of the teachers', this bed lacks the requisite frilled canopy, although its head and foot are embellished with slashed designs. By the head of the bed rests a table, and a short six-sided glass column glows with a clear white light.

    <desc>This ordinary-looking classroom has a pleasant atmosphere, with two large 
windows on the eastern wall providing plenty of light, and a potted bonsai, 
sitting on the teacher's desk, gives the room some gentle greenery.  The 
blackboard has been cleaned in preparation for the next class, and 
twenty-three wooden students' desks are lined up, waiting to be occupied.  
This classroom would be completely boring, if it weren't for the students 
occasionally entering the room by sliding down a green slide from the west, 
and landing with a bump on a large, green cushion that has been placed where 
a door would normally stand.  A platform to the side of the cushion allows 
students to climb out the only exit, to the west.

weeds sits around the base of the tree, and a tiny porcelain figure sits 
beside them.

grabbing a nearby rake, starts attacking the weeds at the base of the tree 
violently.  He occasionally takes a break, wiping his forehead with the 
sleeve of his bright red shirt, and sneaking a look up at you, almost as 
though he is checking to see if you are still watching him.

    <desc>A thick layer of dust fills every crevice of this small room, threatening to 
fly up and choke the unwary passer-by who disturbs it.  A frayed, 
vomit-yellow carpet clashes with slightly stained, lime-green wallpaper that 
has thin, white, vertical stripes.  The expansive antique desk in the center 
of the room has the tiniest amount of free space left for working; the rest 
is taken up by a variety of useless muggle office equipment.  Someone has 
cunningly enchanted a light bulb to hover in mid-air, lighting the room.  A 
rickety bookshelf against the western wall is filled with books.  There are 
exits to the east and south.

      <desc>At first glance, the appearance of a fishy screensaver seems to indicate 
that the computer is functional.  On closer inspection, however, it can be 
seen that someone has cunningly transferred the computer monitor into a fish 
tank.  A small school of clownfish swims past merrily; as their bright 
orange and white stripes disappear a blue angelfish swims to the front of 
the monitor and goggles at you.  Soon, however, it is alarmed, and swims 
away quickly.  A long, thick, orange tentacle curls slowly into view.  
Surely this beast is too large to be an ordinary squid!  What sort of crazy 
aquarium is this?

    <desc>A large brass chandelier, hanging from a low ceiling, bathes lightly stained wooden walls in an amber glow. The gold-carpeted floor of the hall is surprisingly springy.  Tucked in the corner is a rickety looking chair.  A well-worn knitted blanket with stripes of hunter, gold, crimson, and navy is carelessly tossed over the back of the chair.  A small pile of books, with tattered leather covers of red and brown are gathered at the foot of the rocker.  The rocker faces the east wall, which is graced by a portrait of a stately, steel haired woman cloaked in strawberry smiles down. Her brown eyes are warm and inviting. The soft gray and white cat lounging at her feet waves his tail lazily in greeting.  A crimson red cherry door marks the exit to the west.

    <desc>From the uneven marble walls hangs an assortment of rusty lanterns, casting their forlorn light on the slick, stone floor. Wavering and uneven, the light has an eerie orange glow. The ceiling here is very low and the dusty wooden rafters are adorned with cobwebs and bird nests. A deep crimson tapestry with a large eye in the middle hangs on the north wall. In the white of the eye the latin phrase, &quot;Vide et credere&quot;, is inscribed.  A corridor from the east and west filter in to this passage and lead to the massive cast iron doors guarding the southern exit.

    <desc>The floor of the corridor is split into wide bands running horizontally from wall to wall. Tinted dark and light slate, they resemble a giant keyboard and shift up and down as though the fingers of a Titan were dancing across them. In a small alcove carved into the southern wall, a marble bust of Bach gazes downward. He smiles approvingly as the clear, dainty notes of a harpsichord ring out. Over and over, the tune of the Goldberg Variations tinkles through the air. The western wall showcases pages and pages of faded manuscript written in the baroque composer's own hand. A short passageway lies to the east, and a classroom to the north.

      <desc>The proud visage of one of history's most revered composers is immortalized in a block of white marble. A ribbon holds back his hair, or rather the wig covering his hair. On the pedestal, the inscription reads &quot;Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750)&quot; and &quot;Bring me a bowl of coffee before I turn into a goat&quot; on the next line.

    <desc>The fresh smell of squashed berries fills this chamber with a sweet, and yet 
slightly acrid, smell.  The walls are covered with a thin coat of green, in 
the shape of small branches and leaves.  Low on the sides of the corridor, 
at the point where the vertical walls meet the ground, are fresh, small 
berries.  Light comes in through the old, large windows on the east and 
south sides, and the cheerful rays change colour every now and again, as 
they bathe in new and unexpected tinges of red or blue.  The shade of the 
light changes from similar changes in the glass of the windows.  A slight, 
fresh breeze goes through this room at irregular intervals.  There are exits 
to the north and to the west.

      <desc>The windows are very large, with rounded upper margins to sweeten the sharp, otherwise square, shape of the glass. They look somewhat ethereal, as if they were solidified drops of a rainbow. Rain does not stick to them and no storm can make them rattle or tremble like it does ordinary old windows. They have no handle that would allow them to open, but most students say that on sunny days, the windows open on their own, disappearing for a while as if they'd never existed.

    <desc>An office is located on this level of the tower, one that has fallen into disuse for quite some time. Facing the only window is a small desk with spindly legs, barely larger than that of a student. It holds nothing but a thick layer of dust, though the grime is cleared in two handprint-shaped spots. The solitary chair has the same rustic appearance, a crude assembly of assorted wooden rods and planks. Several feet away, a cardboard box wiggles and shuffles around on the top of a bookshelf - the forgotten toy of a student 100 years ago. An oval carpet that once was a rich cream covers half the floor between the desk and the staircases leading up and down, which are across the room.

    <desc>Dried grass woven into a mat covers the floor of this rather unconventional 
classroom.  The walls are made from vertical sticks of bamboo, wired tightly 
together, so that it looks like the inside of a hut on a tropical island.  
There are a couple of small, square windows on the northern side; completely 
unadorned, they are merely holes cut in the wall, allowing a generous sea 
breeze access to the room.  A short, squat, three-legged stand holds a 
blackboard low to the ground.  There are no desks here; instead, there is a 
pile of cushions and another pile of wooden boards.  The only exit to the 
room is to a corridor, southwards.

      <desc>A large pile of cushions is stacked against the western wall.  They are in 
many different natural shades of greens and browns, but are all of the same 
size and shape; small squares, the right size for someone to kneel on them.  
They aren't very thick, but the padding in them is quite strong and 
supportive.

      <desc>Instead of desks, this room seems to have an assortment of small wooden 
lap-boards.  It seems that the students are to kneel on a cushion, and then 
balance one of these small rectangular boards on their lap while they write. 
 The surfaces of the boards are at a slight angle, so that the top of the 
board sits higher than the lower edge, which has a small, raised ledge.  The 
boards are all neatly stacked, and undamaged; perhaps they are not used 
often.

instead of the streaked look that a freshly cleaned blackboard sometimes 
has, it is a perfectly even, midnight black colour, as though it were either 
brand new or freshly repainted.

    <desc>The stairwell is placed in the centre of a circular area.  It spirals upward 
in a wide horizontal arc to reach the upper floor.  It is made of a white 
marble that is smooth and undamaged.  A navy blue stretch of carpet rolls 
down the middle of the staircase, but you can still see the marble on the 
outer edges and banisters.  The floor is made of the same material as the 
staircase, but it is unadorned.  Two ancient suits of armour hold lanterns 
at the bottom of the steps.  A large, domed window sits adjacent to the 
staircase on the east.  To the west is a door that leads into a room.

    <desc>This long, steep stairway in the Astronomy Tower, one of Hogwarts tallest 
towers, is decorated in vivid colours.  The walls are a cheerful pale 
yellow.  The wooden steps gleam in the light from the enormous windows that 
over look the castle grounds.  Deep purple curtains, covered in twinkling 
stars of various colors and brightnesses, just sweep the floor and outline 
the massive windows.  Brilliant sunshine beams in onto the exquisite 
lavender flowers in vases affixed along the walls of the acending stairs.  
The vases are crystal that swirls and ripples at the rim to mimic water.  
There are a couple pictures scattered along the walls.  One contains a 
dreadfully anxious looking elderly wizard, who is pacing back and forth in a 
luscious forest.  While in another an attractive witch with silvery blonde 
hair, plucks yellow roses from a large bush.

    <desc>Time passes by here continuously, leaving its unmistakable brand of erosion. Neither paintings nor decorations adorn the stark walls. However, they have a rather unusual texture of their own: moth-eaten, griddled with hairline cracks. At awkward intervals, large chunks of stone have crumbled away, exposing the raw, jagged face of the granite. The remaining jigsaw appears incapable of supporting the weight of the school, but somehow it stands up doggedly. The corridor stretches on to the south, but most of the wear marks fade after a few metres. To the west, it turns sharply where a section of missing stonework is particularly visible.

the room from a painting on the wall, and choking the innocent students who 
have the misfortune of wandering in.  The wooden floor has a trail of muddy 
footprints, leading to a pair of boots left unattended.  A large window, set 
in a lime green wall, provides ample light during the day, while a lamp on 
the wooden desk provides for light at night.  There is also a wooden chair, 
and a filing cabinet.  An assortment of fishing implements is lying against 
the wall.  The eastern doorway leads to a corridor, while to the north is a 
professor's residence.

      <desc>The painting that is attached to the wall shows a fisherman holding up his 
catch of the day, a huge fish.  Unfortunately, the fish is rather old now, 
and is both looking and smelling rather foul.  Its eyes bulge in shock, and 
its sickening yellow scales have begun to decay alarmingly, so that its 
actual species is difficult to determine.  The fisherman's face is a rather 
interesting shade of green, and he seems to be torn between striking a proud 
pose, and dropping the fish so that he can go and be sick.

dull and its silver banisters are tarnished.  The room itself is saturated 
in a heavy layer of dust, which belches a gritty, suffocating haze when 
disturbed.   Curious shapes, all obscured from view by an assortment of 
heavy, dusty blankets, border the circular room.  The one window is boarded 
up, but a single, broken board allows a small sliver of light to land on the 
otherwise dark floor.  The two exits are south and down.

sides, and a simple bronze stand and apex.  One of the glass panes has been

      <desc>The balls that fill this room are light, and hollow, and slightly larger 
than a tennis ball in size.  While they are all the standard solid colours 
that a muggle ball pit would have, they also have more distinctive patterns 
and shades.  One ball features opal swirls, and another glitters like gold.  
Yet another looks like clear glass, with smoky clouds drifting across its 
surface.

    <desc>This is a cozy, inviting hall. Its pale, lavender walls are host to many round windows with warped glass.   Along the sky blue ceiling are many paintings of Greek gods and goddesses.  Lightning bolts race across the ceiling after Aries who dodges them with ease. Zeus, who is already upset, is annoyed by fact that Aries is enjoying himself.  The floor is made of smooth pale blue stone and is a nice touch to this calming hall. The east wall has a painting attached to it of a smiling old man with fiery red eyes.  Large emerald drapes held back by silver ropes mark the exits to the north and the south.

divided lengthways by a set of train tracks that run through the room.  The 
actual composition of the ceiling is difficult to determine, as it is 
dirtied by a great deal of soot.  The exits to the north and the south of

    <desc>This room is an archive of the most gifted students Hogwarts has ever had.  
A board made of grey marble covers the south wall.  The portraits, names, 
houses, and subjects of students are listed upon it, ranked by the highest 
number of NEWT's they passed with Outstanding.  There are some thirty names 
listed on the board, with golden numbers beside them.  A bright light comes 
from the torches set one above the other at each side of the board, with 
about a foot's distance to separate them.  The brown carpet on the floor is 
soft and permanently clean, as is the board.  The closest any student has 
come to defile this room is a red beam that occasionally spells the word GIT 
across a portrait of Percy Weasley.  There are exits to the north, west, and 
east of this room.

      <desc>The grey board is very carefully chiseled, so that it draws the focus on the 
names upon it, rather than on itself.  A young, dark-haired wizard holds the 
top spot, followed by a forbidding-looking girl.  Also remarkable are three 
boys occupying together the third position, Marauders Forever written beside 
their names, house and subjects.  Percy Weasley is listed just below them.  
Looking at each of them in turn might reveal the details of their glory.

      <desc>The boy holding the first position is handsome in an ambitious, cold way.  
His blue eyes stare at onlookers with a stony expression on his face, and he 
never speaks.  He glares occasionally if students speak of muggle-related 
subjects.  He has black robes and pride exudes from his whole being.  It is 
as if he knows he will never be surpassed by anybody as long as Hogwarts 
exists.  His name is Tom Marvolo Riddle and he was a Slytherin.  It seems he 
has aced, by the looks of it, all his subjects: Defence against the Dark 
Arts, Charms, Transfiguration, Potions, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, Care of 
Magical Creatures, Astrology, and Divination.

waves of red hair falling heavily upon her silver dress robes.  She is 
Amelia Junona Bones, of Ravenclaw House, and she had Outstanding at Charms, 
Muggle Studies, Defence against the Dark Arts, Arithmancy, Transfiguration,

      <desc>The three wizards in third place are recognizable to most passers-by.  One 
was a teacher at Hogwarts for a year and known as a werewolf, the second 
wizard appears as a different version of Harry Potter, and the third is the 
well known Sirius Black, the first man to escape from Azkaban.  James Potter 
is portrayed in red and gold Quidditch robes, his hair upswept, and his 
deep-brown eyes glinting while he grins at passers-by.  Sirius Black is very 
young and extremely handsome, with dark, wavy hair framing his roguish and 
charming face.  Dressed in magnificent, black, dress robes, he has a smile 
that burns in his eyes and it is not difficult to understand what girls 
liked in him.  Remus Jarvis Lupin looks good-natured and vivid, the twinkle 
in his grey eyes similar to Professor Dumbledore's.  He wears his Hogwarts 
uniform proudly and beams upwards as he looks at his two friends.  They all 
used to be in Gryffindor House.  The three have Outstanding in the same 
subjects: Defence Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration, Potions, 
and Arithmancy.

torches.  The word GIT is displayed at random intervals upon his portrait.  
He has Outstanding in Divination, Muggle Studies, Astrology, and Potions.

    <desc>The dazzling and welcoming bright light of four torches gives this chamber a 
feeling of profound joy.  A single, marble statue stands in the middle of 
the room, representing a witch.  Dressed in robes which seem to fly behind 
her, repelled by a fierce wind, she has her arms spread sideways, palms up.  
In her left hand, she holds a Remembrall, while in her right, there is a 
white dove, ready to take its leave.  The soft and passionate tunes of a 
Celtic song reverberate off the stone walls covered in blinding white 
curtains.  There are exits to the east and west of this chamber.

slender legs is barely distinguishable beneath her robes, but she is clearly 
dancing.  She is pretty, with her eyes open and her lips parted in a smile 
of fierce freedom and happiness.  She faces the northern wall where golden 
letters spell the ardent message: &quot;Forgive, Live, and do not Forget!&quot;  The 
elegant signature below reads Cassiopeia Elena Dumbledore.

have been filled in.  The floor is made of the same stone laid out in an 
uneven number of rows, thirteen to be exact.  The ceiling, also of the dark 
stone, has been repaired similarly as the walls, except for a small patch 
near the wall Underneath this patch a ladder stands.  There are exits from

black.   The floor is a polished, black marble, and the walls have been

either side of the walls, holding wide black candles that both light the

four animals are a lion, rearing on its hind legs as though about to battle; 
an eagle, its wings spread in flight; a badger, its nose down and its front 
paws in a digging pose; and a coiled serpent, its head erect, as though 
ready to fight.

    <desc>This corridor is a labyrinth of sharp, white rocks.  There is no clear path 
visible, but just above the silhouette of a creature looms, catching the 
clear daylight coming through the clear, medium-sized, square windows.  The 
shadows this sculpture casts upon the rocks are those of a horned man, 
holding a shepherd's crook, a pipe, and a crown of tree needles.  Its legs 
finish not in feet, but in goat hooves.  The fresh scent of pine fills this 
room and there is something cheerful and wild in the atmosphere.  There are 
exits to the east and to the west of this room.

      <desc>The sculpture represents a satyr, a creature that has the torso of a man and 
the flanks, tail, and hooves of a goat.  This particular satyr looks 
mischievous and wild, its beard ruffled in a non-existent.  Its skin is 
wrinkled, but its eyes are laughing.  On his head there is a crown of pine 
needles and there are two goat horns on its otherwise human forehead.  It is 
holding a shepherd's crook in its left hand, and its hooves rest against a 
particularly sharp boulder.

      <desc>A class of students enters from the west. A gruff-looking teacher explains to the pupils, who are all Ravenclaws, what a satyr is. He identifies this particular satyr as Pan, the son of the Greek god Hermes and the woman Penelope, who later married Odysseus. The teacher mentions that Pan was a companion of Dionysus and is a god of fertility. A couple of female students giggle at this.</desc>

    <desc>This three-way intersection is pleasant and well lit, due mostly to the 
large window on the eastern wall, that lets in ample light.  The walls and 
floor are made from simple stone, but the floor is covered in a cheerful, 
yellow rug that complements the natural light from the window.  Exits are to 
the north, west, and south.

ample natural light.  The view from the window is breathtaking; the vast

view is from such a height.

      <desc>This old tapestry commemorates Barnabas the Barmy's memorable last moments, 
as he attempts to teach ballet to a group of trolls.  Barnabas stands in the 
center, dressed in a black leotard, with white tights and ballet shoes.  He 
is surrounded by a number of brutish, clumsy trolls, who seem intent on 
clubbing him.  A pile of oversized pink tutus lies to the side, abandoned, 
as does a very large barre, seemingly constructed from the trunk of a pine.

    <desc>. This three-way corridor is rather small.  The candelabrum hanging from the 
ceiling sheds some light on the red carpet that covers the floor.  The 
only wall which does not open into a hallway is the southern wall.  A 
painting, framed in silver, is hanging in the middle of this wall.  On 
either side, there are tapestries depicting the transformation of wizards 
and witches into animals.  There are exits to the north, east, and west of 
this chamber.

      <desc>The picture on the south wall shows a tiny and dazed-looking wizard 
constantly on the move.  The man is in his late sixties, dressed in a black 
robe, with his hat turned back to front.  He wears an enlarged handkerchief 
instead of a sash and he's paired a dragon-hide boot with a fine 1920's 
style shoe.  He has an unusually thin wand, which he uses to scratch his 
back occasionally.  He keeps turning into a small sparrow and back into a 
human.  A caption beneath the paining says: &quot;Alexander Merlin Caesar 
Dolphungus, Transfiguration Professor at Hogwarts 1911-1925.  Professor 
Dolphungus is the author of many studies on Animagi.  His accident in 1925 
determined his good friend Rudyard Trollope to write upon his tomb: 'Dear, 
often-confused friend.  He only realized too late that being a sparrow in a 
garden full of cats might be dangerous.  Rest in peace!  '&quot;

the sole painting that hangs on the northern wall.  You see exits leading to

    <desc>Wide and inviting, the walls of this hall are decked with hundreds of portraits deep in conversation. Not even one of the portraits is similar in size or shape.  Some of them are as large as a tapestry, while others are no bigger than Tom Riddle's diary. The deafening chatter from the portraits makes the floor rumble. Along the handsome marble floor, there are several spacious area rugs with vibrant, almost gaudy colors. Two large spiral cut shrubs stand guard on either side of this corridors two exits to the west and to the east.

Some resemble non-magical creatures, while others look like a grotesque mix of some very foul things.  Along the walls, between the plaques, is a multitude of round porthole windows that cast spotlights of sun around the area. The floor is a pale white stone with spots of black mold here and there giving the floor a very dirty look. On the east and west ends of this corridor are impressive oak archways.  Each archway is inscribed with the words, &quot;The Beasts of the Dark Forest&quot;, in gothic lettering.

the roof is high and vaulted, causing footsteps to reverberate around this

handsome; his mouth looks serious, but his eyes betray a mischievous 
twinkle.  Wearing a simple tunic, his right hand is outstretched, with wand 
at the ready, while over his left shoulder he carries a small bag, ready for 
a long journey.

walls are high, green hedges, too tall to see the top of.  Floating above is 
a glowing sphere that fills the room with a warm, natural light.  Beside the

gigantic mushroom, as large as a small table.  There are exits to the east, 
west, and south, although the hedges beside the eastern exit have thick,

    <desc>In this unwelcoming compacted hallway, there is little light to distinguish 
the end.  What minute lighting there is, shines dimly through the large, 
red, stained glass windows that proceed to the end of the hall.  Its dreary, 
isolated, and damp.  The gray stone walls outline the depressing suits of 
armor that seem to protect the almost endless hallway.  The battered red rug 
that runs along the stone floor is tattered and fringed.  Some of its 
delicate red and black stitching has frayed.  The ceiling has clear droplets 
of water dripping down.  Some trickle swiftly down the wall to make 
insignificant puddles on the cold floor.  The soothing drops are the only 
eerie noise audible in the hallway.  A slight breeze passes though the 
corridor from the west entrance, and leads to a large threatening archway to 
the east.

    <desc>The most striking feature of this corridor is the large statue in the 
centre.  It depicts a tall, old witch in flowing robes.  Her face is 
wrinkled and wise, and she wears a serene expression on her face.  She has 
sharp grey eyes, the kind that seems to take in everything without looking.  
Her long grey hair hangs loosely from underneath her pointed wizard's hat.  
The corridor which she presides over has a floor and walls made of grey 
stone, the blocks stacked one on top of each other in an orderly pattern.  
Several torches in brackets light up this corridor.  The ceiling is high, 
vaulted, and also made of the grey stone.  There are exits to the east and 
west.

    <name>SECOND DRAFT Moonlit Stairwell</name>
    <copyright>Copyright © 2005  TiaraLi &lt;kenpage@dodo.com.au&gt;</copyright>
    <desc>Silver moonbeams, originating from a suspended orb, slip down the marble 
staircase, and cast an eerie, silver light over the otherwise dark room.  
The floor of this narrow stairwell, like the staircase itself, is a cold, 
white marble, and the walls are wooden panels.  The room is quiet and still, 
except for the occasional howl that comes from the painting on the southern 
wall, filling the room with an evil chill.  The passageway to the north is 
dark and shadowy, while a passage off to the west gives the glimpse of a 
large statue.  A third exit leads down the marble stairs.

      <desc>This painting, in a silver frame, depicts a moonlit scene.  In the 
forefront, at the edge of a dense forest, a middle-aged monk kneels.  His 
grey habit covers a rotund frame, held together at the waist by a simple, 
white rope belt, with three knots in it.  His tonsured head is bare, and 
attracts the light of the full moon.  The monk seems to be having a private 
conversation with a wolf.  Behind them, a break in the trees shows a village 
in a clearing.

    <desc>This room attracts darkness, much like black holes do.  While there are 
three pairs of torches on the eastern wall, their light does not touch the 
centre of the room.  Instead, the faint, warm flicker shows that the 
darkness itself is a cylindrical whirlwind in the middle of the room.  A 
stone path is visible near the walls.  It looks to be the only safe path to 
be taken, in order to avoid the hurricane of darkness.  The flat ceiling is 
low enough to give the impression of a sinister closet.  There are no 
portraits to brighten the atmosphere s or distract one's attention.  Any 
sounds, however distant, are drawn into the darkness that dominates the 
chamber.  The warmth, however, is kept outside, as if it were unholy.  There 
are exits west, south and north of this room.

      <desc>The darkness in this chamber is not static.  In fact, when moving close to 
it, one can feel the slight tug as the hurricane of Nothingness tries to 
absorb anything within its reach.  The stone pathways around it are immune 
to this effect, however.  At the base of the cylinder of darkness, there are 
a few letters written in stone, apparently meditations of a bored student: 
&quot;Much like hatred, Darkness keeps growing.  To be one with the Darkness is 
to keep growing.  T.  M.  Riddle&quot; A reply follows after the signature, 
completing a circle at the base of the Darkness.  The message, in a smoother 
handwriting, reads: &quot;This Darkness cannot stand warmth.  It can be defeated. 
 It grows and it shrinks back in an everlasting prison.  L.  Evans&quot;

    <desc>A brilliant, crystal chandelier hovers above the center of this room.  Its 
many lit candles cast light on the elegant wooden paneling of the walls.  An 
opulent, glittering, gold carpet flows from the north to the south, and 
branches off to another exit to the east.  Against the west wall is the only 
plain object in the room, a simple wooden table.  The table, however, holds 
a single crystal vase, that holds a single flower.  Exits are found to the 
north, east, and south.

a single leg that branches into four small, curved legs about six inches

functional, but the most interesting thing about it seems to be the contents

confused.  One moment a bright, yellow daisy looks out at you; the next, it 
is a solemn, white rose.  It changes again and again, to a discrete tulip, a 
graceful calla lily, and then a shaggy, red bottlebrush.  The flower 
continues changing, though, stopping at each transformation for only a few 
seconds, seemingly never the same flower twice.

corridor.  The large windows are very old, without proper wooden frames, and 
a permanent breeze squeezes through the space between glass and stone.  
During the day, this corridor is illuminated by warm sunlight, while the two 
torches depicted in the two paintings on the north side give out a chilling 
glow after sunset.  The acute absence of any other furniture or sound within 
this corridor is stressed by the large stones lined on the floor.  It looks 
as if even the architect was afraid of the emptiness that simply radiates 
from this chamber, and finished it in a hurry.  There are exits to the south

His gaunt appearance is enhanced by the mane of black hair contrasting with his very pale skin. The fingers of his right hand shiver slightly as they grasp the neck of a small vial. His knuckles and nails look unnaturally dark, as if rotten. He shakes slightly as he fights permanently the urge to drink from the vial. Beneath this portrait there is only a small inscription, written in silver upon black: &quot;The blood of unicorn keeps you alive, but it is a cursed life. You have slain a drop of purity, and so your own soul is claimed instead.&quot;

The woman stares without expression at the hallway, and her eyes do not blink. There is a quiet scream in her being, while her palms press against her upper chest. Her only movements are painful, deep breaths. The small caption beneath her feet reads is written in gold upon red. It reads: &quot;To take a life is to take your own. Whether by despair or by guilt, you suffer more than the one you have killed.&quot;

ancient Greek village.  One can see the agora, stadium, and temples from the 
overhead view this mural offers.  This village must be on the coast, for 
there are sailing ships in the distance.  This mural goes wall to wall, 
reaching right into the corners.  There are exits to the east and west.

    <desc>Blue fills this room in many shades and forms.  A brilliant blue bubble 
floats in the air, as suspended water; it glows, lighting the room with a 
murky blue glow.  The ceiling here glows an eerie blue and it is impossible 
to determine whether it is painted blue or whether it is a white ceiling 
that merely reflects the light from the bubble.  The floor is a blue mosaic, 
made from thousands of tiny gems of every shade of blue imaginable.  The 
walls here have a pale blue background, with every other shade of blue 
sponge painted.  The shades of the walls seem to be organised efficiently, 
with the darkest midnight blue starting at the western exit, and the palest 
sky blue (the shade found closest to the horizon on a sunny day) at the 
eastern exit.  There are three exits here to the west, east, and south.

      <desc>This small bubble, of about 10 inches in diameter, hovers in the air in the 
centre of the room, just out of reach.  It appears to be made of a watery 
liquid and is deep blue in colour.  It occasionally rolls around on its 
axis, bobbing up and down a little, as though it were affected by a slight 
breeze.  Light seems to come from an indiscernible source deep within the 
sphere, lighting the room.

    <desc>At the intersection of four passes, a brass pendulum swings lazily along the perimeter of the white walls forming a circular room. Upon closer examination, the polished glass ball at the end is actually a three-foot wide model of the celestial globe, with the heavenly bodies whirring in their orbits. It is attached to the vaulted ceiling by a long brass tube, and as it sweeps around the room, obsidian dominoes fall to the ground. But after a few seconds, they each rise once more, and this cycle continues for all eternity. To the north, south, east, and west, arched doorways lead to other halls.

    <desc>This north-south corridor is rather pleasant and homey.  A fresh, natural 
breeze wafts through the room, bringing with it the scent of a warm Summer's 
day.  Polished-wood floors and bright yellow wallpapered walls are 
illuminated merrily by candles on either side of the passage.  While the 
floors are clean, they are also worn, as though many students have walked 
this way before.  A painting of a pig hangs, skewed, on the western wall.  
There are exits to the north and south.

      <desc>The painting depicts a typical, farmyard pig rolling about in mud.  Rather 
than squealing happily, it appears morose, as though it were merely passing 
the time.  It looks at you and sighs.  &quot;There were four of us once.  My 
older brothers all decided to go out into the world and build their own 
houses, but as the runt, I was left behind.  I wonder whatever happened to 
them?&quot;

    <desc>The corridor is in need of serious repair.  Crumbling columns hold up a 
fractured, stained ceiling.  Beige paint flakes and chips off of the dented, 
scratched walls.  The floor is bare, with dirt filling the cracks between 
the slabs of rough sandstone.  One small window allows in a little light 
from the cracked, filthy panes.  A rusty bracket holds a sputtering torch, 
which barely lights up the corridor.  There is a rectangular outline on the 
wall of where a painting might have hung as the paint there is less faded 
than the surrounding shade.  There are exits to the north and east.

The cream-coloured woolen carpet has mud tracks through the center of it, as though many careless students have trekked through here.  There is a single painting on the eastern wall, beside an exit.  Exits are to the east and south.

ceiling are made of the rock, which has been cut into many miniscule facets, 
which sparkle in light.  The light scattered from the floor, created by 
candles in nooks in the wall, illuminates small golden veins running through 
the dark, shining stone.  The veins appeared to have run, as small pools of 
gold have formed on the floor.  From one wall protrudes a gigantic gem.  
Pale pink, cloudless, and smooth, the rose coloured stone sits near the 
northern exit.  There is another exit to the west.

    <desc>The hallway is spacious and gently slopes upward. To the north is the door leading nearer the castle's ramparts, and the painting of a noble-born woman-child hangs above. Robed in pale blue, she also bears a wizard hat in the same colour. A series of small circular openings high on the western wall allow the sunlight to pool in white-gold patches on the glossy floorboards. From them, leafy vines probe inside, their tender tips just barely visible when looking up. There is no glass in the windows, and a cool breeze blows through them during summer and winter alike. On the opposite wall, the light patterns also dance. Farther to the east, the hall is extended backwards and downwards.

    <desc>Bleach white walls and slanted ceilings belie the sense of calm that emanates from this corridor. Along the western wall, round windows restore an aura of quiet stability by opening the hallway to light and air. Curling tendrils of ivy cascade from the windows. The floor, made of russet and gold wood, is cushioned by an etched pattern of oak leaves, which rustle softly despite that they are simply carvings on a board. To the north is a small door, and to the south, the same.

    <desc>The foot of the stairs marks the start of a winding granite spiral.  Each 
step is fairly even, although the mortar is chipped and stained between 
individual blocks of stone.  A strip of stone protrudes from the curving 
wall, and it serves as a primitive railing for those dizzied by the height.  
Above the railings, an unidentified liquid has dripped down from the highest 
levels, simultaneously drying into clear streams of lava frozen in time.  
Darkness veils the stairs as they ascend farther up the tower.  A gaping 
trapdoor off to the side opens to the lower levels.  To the south is a plain 
door made of wood from Hogwart's own forests.

    <desc>This large, circular common room exudes a warm and cosy atmosphere.  From 
the large hearths to the soft, thick carpeting underfoot, the whole chamber 
seems to envelop the occupants with a reassuring embrace.  Gold and scarlet 
banners and throws fill the room with proud Gryffindor House colours.  One 
particularly large banner hangs over the round entrance to honour Godric 
Gryffindor, the brave house founder.  A glowing fire crackles by the far 
wall, surrounded by clusters of large, squashy, crimson armchairs.  Tucked 
under the several small, lopsided, oak tables that cover the rest of the 
common room, sit a variety of well-padded, orange stools.  Towards the back 
of the common room are two large, iron-braced oak doors leading up to the 
dormitories.  The door to the north bears the gilded words, &quot;Girls Only&quot;, 
while to the south, a small wooden sign with &quot;Boys&quot; daubed across it hangs 
from the doorknob.

    <desc>Candles along the perimeter of this hexagonal room cast warm hues.  The 
walls are covered with elegant tapestries smothered in dust.  Toward the 
back of the room are several, tall, wooden shelves full of clay objects.  
Pots, pans, cups, plates, figurines, and other clay objects line the 
shelves.  Toward the front of the room is a large metallic oven.  The oven 
gives off an immense amount of heat that will create beautiful pieces of 
artwork.  When the door is opened it reveals liquid clay boiling at the 
bottom of the oven.  Exits are to the north and the south.

    <desc>This is the pinnacle of the great astronomy tower, bared to the ever 
changing sky.  Smooth, wide flagstones cover the entire floor, inlaid with 
thousands of tiny stars made of gold, the lines and arcs of their celestial 
movements inscribed in silver.  The walls of the tower are pitted and 
covered in lichen from centuries of exposure to the elements.  Along the 
parapet stand several weathered oak booths, each with an ornate brass 
telescope and tripod inside, ready to cast a ruinous eye to the heavens.  
The view from the tower is breathtaking, the far reaching grounds of 
Hogwarts lay wide below, serene yet foreboding.  The only exit, for those 
incapable of flight, is down the broad stone stairwell.

    <desc>This level of the tower features a small balcony jutting off the edge of the stairs. A black metal forms its flooring and railings, while wrought iron lilies adorn the corners. In the overhanging eaves, two swallows have plastered together a nest, and their sleek feathers are sparsely strewn on the balcony. Perched on the farthest edge of the wall is an enormous lantern, lit only during the coldest days of winter. The winding staircase continues upwards and downwards.

    <desc>The stairs abruptly end at a stone platform, in a small chamber with barely enough height to accomdate a tall student. A bookshelf at one end of the room is stocked with various sacks, bottles, jars, flasks, and other containers. Otherwise, there is nothing else. The air has a musty scent as there are no windows, and the thick stone walls effectively contain the heat. Next to the bookshelf, a frayed rope ladder dangles from the ceiling, where it then leads to the owlery.

    <desc>The owlery is an extension of the West Tower, its circular walls made of 
stone and broken by three gaps spanning ceiling to floor.  These serve as 
full-length windows for the incoming and departing owls.  Hundreds of them 
perch on weathered beams radiating inward from the walls; they are a mottled 
mural of grey, brown, and black, with the occasional splash of pure white.  
On the floor feathers, droppings, and broken rodent carcasses lie scattered 
in the thick straw bedding.  The straw aids in concealing the sharp odour of 
the room, as well as provide an excuse to leave the owlery untended for 
several days at a time.  The only exit is the trapdoor, with a rope ladder 
leading down to a lower level of the tower.

    <desc>A dark, small room, this broom cupboard holds the Cleansweep five 
broomsticks that Madam Hooch uses for first-year flight lessons.  Although 
nearly always locked, it is kept perfectly clean.  The brooms hang on the 
wall in special, plastic cases.  Boxes containing broom polishers and twigs 
are beneath each case.  Various other tools used in broomcare are placed in 
a large box on the eastern side of the room.  There are no torches inside, 
and the only light source is a small opening on the north side of the room, 
no larger than a Bludger, carefully covered by a window.  Any birds that 
come that way are repelled by an Imperturbable Charm.  The only way out of 
this room is to the south.

      <desc>The brooms, in their plastic cases, line the north wall, with four rows of ten 
brooms each.  They are very well cared-for, but old.  There are scratches on 
some of the handles, and two or three brooms appear to have the end-twigs 
swept off to one side.

      <desc>With a clunking noise, two or three regular brooms jump out of the toolbox on the eastern side of the room. They sweep the room in earnest for a few moments, kicking a small mouse in the process. After the room is cleaned, they jump back into their box and remain still.</desc>

    <desc>Two shawl-covered lamps dimly light the large room.  A medium sized bed sits 
on a brass bedstand in the eastern corner of the room, directly opposing a 
large domed window.  A table is positioned in the middle of the residence, 
and on top of it lies a mistly glass ball.  The wooden walls are covered in 
shelves that hold divination books and other items that are said to help 
unfog the future.  A trunk at the end of the bed is bubbling over with 
shawls, beads, and cloaks in various shades of purple and blue.  A fireplace 
on the south wall remains lit night a day but the incensed smoke that wafts 
from it does not let any light through.

      <desc>The old, battered trunk is a family heirloom, but otherwise isn't worth 
much.  It's only signifying feature is the rather small carving on the top 
that etches out an ornate 'T'.  Moth eaten cloaks and shawls fill it to 
bursting, and on the floor surrounding it are large beaded necklaces.
