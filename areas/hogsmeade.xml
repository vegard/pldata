    <desc>This road follows down a long pathway.  Tall green trees line both sides of 
this dirt covered road and green grass abounds.  Fallen leaves from the 
trees gently cover the ground.  The Hogwarts castle can be seen in the 
distance.  This path continues down to the southwest and back to the east 
are the Gates to Hogwarts.

outlining the human-made trail.  Although there are few trees around, the

    <desc>Trees and bushes decorate the area and their leaves rustle in the cool wind. 
Bushes rustle as animals stir in the presence of humans, especially magical 
ones.  Birds and owls fly overhead and swoop down near the tops of the 
trees.  The path continues on to the northeast and southwest.

    <desc>The trees rustle slightly and many of the smaller animals that occupy this 
area find cover in the bushes around them.  A mother rabbit and her 
younglings cross the path a few yards ahead and birds voice their opinions 
from the treetops above.  The path continues on to the northeast, and the 
southwest.

    <desc>Little green bushes and tall trees occupy the land in this area.  The dusty 
road curves around a large patch of trees then straightens out and goes over 
a small dirt hill.  The usual brightness from the sun during the day is 
dimmed from the clouds in the sky.  From here the road goes down south and 
to the northeast.

    <desc>Upon entering this side of the fork, many large trees and bright green
bushes line the road ahead.  This particular portion of the path is 
friendly and teeming with all kinds of life.  Although many of small
rodents are continuously scurrying across the path, they are content to stay
out of the way of anything bigger than they are; namely Hogwarts students.  
From here, one can travel south to Hogsmeade or north to Hogwarts.

    <desc>. The dirty path forks here.  The road is so dirty that it is nearly 
impossible to tell the branches from each other.  The small path that 
separates them at the very beginning is as full of vegetation as the rest of 
the road.  At the side of the crossroads, there are no houses.  Instead, two 
large oaks guard the path, their heavy branches crooked and twisted almost 
like a person under the Cruciatus Curse.  The two roads lead to the north 
and to the northwest, while the main roads in Hogsmeade are to the south and 
Hogwarts to the north.

    <desc>This dirt road breaks off from the path leading to both Hogwarts and 
Hogsmeade.  Green grass grows outside of the dirt lane and the sun blazes in 
the blue sky during the day if it is not stormy weather.  During the night, 
however, the moon casts a dark blue shadow encompassing the area.  On both 
sides of the lane are tall willow trees that give some cool shade, 
contrasting the warm air in the spring and summer time.  Willow Lane 
continues on to the northwest while going southeast leads back to the road 
to Hogsmeade and Hogwarts.

    <desc>. Large Oak trees surround the path.  Their branches hang over the trail like 
the claws of some unearthly creature.  They're filled with all sorts of 
animals and birds that watch as people pass their homes.  Their eyes glow 
from within holes and cracks in the elderly trees.  The path underneath is 
hard packed dirt and is very much traveled by the looks of it.  There are 
many foot prints and shoe marks lining the whole width of the path. The 
trail leads on north toward Hogwarts, and southwest to Hogsmeade.

    <desc>This dirt lane homes a surfeit amount of tall willow trees.  In one of the 
farther off trees a family of birds is nesting.  They are mostly hidden from 
view by the leaves and branches of the tree.  The sun shines on the green 
grass during the day when its not stormy and there are plenty of large rocks 
to sit on throughout the area.  This lane continues on to the northwest and 
to the southeast is where this lane breaks off from the road to Hogwarts and 
Hogsmeade.

small wooden sign flashes &quot;Nutshell Lane,&quot; in gold writing in the light.  To

 The oaks that surround this place look welcoming and elderly.  Southwest

    <desc>The air in this part of the road is thick with the smell of elderly oaks and 
younger pine trees.  Nutshell Lane goes through what looks to be a man-made 
clearing in the midst of a large group of trees.  There is almost no light 
here, but the atmosphere is peaceful and friendly.  Patches of grass grow 
wildly on the road, surrounded by stones of different sizes and shapes.  
Just by the roadside, there are a couple of trees bearing markings on their 
elderly barks.  To the east, this road meets the main path that leads to 
central Hogsmeade, while to the west, the clearing opens into a small, wild 
garden.

      <desc>The trees here exhibit large cuts on their barks.  One can easily 
distinguish claw marks, probably belonging to a very large dog, and just 
above there are marks certainly made by stag horns.  A few other scratches, 
much deeper than these, are drawn into a particularly large oak.  A few of 
the Hogsmeade boys tell the story that their fathers were nearly attacked by 
a werewolf when they were young.  Apparently those deep marks are his.  They 
also say that the werewolf was only chased away by a large, black dog that 
looked like a Grim.

    <desc>Beautiful roses, violets, and daisies line the roadside here, a well-tended 
compliment to the gold and purple house that rises in the west.  The flowers 
surround a wooden fence that circles the front lawn of the home, and their 
unbroken wave of color gives a regal air to the stone path that leads up to 
the front door.  As for the dirt road below, it is covered in boot prints 
and tiny stones yet manages to stay clean and organized in accordance with 
the orderly homes and gardens that surround it.  Off to the east, an 
impressive array of wild trees and flowers hides a distant cottage, while 
the sounds of a brook flow melodiously out of their midst.  The dirt path 
continues south, into Hogsmeade proper, north, towards more homes and, 
eventually, Hogwarts, and east, to the wild garden and cottage.

A chimney rises from the left side of the roof, while a violet gable watches the lawn from the right side.

    <desc>From the very first step inside, this cottage becomes rather dark, 
irrespective of the weather outside.  Curtains made of willow branches and 
ivy lazily and gracefully bend across a few dark windows.  Carefully-tended 
carpets made of moss invite the guests to walk barefoot.  Decorations made 
of rose petals intertwined in ferny, have been hung on the wall, held there 
by what appears to be grey human hair of unusual virility.  A few squirrels 
prowl around the house, entering and exiting through an ingenious hole about 
two feet above the ground.  Empty nutshells are scattered everywhere across 
the cottage floor.  The entrance lies to the east.

    <desc>The path has flowers beginning to grow from it sides.  By not growing in the 
middle of the road, the flowers stay away from the dangers of human feet, 
but they seem to grow prettily in the grass around.  One can see little 
cottages beginning to arise in the distance, showing that the little village 
is not to far away.  The path leads northeast towards Hogwarts and southwest 
to the village.

great number of willow trees occupy the land, offering a place for birds to 
nest.  Healthy green grass spreads between the trees.  Flowers and small 
bushes have grown sporadically, making the area look full of life.  This 
lane continues on to the southeast.  To the west at the end of the lane are 
a small cottage and a garden.

    <desc>The road here turns south, to avoid the front gardens of the Hogsmeade 
houses.  The wobbly path is cleaner here, with patches of red, blue and 
white flowers alongside it.  To the right side of this part of the road, 
there is a garden with a serpentine pebble-path leading to a doorway, amidst 
explosions of red and white rose-bushes.  The house itself is painted white, 
with a solid-mahogany door.  On the left side, a straight, paved lane 
separates a meadow, with low grass, and eyes of red and blue flowers.  This 
house looks very similar to the one opposite it.  The windows, however, have 
white frames, instead of dark brown ones.  The road continues to the south 
and to the northeast.

On either side of the path willow trees line the road creating a very

more trees.

is a snicket, overgrown with privet hedges.

    <desc>There are occasional flowers on the roadside here.  The path shows marks of 
recent cleaning, although there are occasional bird droppings and dirt piles 
on the road.  The wind is very strong in this area, and it often happens 
that clouds of dust and tiny particles are lifted from the ground, and 
forced to cyclone to the left or to the right, more often than not returning 
to their original location.  On the northeastern side of the path, there are 
a couple of very old, knobbly trees.  The path runs from the northwest to the 
southeast, with a branch on the western side.

    <desc>On this dirt road lies a sweet old cottage with a lovely front garden.  The 
bright and cheerful garden consists of all types of flowers; red and yellow 
roses, daisies, orange wild flowers, white geraniums, and purple tulips, all 
lined neatly in front and behind of a small, white picket fence.  Tall thin 
blades of green grass bend with the gentle breeze and add contrast to the 
flowers.  A large oak tree and a large willow tree on the east side of the 
garden provide plenty of shade.  On the west side butting up against the 
side of the house is a small vegetable garden.  Planted there are tomatoes, 
cucumbers, carrots, and radishes.  The entire front garden is very well kept 
and healthy looking.  To the east is Willow Lane and to the west is the 
Willow Cottage.

    <desc>Behind the flower garden and white picket fence is a lovely light brown 
coloured cottage.  It is covered entirely with dark green vines and has a 
dark brown roof with a chimney on the west side.  Small windows in the front 
have light blue curtains and happily let the sun shine through them.  
Directly in front of the door is a light blue rug that reads, &quot;Welcome.&quot;  
Just inside the cottage to the west is a mirror hanging from the light blue 
coloured walls.  Below it is a wooden decorative table with a white doily 
and a vase full of flowers.  The floor in this area is wooden as well.  The 
whole house is lit by lanterns on the walls.  The tiled kitchen is to the 
east.  An oval wooden table with chairs is placed to the side with widows 
circling one side of them.  Tucked away in the far back west corner of the 
cottage lies the carpeted bedroom.  The only exit is to the east, the Willow 
Cottage Garden.

      <desc>The carpet here is brown and soft and the walls are painted with a dark 
blue.  A wooden dresser stands in the east corner covered haphazardly with 
clothes.  The bed is also covered in clothes.  Wooden French double doors 
with white curtains lead outside to the back of the cottage.

    <desc>The air here is peaceful and filled with the sweet scents that signify there 
is a garden nearby.  The path goes beneath a succession of tall, stern oaks, 
which have obviously been tended to.  They are so impressive and grand that 
it often drives one to breathlessness.  The road is also taken care of, thus 
there are no holes in it and all bird droppings vanish a few times a day.  
The road runs from the main Hogsmeade path, which is on the east side, to a 
more private branch of it, to the west.

    <desc>This beautiful garden borders the large group of trees that crowds around 
Nutshell Lane.  A hedge, about half the size of a grown man, separates the 
Mole End Garden from its surroundings.  Many thickets of perfumed, wild 
roses grow sheltered by this hedge, like drops of a very powerful and 
passionate love potion.  Strong oaks and sturdy pine trees have grown tall 
and old in this garden, undamaged by human hands.  Streams of clear water, 
with bunches of white, pink, and blue flowers on their banks, criss-cross 
through the labyrinth of green freshness.  A small, arched door, made of 
ivy-covered wood leads out of the garden to the east.  To the west, the 
garden leads to a small terrace and into a cottage.

      <desc>The little house, made entirely of oak, has an arched entrance, with a 
little, diamond-shaped window placed at about the height of a man.  A small 
sign above the door spells, in letters made of pine twigs: &quot;Mole End.&quot;  
There are two visible windows, on either side of the entrance.  Small pots 
of wild, scarlet-coloured flowers have been placed underneath these windows. 
 Ivy stretches across the wooden surface of the walls in beautiful patterns 
that suggest freedom and youth.

are completely white, and the room has a marble floor.  The dishes and the 
expensive china are placed in separate wooden cupboards above three stoves 
placed next to one another.  A clean sink is set against the wall, beneath a 
small window, which, nevertheless, allows in plenty of light.  A vegetable 
basket is placed next to the kitchen door on the north side.  Five mops lean 
against the southern wall, beside a large, dark-brown dustbin.  There are 
two small chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, which light automatically at 
sunset.  A small, wooden door leads west, to the house-elves' quarters.  The 
northern doorway leads into the antechamber of the Raven Lodge.

sunlight and is covered with twigs and leaves from the tree above.  A small 
patch of orange fungus is clustered around the base of the tree's trunk.  
The road continues to the northwest and southeast.

    <desc>A deep ditch runs parallel to the dirt path.  Someone seems to have tended 
to this pathway some time ago by lining either side roughly with large 
stones to prevent accidents.  Weeds grow thickly between the stones, some of 
which have rolled to the middle of the path and are now embedded in the 
solid dirt.  A group of tiny flies buzz around frantically to the east.  The 
path continues to the south and the northwest.

Running parallel to the dirt path is a stream. The trees that grow here are small and thin, about eight feet high. Barely visible through the trees is a group of cenataurs talking. The path is windy, and it is difficult to see far ahead.

The dirt on this path is littered with rocks. There is a ditch to the left side. To the right there is a large pile of fertilizer. There are very few trees here; instead, there are just bare patches of dirt. The trail is not very long, though it is hard to walk because the rocks make it difficult to walk through. The only two exits are northeast and southwest.

 Large tiger trees overshadow the path. Surrounding the largest tree is a beautiful bouquet of white roses. The whole path is lined with white flowers: lilies, daises, roses, and tulips. The path is covered with flower petals and looks as though a flower girl came down here and threw her petals everywhere. The exits are northeast and southwest.

    <desc>. Trees with dense foliage line either side of this walkway covering the 
entire path in shadow.  The ground is slightly damp and small puddles of dew 
or rainwater have collected here and there.  The path is covered with a 
mixture of twigs, rotting leaves, bird droppings, and owl pellets.  It 
smells dank and rotten.  When a breeze blows through the trees, the leaves 
rustle loudly making the wind sound more powerful than it is.  In a small 
gap between the trees, the path branches out to the east as well as 
continuing on to the northeast and southwest.

    <desc>The dirt path branches here to the east, where a single, desolate, little 
road creeps to the most haunted place in Britain - the Shrieking Shack.  
This section of the Hogsmeade road is very dirty, and it looks as though 
nobody has ever tried to clean it before.  Twigs and leaves are buried 
amongst dirt and bird droppings, and wild bushes grow at the northwestern 
side of the road.

dusty, and small clouds of the dust have formed over the path.  The 
vegetation grows thick and wild, with dense clumps of brush growing along 
the path.  Creeping plants spill over onto the path, their arms reaching 
towards the other side in vain.  The path continues on the southeast, and
the dirt path to Hogsmeade is to the west.

The path has distinctive markings on either side, which look like someone probably tried to drag a plow down it. To the left there is a brown, wooden fence and behind the fence there is a large, open field. To the right there is a lot of over-grown shrubbery. A tree, split in half by lightening, sits to the far right. There are no visible animals. The path leads northeast and southwest.

    <desc>Clear of twigs and branches, the dirt path swerves like a drunken man 
underneath the boughs of thick trees.  Patches of grass and, in season, 
occasional white flowers smile at passers-by from amidst rose bushes.  
Trickling into the air is the scent of wilderness, thick and overwhelmingly 
fresh, accompanied by a slight sweet perfume.  Small blades of grass edge 
their way tentatively onto the trail, their tiny foreheads raised towards 
the sky.  To the southwest, a tidy lane leads into the High Street, while to 
the northeast lies the way towards habitable Hogsmeade.

      <desc>The peaceful linden trees bend heavily above the path, their heavily-laden 
arms protectively stretching above thorny rose bushes.  Their trunks are 
scarred by time and old age, but their strength is nevertheless visible and 
reassuring.  Residing amongst the innumerable, long branches are tiny bird 
nests.  The constant rustling of leaves, irrespective of the wind, is 
magically soothing.

    <desc>The dusty path transforms into a lovely paved road here, paved with 
white-grey stones veined with viridian and cream.  The street is no longer 
lined with brush and weeds; the area is kept very clean and small, simple 
flower boxes line the sides of the street, along with short, wispy trees.  A 
tall lamppost, topped with a lantern, rises up on both sides of the street.  
To the Northeast the dirt path starts again, and to the Southwest the High 
Street continues.

    <desc>The dirt path broadens here towards a beautiful, wild garden.  The shadow of 
a cottage is barely visible behind this paradise of ivy, moss, and pine 
trees.  The path has been as well-tended as the garden itself.  There are no 
bird-droppings on this lane and white flowers have been planted at the sides 
of the road.  At every few feet, tall pine trees rise above the path, their 
fresh scent thick in the gentle breeze.  The gate to the wild garden on the 
east side is made of light wood, which creaks every now and again with the 
wind. The road continues west for a while before joining the main path that 
leads to central Hogsmeade.

Northeast.  Westwards lies a dimly lit stretch of road, silent and ominous.  
A tall lamppost topped with a lantern rises up on both sides of the street.  
Thin, wispy trees march alongside the street, as do tidy flower boxes full 
of flowery promise.

    <desc>Tall pine trees tower over a little garden in front of a large cottage.  Ivy 
creeps across the ground below, curving among mossy rocks and roots.  The 
rolling, curving ground is covered in rocks and moss.  Some of these rocks 
define a circular clearing in the garden where several logs have been placed 
as benches.  The soft trickle of a stream floats from the side of the 
garden, where a rivulet of water flows through smooth, round stones.  Along 
the bank small white flowers bloom.  Their fallen petals coat the ground 
like a field of snow.  The same flowers line the path that travels to the 
cottage.  The cottage is to the northeast and the road is to the west.

    <desc>Upon entering this large room, the scent of warm cheese lingers in the air 
as its cause sits neatly all over the room.  The inside walls are lined with 
thick wood and a finished coat of varnish that blends in with the dark oak 
roof which supports the higher level of the cottage.  The walls hold many 
pictures of cheese, foreign cheese, local cheese, and smelly cheese, every 
cheese one could possibly think of.  Towards the back of the shop, a large 
oak counter sits firmly attached to the floor with its glass casing.  
Several types of prime cheeses sit in the case, small chunks missing from 
the various kinds.  The floor is also a varnished oak, matching with the 
roof and counter it blends nicely with the soft, woolen rug that sits in the 
middle of the room.  Upon the rug, a round table sits with a pile of cheese 
stacked up onto each other in a pyramid shape.  Several other shelves and 
stands are placed around the room in different locations, each holding a 
wide range of cheese and even a 'Cheese it yourself: Pik 'n' Mix' stand.

    <desc>A slanting, wooden roof, held up by stocky, oak beams, towers above stand 
upon stand of groceries.  The shop, although rather large, seems cramped and 
claustrophobically-small, with every inch of it filled with merchandise 
except for a narrow lane between the various shelves, clearly destined for 
people to walk on.  Made of reddish-brown wood and nearly invisible behind a 
wallpaper of various items, the floor and walls are smooth and very clean.  
A sturdy counter occupies the eastern side of the store, its surface 
half-covered in pots and jars filled with different sorts of candy that is 
undoubtedly meant for the younger generation of customers.  Vegetables and 
fruit occupy the southwestern corner of the shop, grouped next to various 
ingredients usable for cooking.  Household items, from the simplest table to 
Ever-Rocking, Self-Cleaning chairs, crowd against the north wall.  A wooden 
door, with a small window, stands to the south.

      <desc>These large chairs are made from various kinds of wood, ranging from oak to 
ebony, their shapes carefully-chiselled to imitate a relaxed, human form.  
Some exhibit cushions or even small mattresses, for a comfortable sleep.  
Although quite still while nobody is sitting on them, the slightest pull or 
tug sends them into a gentle rocking motion on their beautifully-curved 
legs.  Dust may pile around them, but some manner of charm drives it away 
from the chairs.

    <desc>This cottage is a paradise for anybody seeking entertainment.  The 
floorboards emit green fumes when stepped on, some changing into geese and 
chickens.  The ceiling is nearly invisible due to the numerous enchanted 
walking sticks, exploding curtains, and bogey-spitting musical instruments.  
There are Frisbees whizzing through the air, causing twisted, ugly-looking 
instruments to lash out menacingly when a flying device gets too near.  An 
entire corner has been dedicated to hosting a vast collection of vicious, 
quarreling, snapping broomsticks of different sizes.  A few brooms lie on 
the floor, completely broken and battered.  The walls are lined with open, 
inviting cupboards, filled with delicious-looking cookies and chocolates.  A 
couple of non-stop exploding cookies are kept in heat-resistant, rectangular 
glass containers.  The entrance to this cottage lies to the north.

    <desc>This rather large cottage is made entirely of long wooden logs.  Outside the 
cottage lie moss-covered rocks.  Small rectangular windows are cut into the 
four side of the cottage allowing the beautiful sunshine to pour in during 
bright, storm-free days.  The floor and walls inside the cottage are wooden. 
 Near the entrance on the east wall is a painting.  To the north is the 
sitting room with a large, wooden, circular table with six wooden chairs.  
To the east is the kitchen complete with a small, wooden table for two and a 
vase of fresh flowers in the middle of the table.  The bedroom is in the 
west corner of the cottage and is very friendly with a happy shade of yellow 
painted onto the walls.  The only exit is to the garden to the southwest.

assorted colours everywhere, from the brightest pink to very dark mauve.  A 
low, light-brown, wooden fence surrounds the garden on three sides, and just 
opposite the Kiln cottage entrance, there is a small gate.  The cobblestone 
path between the Kiln cottage and the gate passes by beautiful stone 
arrangements that curl artistically and end in a coiled pattern.  These 
alleyways surround patches of flowers tastefully grouped, from the whitest 
daffodils to blood-red roses.  The entrance to the Kiln cottage lies to the 
west and the path outside the garden gate runs northeast.

    <desc>The clean street is made of white, round cobblestones, which, although 
chipped around the edges, are clean of weeds and moss.  The way is narrow, 
but cosy, bordered on both sides by three foot high, stone walls, embraced 
tightly by thick vines.  A few small, white flowers smile at the edges of 
the path, spreading tentative, sweet scents in the fresh air.  Insects of 
all sorts fill the sky with a continuous, warm buzzing, while happy, little 
birds chatter busily as they fly past.  To the north lies the luminous High 
Street of Hogsmeade.  By contrast, the southern road becomes increasingly 
darker as it goes on towards the end of the small alley.

      <desc>Time and a few unfriendly hexes have scarred the surfaces of these walls in 
dark, angry trails, which contrast deeply with the general cleanness of the 
dark-grey stone.  Vines peek from over their rounded tops, having already 
begun to stretch downwards in intricate models as curled as Middle-Aged 
writing.

    <desc>Upon entrance to this store one is greeted with the sights, sounds, and 
smells common to a wizarding joke shop.  A large case placed quite near the 
door shows off a mountainous pile of dungbombs.  The smell wafting from this 
mound fills the shop with an extremely unpleasant scent.  Among the rows and 
rows of gags, one shelf appears to be emitting green smoke while sparks are 
regularly given off by a shiny contraption, about two feet high, at the back 
of the store.  Hanging from hooks in the ceiling are trick items of all 
shapes and sizes.  A series of pointy devices, gradually increasing in size, 
are lined up with some teacups.  At the back of the shop, next to the 
sparking contraption, sits a counter painted with zany stripes of 
alternating black and neon colours.  The exit of this shop is to the south.

Simple flower boxes line the sides of the street, along with short, wispy 
trees.  A tall lamppost, topped with a lantern, rises up on both sides of 
the way.  The colourful storefront of Zonko's Joke Shop can be seen to the 
North.  To the South is an open field.  The High Street stretches both 
Northwest and Southeast.

    <desc>The dirt path branches at this point in two directions.  To the northwest, 
the path continues for a while, until it dies at the gates of a large 
garden, which lies before an impressive house.  To the southwest, a 
miniature garden is spread before a little cottage.  Both gardens are very 
beautiful, and there is a similarity between the houses, both exhibiting a 
sort of sternness.  Though the view is magnificent, the aura emanated from 
these two places is cold.  The main Hogsmeade path lies to the east.

    <desc>The dirt path is well-tended here, free of the usual twigs and mud-piles.  
It broadens to allow a beautiful view of a spectacular garden.  Patches of 
colour mingle everywhere, giving out the warm, vivid feeling of life.  There 
are trees every now and again watching over the handsome garden, their 
intense green contrasting with the fresh grass.  Behind the garden, the 
large house towers over the road, its walls old and painted red.  There are 
over twenty windows visible from this portion of the road, as well as the 
top of a large, wooden door.

    <desc>The marvelous garden before this Lodge is surrounded by a high, black, metal 
fence.  The fence is made up of spikes, with mace-like tops, united by two 
inward-curved, thin arches.  The two gates are made in similar fashion, 
except that the tall pillars, at the hinges, have a lion head on the mace 
tops.  A cobblestone path serpentines between the gates and the large house. 
 There is a small lake on the northern side.  Wild trees and weeds are 
allowed to gracefully ornate its edges.  Willows bow their heads over the 
water, some even brushing the surface with long, thin plaits.  Towards the 
gates, exotic orchids and roses stretch towards the sun, surrounded by small 
patches of strong oaks.  The southern side of the garden comprises a 
collection of all sorts of flowers, blooming in vivid, healthy colours.  
Some gnomes are visible in the thicker shrubberies, occasionally chased by 
one of the many cats that seemed to have found their home here.  Towards the 
house, the flora diminishes gradually until it reaches a large, stone porch, 
before the wooden doors of the Lodge.  The Lodge lies to the west of the 
garden, while the gates are to the southeast.

      <desc>A garden gnome chuckles as a cat chases it across the cobblestone path. The cat is a British Shorthair, with a blue coat. Its tail slashes the air as it chases the small creature. Finally, the gnome dives into a hole in the ground, by the root of a large oak tree. The cat tries to delicately insert a paw through the hole, but with no success. Annoyed, it decides to wait a nearby, hidden in the tall grass, tail swishing in increasing anger.

    <desc>Built on a parallel lane to the Raven Lodge, this cottage was generally used 
by their gardeners.  The Kiln family is now in charge of the Administration 
of the Lodge.  Their home is rather comfortable, with walls fully covered by 
reddish-brown wood.  The cottage is modest, but gives an overall feeling of 
warmth and love.  From the few portraits in the house, the Kiln family are a 
severe-looking couple, with a thoroughly-magical background.  Previous 
photographs show their son playing for the Chudley Cannons Quidditch team.  
The entrance into this cottage lies to the east.

    <desc>A cobblestone path runs from the door of the Raven Lodge to their Guest 
House.  On both sides of the small road, there is short, vivid-green grass, 
leading into the well-tended garden.  The cobblestone path runs parallel to 
the dining-room of the Raven Lodge, and ends before the wooden threshold of 
the Guest House.  Through the large windows, a large, wooden table can be 
seen in the Lodge dining-room.  The Guest House, although much less 
impressive-looking than the Lodge, is more private, with smaller windows, 
often in oval shapes.  Most curtains are drawn.

    <desc>This tidy, little chamber appears more suitable for an attic than for a 
ground-floor room.  It has five separate little beds, suitable for 
house-elves, beside which there are tiny night tables and hangers for 
elf-sized uniforms.  A heatless, blue globe placed in the centre of the 
chamber, underneath the ceiling, provides a stern, distant light to the 
entire chamber.  To the northern side of the room, there are several 
wine-racks placed against the wall.  This room is kept pleasantly cool 
throughout the year.  The only door out of this room is to the east, leading 
to the kitchen.

      <desc>The wine-racks in this chamber are made of strong oak.  There is wine 
ranging from one to a hundred years of age.  Each rack contains ten rows of 
twenty bottles.  The first two racks contain red wine, the middle one, rose 
wine, and the last two, white wine.

    <desc>The dining room is rather large, its wooden floors covered by soft, brown 
carpets.  The peaceful white of the walls meets brown wood about halfway 
down.  The combination is, peaceful, giving a sense of refinement and old 
age.  There is a wooden table in the centre of the room, which is long 
enough to seat fifty people.  The chairs are all made from the same 
expensive, dark wood, with dark-blue velvet cushions.  On both sides of the 
room, beneath the ceiling, the Ravenclaw shield seems to be guarding the 
Master and Mistress of the house.  Light pours in generously through the 
large windows, which are framed by very thick, dark-blue curtains.  There is 
a high, wooden door leading west into the living-room, and a similar one 
north, towards a small study.

      <desc>The Ravenclaw shield is depicted just beneath the ceiling, on both sides of 
the dining room.  It represents a spread-winged and spread-legged raven, 
carrying a wand in its right claw and a sceptre in the left.  The raven's 
eyes any light, but do not reflect it back, as if made from very dense, 
coal-black stones.

    <desc>Both the living and the dining room have doors leading into this small, 
rather elegant study.  Everything here is made of expensive wood.  There are 
a few bookcases on the west side of the room, containing books about charms 
enchantments, and curses.  There is a small, arched window on the south 
wall, just above a wooden desk.  The desk is clean, with the exception of 
the necessary tools for writing letters.  A collection of handsome 
eagle-feather quills lie ready on the right and on the left of the table, 
with ink bottles to accompany them.  A single roll of blank parchment awaits 
the next writer.  A small side-cupboard next to the bookcases contains 
Firewhiskey and Sherry.  A large chandelier is hanging from the ceiling.

    <desc>. Continuing Northwest and Southeast, the white stoned High Street stretches 
forth like a pale stony ribbon.  Small, thatch roofed buildings dot either 
side of the lane and simple flower boxes line the sides of the street, along 
with short, wispy trees.  Beyond the buildings are large grass fields dotted 
with trees and small streams.  A tall lamppost, topped with a lantern, rises 
up on both sides of the avenue.  Holly Avenue begins to the North.

for the cottage that lies to the east.  In its graceful boughs, 
sweet-throated birds sing.  At its feet grows a nightshade bush, heavy with 
dark crimson blossoms. The humble door of Dayflower Cottage lies to the 
east. Holly Avenue stretches northwards, while to the south lies the High

    <desc>The paved walk is covered with smooth, small stones varying in different 
sizes across its tamed placing.  It is worn by the soles of those who walk 
through the street, in and out within Hogsmeade making the floor adapt to 
its constant tread and scuffle.  It runs down towards the West in a carried, 
straight walk which softens the eastern way showing an angled release from 
the surrounding structures.  Two buildings stand towering over the path, a 
shop and a cottage, filling in for the passed trees that usually line across 
the weathered path.  North and South, they both sit idling in the 
encompassed area that one finds themself within.

The room is small considering it is the only hospital for miles. The walls are a deep green and the floor is white. Along the far wall there are curtains sectioning off bed spaces. Opposite the door (which leads south to High Street) is an oak secretary's desk.  Every few feet glowing, green bulbs hang from the ceiling.

    <desc>. This circular cottage's space is comfortable, but confined.  Two clear, 
glass windows surround both sides of the door.  A stone fireplace, matching 
the stone floor and walls, resides on the southern wall opposite the 
entrance.  A small bed is placed on the west wall, with a pillow, and red 
linen sheets.  A mahogany table takes up the centre of the room, along with 
a pair chairs on each side of it.  On the wall, opposite the bed, a small, 
simple, wooden desk sits.  Standing south of the desk is a wooden dresser 
with three drawers, each affixed with a brass knob.  A dark wooden door 
stands to the north.

    <desc>The door between the dining room and the living room is made from brown 
wood, with doorknobs representing a raven with spread wings.  The living 
room is smallish, with a few comfortable armchairs placed in small groups 
around the large, wooden fireplace.  Upon a small mantelpiece, there are a 
few ornaments made from black onyxes.  A single portrait is hanging above 
the fireplace, representing Rowena Ravenclaw in her youth.  Opposite this 
portrait, there are two wooden bookcases, containing mostly books about 
Heraldic.  Next to the eastern-most bookcase, there is high, wooden door, 
leading northeast into a small study.

      <desc>The painting shows Rowena Ravenclaw, one of the four founders of Hogwarts, 
in her youth.  The stern-looking, intelligent witch is represented at a 
Ball, wearing an elegant, dark-blue, strapless dress.  She is young and 
shining, smiling mysteriously.  Her dark hair is brought out by the 
beautiful silver necklace she wears.  At the end of this necklace, there is 
a single, black onyx, the size of a small egg.  The Rowena Ravenclaw in the 
portrait curtseys gracefully to all who enter the room, but her eyes remain 
proud and distant.

    <desc>This house only has one floor.  The dark-brown wood furnishing in the Lodge 
is here replaced by ebony.  The carpet is royal blue, and the ceiling is 
white, with a black chandelier hanging over the centre of the small chamber. 
 There is a large bed made of ebony along the northern wall.  There are no 
paintings or portraits on the walls, and there are only a few books inside, 
placed in a single shelf at the side of the bed.  These books are novels of 
all genres, written by the most famous of the Wizarding writers.  The 
entrance to this Guest House is on the south side.

    <desc>The road runs in between the buildings of this small portion of Hogsmeade, a 
delicate area that house a few shops and cottages which fills the village 
itself.  The High Street, weathered and worn, is led east and west as it 
carries off into other parts of Hogsmeade.  Across the edges of the road, 
even smaller and less visual walks lead into a pair of buildings, one North 
and one South.  To the North is a cottage and the South presents a shop.  
The stones that form the ground are smooth and level with tiny gaps in 
between each piece, full of dirt and dust.  A large oak sign hangs over the 
southern shop door.  The shop's window holds a full display different items.

    <desc>This chamber looks like a wide corridor, with portraits on all walls, 
representing a large variety of people.  A large candelabrum is hanging in 
the middle of the chamber, spreading just the right amount of light to make 
the portraits appear vivid.  There are about fifteen teenagers in Hogwarts 
uniforms, most of them in Ravenclaw, but a couple in Slytherin and 
Gtyffindor, too.  There are portraits of beautiful ladies in dress robes or 
Muggle evening gowns, and there are men of varying ages in dark clothing.  
Most of them are portrayed standing and smiling, but a few at the end are 
shown performing magic, usually levitation charms.  There are doors towards 
the ends of the hallway, to the north, to the south, and to the southwest, 
but also between the portraits, to the west.

    <desc>As one stands in this meek single-room cottage, one finds him or herself in 
a light stable room. Against the western wall shelves are set against the 
stained wood, small bottles and boxes of necessities arranged there 
carefully.  The homely looking bed tucked in the northwestern corner of the 
room, a beautiful, feminine blanket draped over the mattress and covering 
the plain white pillow. Set into the eastern wall is a quaint fireplace, 
small figurines smile their porcelain smiles set atop the mantle.  The small 
round table set close to the center of the room is draped in a embroidered 
tablecloth, the matching wooden chairs arranged snugly around it.  Turning 
back to the southern wall the door invites it's owner to open it, leading to 
the path beyond.

    <desc>The library is a circular chamber with no windows.  The walls are covered in 
circular bookcases and there are a few round tables with corresponding 
armchairs in the northeastern, northwestern, southeastern, and southwestern 
sides of the room.  A thin, golden rug is placed between the eastern and the 
southern door, on top of the already-existent dark-blue, soft carpet.  The 
library contains books of all ages and covering most subjects.  There is, 
however, nothing to be found about the Dark Arts.  The bookcases being so 
high, levitation is needed to reach the upper shelves.  The only light in 
this chamber comes from diamond-shaped groups of onyxes of different colours 
hanging in mid-air above the tables.  The warm rays of light that they 
spread are good enough for reading and writing.

    <desc>This chamber has walls wholly covered in wood, with a white ceiling and 
certainly belongs to a boy.  The large chandelier hanging from the ceiling 
has small, stubby, dark-blue, radish-shaped candles.  There is a wardrobe 
with double doors in the northwestern corner of the room.  A rectangular 
mirror is placed on the westernmost door.  The boy's bed occupies the 
western side of the room, and it is made of black metal.  Underneath the 
windows on the southern side, there is a desk, with three drawers.  The 
table-top is clean.  A brown armchair has been placed by the desk.  In the 
small bookcase next to this desk, there are old school books, ranging from 
the first-year level to the Ordinary Wizarding Level.  There are also a few 
Quidditch-related books.

    <desc>This bedroom clearly belongs to the Master and Mistress of the house.  The 
walls of this chamber are made of wood on the bottom half and white on their 
upper half.  The ceiling is also white, with a golden chandelier hanging 
above the middle of the room.  A large, wooden wardrobe covers the eastern 
wall entirely.  The Venetian mirror on its northernmost door has a 
spread-winged eagle above it.  Just above the point where the wooden 
covering is replaced by white paint on the northern wall, there are two 
large, oval-shaped portraits of the current owners of the house.  Beneath 
these portraits, there is a dark-brown, wooden double bed, with a dark-blue 
blanket covering it.  Beneath the large windows on the western wall, there 
is a night table, with a book entitled 'Into the Werewolf's Dream' on it.  A 
hairbrush and two small bottles of perfume are placed next to the book.

      <desc>The two oval-shaped portraits are placed in a sort of gigantic medallion.  
Mr.  Raven is painted as a dashing, stern, young man with jet-black hair.  
His hair is slightly grey above the ears, which makes him look noble and 
distinguished.  He has passionate, brown, clever eyes and thin lips.  His 
nose is straight and not too long, and he has a strong chin.  His skin is 
pale, almost pallid, contrasting beautifully with his black hair.  To the 
left side of this picture, there is another, representing a woman in her 
mid-twenties.  Her hair is auburn and very smooth, caught up in an elegant 
bun.  Her eyes are deep-green and languorous, and she smiles with full, red 
lips.  Her smile is understanding and wise beyond her age.  A silver 
necklace with a large onyx stone at the end falls over her chest.  Both 
portraits look quite old.  The two people in them simply nod and smile.

      <desc>The book on the night table is about four hundred pages long.  Its covers 
are made of leather, with an illustration of a half wolf, half man character 
howling at a full moon.  Its author is called Alistair Bones.  A small 
caption on the back reads: &quot;The werewolf waited, its ears perched high, 
awaiting its prey.  Its breathing was deep and quiet, and he endured 
silently the biting cold that ruffled through its thin coat.  The woman was 
coming towards him, whistling unconcernedly, a small bundle held in her 
arms.  The tantalizing pounding of fresh blood deafened the werewolf.  His 
breathing broke into a tense panting.  Then suddenly it pounced.&quot;  Written 
in golden letters underneath this passage, there is another line: &quot;'Once 
more, Alistair Bones has shown that he is, irrevocably, a master of his 
genre.  ' - The Daily Prophet&quot;.

    <desc>. The street is surrounded by a set of structures; made from cottages and 
shops they burrow the path in a wall like manner.  The tree lined street is 
clean swept and free of any litter or debris.  Worn stones line the way 
showing the marking of heavy use.  A tall lamppost, topped with a lantern, 
rises up on both sides of the street, and simple flower boxes border the 
street on both sides.  There is a shop to the North with a large window at 
its front and a wooden door beside it, a sign posted just over the top.  The 
shop is like most the cottages around Hogsmeade with a thatched roof and an 
aged look to it.  A fork presents itself to the South, leaning off towards 
the Southwest also.  Trees appear in numbers down towards the South, lining 
the path and the same to the Southwest.  Southwards, the floor is much 
grainier as weeds and blades of grass peak through the paved floor.  Towards 
the East, a path runs through the small enclosed area out between more shops 
and cottages.

    <desc>Here is the start to Snitch End where one finds him or herself in between a 
wall of trees. Further south there shows to be a long path that is lined by 
the very trees that surrounded this part of the path. To the north, the main 
walk is placed, a slightly more maintained path than what is beneath ones 
feet. The floor is covered in small pebbles that are accompanied by small 
weeds and several blades of grass that sit neatly embedded between various 
stones. The trees are Fern, maintained and seem bushy with purpose, though 
they create a wall like area that filters the entire path giving one an 
oppertunity to pass either north or south.

    <desc>The cobblestone street stretches from the Northeast and Southwest.  Simple 
flower boxes line the sides of the street, along with short, wispy trees 
which lend a natural beauty to the well kept road.  A tall lamppost, topped 
with a lantern, rises up on both sides of the street.  At the northern end 
of the street a small path leads to a rather modest building, it's thatched 
roof and simple structure making it quite welcoming.  Toward the South a 
short, winding path leads to a small cottage like structure.  Smoke of 
changing colour frequently wafts up and out of the brick chimney upon its 
thatched roof.

comprise the majority of the front wall.  At the back of this highly 
polished room sits a shiny desk.  A sign is posted on the front of the desk.  
Every spare inch of wall is covered in colour-coded shelves.  There are 
green shelves with tiny owls, red shelves with gigantic, powerful owls, and 
blue shelves with the average, run-of-the-mill owls perched there.  A few 
yellow shelves, near the desk, house the smallest owls, all very excitable, 
fluttering around wildly most of the time.  The movements of the birds are 
reflected in the highly polished floor.  The exit is to the south.

catcher.  It's beautiful wooden floor is kept polished neatly.  There are 
numerous shelves amongst the many things scattered in the corners, and many 
cages containing loud animals are seen resting on top of them carefully.  
Throughout the store there is a heavy scent of dirty fur, but not too much 
as to make one uncomfortable.  This shop is lighted by lanterns that are 
magically hovering in midair.  To the North is the door to the busy street 
of Hogsmeade, and above the door is a portrait of Algrey the Caring.

    <desc>. Wind whispers through the branches of the many trees planted along the 
cobblestone street.  A tall lamppost, topped with a lantern, rises up on 
both sides of the street, and simple flower boxes border the street on both 
sides.  Travel upon the road is heavy at times during the daylight hours and 
a peaceful quiet rules the night.  The occasional chirp of birds when the 
sun is up or the hoot of an owl at night might be heard.  A narrow street to 
the North appears well kept and often traveled, as the cobblestones are 
smooth and worn.  The High Street continues to the Northeast and Southwest.

    <desc>Running to the north and south, this path starts out as a paved road 
branching off from &quot;The High Street,&quot; but soon the pavement switches over 
into a plain dirt road.  In the distance, a small, deteriorating thatched 
cottage is visible.  A few trees have been planted along the road to shade 
travelers, but all of the trees seem to be dead or dying.  The dirt path 
here doesn't seem particularly well maintained, with weeds steadily 
overtaking the road.

    <desc>This chamber is relatively empty, and quite impersonal.  A large, wooden 
bed, covered in new, dark-blue, silk sheets, awaits its next occupant.  The 
walls are entirely white, and two small chandeliers are hanging down from 
the ceiling.  There is a two-door wardrobe on the eastern side of the 
chamber, with an oval-shaped mirror on the right-hand side door.  A small 
writing table on the western side is accompanied by a make-up table, with a 
hair-brush and make-up cases in the shape of an ebony raven.  The windows 
are covered by dark-blue, velvet curtains.

cobblestones line the way showing the wear of age and use.  A tall lamppost, 
topped with a lantern, rises up on both sides of the street, and simple

The High Street continues on to the Northeast and Southwest.

    <desc>A soft, puffy rug made entirely of feathers and soft twigs covers the wooden 
floor of the cottage.  In the very centre of the chamber stands a snug 
little nest made of hay and perfumed with exotic, sweet oils.  A few, small, 
brightly-burning candles bathe the entire room in a light reminiscent of 
moon rays.  Tiny bird-houses of various shapes and sizes are aligned along 
the slightly outward-curved walls; an occasional chirp or hum attests to the 
presence of life within them.  Thin branches and twigs erupt at odd 
intervals from the feather-made wallpaper, refreshing and dewy to the touch. 
 Crystal basins of clear water stand at every few feet around the large 
nest, whispering softly to each other in secretive tones.  Scattered all 
over the cabin and always available to its winged occupants are walnuts, 
nuts, and acorns.  The windows are boarded by thick-growing ivy, which 
extends nearly as far as the southern, large, dark-brown door.

      <desc>The nest is spherical, with a small entrance about three feet above the 
ground level.  Inside is a blanket made of hay and twigs, soft and soothing 
to the touch.  A small crown of flowers in the shape of a heart hangs just 
above two mounds of feathers, which serve as pillows.  The thick, 
slightly-damp scent of lavender and exotic oils surrounds the unusual bed.

      <desc>Thick vines board the windows of the cottage, slipping through the cracks in 
the wood frame like agile, hungry snakes.  Their leaves are a dark-grey 
colour that appears black under the fading candle-light.  Soft, elongated 
fingers caress the feather rug with a gentle, non-disrupting touch.  Flying 
carelessly about, the birds chirp amusedly as they pass by, sometimes 
causing a lazy vine to playfully curl in mid air, as though trying to grasp 
them.

    <desc>Thick brush and weeds creep over the bumpy dirt road, making passage through 
here very difficult.  Knotty vines spread their rough leaves upon the 
ground, a feeble attempt to shade the parched ground.  Their curling fingers 
intertwine to form a thick weave of vines.  Beside the vaguely-defined path 
dense walls of trees enclose the space.  The path winds its way to the east

large, smooth stones cemented together.  The east wall is dominated by a 
huge fireplace.  A roaring fire sends light and warmth throughout the entire 
room.  A simple, little bed and set of drawers lie alongside the western

centre path almost blocking the way through.  Dead, rotting leaves line the 
track adding a thick carpet of slippery sludge over patches of already muddy 
pathway.  Bright red, poisonous-looking berries can be seen on the bushes 
and squashed in to the dark mud providing the only splash of colour as far 
as the eye can see.  The path continues both on to the east to Hogsmeade and 
on in to the west.

    <desc>The bushes lining the path lean eerily over the road, their scrawny limbs 
outstretched as though to catch unwary passerby. Violently red berries cling 
to the branches where they can, and those that have lost their grip are 
lying forlornly on the pathway. A strange stench arises from those that are 
squashed. The pathway itself is hardly a path, for only patches of the 
original dirt road can be seen beneath decaying leaves and creeping vines. 
Haunting trees stretch skyward on either side of the walkway, nearly 
obscuring the sky. A dark structure can be seen in the distance to the 
northeast. Westward lies Hogsmeade.

    <desc>The path meets with the dead grass of an unkempt yard here.  Just beyond the 
road, past the grass, is a mysterious-looking building.  The old, 
dilapidated house has had all of its windows, as well as various other 
cracks and openings, boarded up.  Vines crawl up around the walls, reaching 
wispy tendrils up to the patched roof.  Rolling hills paint a backdrop for 
the ramshackle building, which looks as if it popped right out of a spooky 
story.  Deep ruts and holes mar the dirt road.  The road travels on to the 
southwest and the strange house is to the east.

    <desc>The road branches off into four directions.  To the Northeast and West, the 
tree lined High Street continues its lazy way through Hogsmeade.  A tall 
lamppost, topped with a lantern, rises up on both sides of the street, and 
simple flower boxes border the street on both sides.  A small building is to 
the South, a sign hanging above the entrance showing three crossed 
broomsticks.  Several windows along the walls of the place show a well lit 
room, filled with tables.  The outside of the building is painted an earthy 
red, with a thatched roof above.  A small cottage with a similarly thatched 
roof is to the North.

    <desc>Hardly anything is visible in the almost complete darkness of this hallway.  
Only the small amount of light that emanates from the room to the north 
catches on the splintered glass of an old, smashed lantern on the floor.  
The only other visible space in the passageway is to the end of the hall 
where a dim, yellow light, shining down from above, pools around the base of 
a rickety, wooden staircase.  The room is icy cold and the strong, 
unpleasant smell of damp permeates the air.  To the west is the front door, 
boarded and heavily barricaded except for a gap in one corner just large 
enough for a human to squeeze through.

    <desc>This pleasant cottage seems normal, except that it looks as if it has not 
been used in months.  The swirls and eddies of the fine, airborne silt can 
be seen in the bright lantern light that fills the room.  The cedar floor, 
covered by a thin layer of dust, allows footprints to be left wherever one 
steps.  By the western wall there is a large queen sized bed, whose bright 
blue bedspread is coated in dirt.  Opposite of the bed are two plush 
armchairs situated around an old radio.  In the back, large windows give a 
view of a covered pool along side a rusting charcoal grill.  The exit is to 
the south.

the road weeds and flowers grow together: tall and colourful.  The few 
willows on the southeastern side of Willow lane bend languidly over tall, 
bold rose-bushes.  To the northwest are the outskirts of a forest.  A few 
solitary oaks precede a small group of dark trees.  The wild scent of the 
forest mixes with the sweet perfume of flowers and willows.  The path 
continues to the east and to the southwest of this point.

    <desc>The path is very narrow in this spot. There are long, white markings on the ground and plants. It would appear someone came through swinging an open bucket of paint. On either side there are a lot of weeds and a few flowers. To the right there is a large, pink ball that is glowing and humming slightly. There is no shade here, except if one were to wander off the path itself.

The pink ball, upon close inspection, is actually a nest for some sort of small pixie-like bug. The humming is the constant beat of wings from inside the nest, and the pink color is from each of the bugs individual lights.

    <desc>The wooden floor of the Three Broomsticks is clean and shows no sign of 
patching or repairs.  Large poles, a few inches apart from one another, 
support the flat, wooden roof, their tops barely visible amidst the heavy 
smoke that permanently embraces the ceiling, like an ethereal wallpaper.  
Dozens of tables are gathered around the large fireplace to the east of the 
room, basking in the bright light of the flames.  Three windows to the north 
and two on the western side of the inn are clean, albeit slightly foggy from 
the excess of smoke.  During daytime, light streams through them into the 
lobby, reaching the feet of a large bar that stands against the southern 
wall.  A mirror surrounded by bottles of every drink imaginable, from 
Butterbeer to Lysander's Draught of Death, reflects the cosy, almost sleepy 
atmosphere of the place.  A dark-brown, wooden door stands to the north.

burden of bottles of various shapes and sizes.  In the middle of the bar 
hangs a mirror, beneath which is a large box with multiple compartments, 
which serves as a counter.  Butterbeer is neatly stacked on the lower 
shelves, while the stronger drinks are higher up.  Visible amongst the many 
labels are names like Firewhiskey, Shimmering vodka, Forgetfulness, and 
Lysander's Draught of Death.

that surround the fireplace, soothing and mysterious.

    <desc>This small cabin seems normal except that it has been decorated in bright 
orange and black.  The lanterns in here give off a soft yellow-orange light 
that fills the room.  On the western wall, there is a small bed covered in a 
blazing orange bedspread emblazoned with a large Chudley Cannons logo.  
Opposite of that are rows of pictures of past and current Chudley Cannons 
players.  The windows in back are partially covered by a set of Chudley 
Cannons curtains, but it is still possible to see the small pond in the 
backyard.  Near the center of the room is a large leather armchair and a 
wooden table, which has on it a small model of Galvin Gudgeon.  To the north 
is the exit.

      <desc>Here, there are rows upon rows of Chudley Cannons players. Prominently featured in the center of the exhibit is the current manager of the team Ragmar Dorkins. He seems to be a short, stout fellow with a large Chudley Cannons logo pasted on his robes.

    <desc>The tree lined street runs to the east and turns a corner to the Northwest.  
Benches can be seen under the canopy of some of the larger trees, providing 
protection from sun and rain.  A tall lamppost, topped with a lantern, rises 
up on both sides of the street, and simple flower boxes border the street on 
both sides.  To the South, a building with a single, round window and round 
door can be seen.  The structure is made from large logs, which are set in 
perfect symmetry and unpainted.

    <desc>. The well kept, tree lined road continues to the East and West.  Simple 
flower boxes line the sides of the street, and a tall lamppost, topped with 
a lantern, rises up on both sides of the way.  Shoppers, residents, and the 
occasional dog or cat might be seen visiting the shops and other 
establishments upon the High Street.  To the North, a quaint little shop 
with a pink tiled facade and gray thatched roof, sports a small sign 
fashioned in the shape of a hat.  To the South, Rook Lane starts.

    <desc>The shop is abundant in mannequin heads on short stands.  Upon the heads are 
hats of all kinds.  Pointed wizard hats, hats with frogs, even hats that 
speak when asked a question.  Two glass-encased cabinets showcase an 
assortment of very delicate hats, some with colorful plumes or flamboyant 
feathers.  One cabinet's delights are of a feminine design while the other 
is more masculine.

    <copyright>Copyright © 2004-2010  Project Legilimensia</copyright>
    <desc>Rich, beautifully-arranged, white-cobblestone patterns lead the way into a 
handsome, well-tended street.  A few tall, patient-looking, linden trees 
bend low over the alleyway, their mature branches spreading sideways, in 
warm greeting.  The sweet perfume of their leaves is thick in the 
refreshing, peaceful air.  Erupting from behind a low, light-brown, wooden 
fence are flowers of all colours, welcoming visitors into a squared brick 
house to the east.  On the other side of the path stands a shabby-looking 
building.  The two large nails sticking out from beneath its flat roof look 
as though they were once used to hang a sign of some sort.  The fluttering 
of butterflies and the humming of bees during the day, doubled by cricket 
song at night, fills the atmosphere with a sense of a constantly-busy 
existence.  To the north, Rook Lane spills into the luminous High Street of 
Hogsmeade, while a tidy, beautiful alley leads south, between parallel sets 
of buildings.

      <desc>A perfectly-symmetric, pyramidal-shaped, thatched roof stands above the 
square, brick house that lies east of Rook Lane.  The building is not new, 
but looks well-tended and orderly, with carefully-cleaned, large, round 
windows and a rectangular, black, wooden door.  Geometric patterns run 
through the small front garden, although some rebel flowers and blades of 
grass have grown slightly-askew since the last time the laws was cleaned.  A 
large wooden sign placed in the garden reads: &quot;For Sale&quot;.

      <desc>The clean, perfectly-chiselled cobblestones spiral and swirl in majestic, 
criss-crossing patterns that seem to erupt from each other.  Every inch of

attention to the path as a whole, rather than to individual components 
thereof.

      <desc>Wide and tall, the building has the appearance of an unused shop.  Its 
decrepit walls, made of sturdy oak, appear damp and musky, as though barely 
holding on, while the windows are covered with years-old grime and cobwebs.  
Although the door appears to have been somewhat cleaned, it still sports a 
few deep cuts, as though made by a large animal with five toes to each paw.  
In an attempt to perhaps cover them, a board has been nailed to the 
entrance, with the word &quot;For Sale&quot; painted black on a dirty, grey 
background.

the sides of the street, along with short, wispy trees.  A tall lamppost, 
topped with a lantern, rises up on both sides of the street.  To the north 
is a bright store front, with a large picture window, sporting some 
lettering.  Beneath the words are some drawn pictures of sugary confections. 
 Below the window a colourful flowerbed provides a burst of colour in the 
form of red tulips, yellow daffodils, and velvety violets.  To the South is 
a small cottage with a thatched roof.  The High Street continues to the East 
and West.

    <desc>At the entrance to Honeydukes is a welcome mat, worn down by the many feet 
passing over the threshold into the sweetshop.  Rows and rows of candy line 
the walls, a collage of sugar in every colour of the rainbow.  On either 
side of the door are trees of gigantic, rainbow swirled lollipops, ranging 
in size from large to mammoth.  Mountains of sweets fill the large display 
window at the front of the shop.  Bags of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans, 
barrels of Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, boxes of Ice Mice, and more, grace 
this large window.  On the window the following has been written in cheery 
handwriting: &quot;`YHoneydukes Sweet Shop`^&quot;.  `wThe counter at the back of the store 
is labelled, &quot;`MOur famous homemade fudge`w&quot; and shows of a delightful array of 
the sweet chocolate confection that Honeydukes so prides itself in.  The 
`wexit to the south leads out to The High Street and a stairwell at the back 
of the store leads down.`^

flowers, in beautiful tinges of lilac, red, and white stand out vividly 
amidst the large, green surface.  Tiny twigs are visible here and there 
amongst the sea of leaves.  Swarms of tiny insects, from the smallest fly to 
the fluffiest bumblebee, crowd around the hedges.  The perfume of the tiny 
flowers is nearly overpowering.  The hedges open up into a wider street to 
the northwest, and continues to the east.

    <desc>Wooden floorboards creak reassuringly inside the small, squared shop.  Three 
foot high tables, scattered everywhere across the room.  Hold a multitude of 
children's books with flashy covers.  The walls are covered in numerous 
bookcases, filled with reading delights for young and teenage witches and 
wizards.  Small chandeliers hang from the ceiling, spreading a warm, orange 
glow, across the entire chamber.  There are no windows and a pleasant odour 
of old parchment lingers in the dry air, mixed with a delicate perfume of 
lavender that erupts from the very walls.  To the south is a discrete 
staircase that leads to an upstairs chamber.  A light door, made of willow, 
stands to the north.

about Muggles, with ridiculously-unmoving pictures upon them.

    <desc>A single, black lamppost stands on the east side of the narrow road, topped 
by a cylindrical, glass lamp.  Ivy grows wildly in the entire area, covering 
the base of the lamppost, the cobblestone-paved street, and two tall walls 
that stand to the east and west.  Dirtied by age and chipped around the 
edges, the tired cobblestones provide little resistance against the attack 
of flowerless weeds that slither amongst the ivy vines, reaching out to the 
sky.  A musky scent lingers thickly in the air, attracting millions of tiny 
flies that buzz around ceaselessly, day and night.  The lane spills south 
into the larger, more luminous High Street, while a northern alley narrowly 
leads on between buildings to a dingy end.

      <desc>The two walls are about eight foot high, made of mud and stone rather than 
bricks.  Their surfaces are nearly completely level, any denting have been 
smoothed out by time and the insisting ivy that embraces them tightly.  With 
bases slightly thicker than their rounded tops, they stand very straight and 
firm.

      <desc>The ivy is thick, of a dark-green colour, with healthy vines that stretch 
everywhere across the road, engulfing the two bordering walls and the base 
of the lamppost as well.  Its leaves have a wax-like shine and area almost 
perfectly elliptical, except for their pointed tips.  The plant keeps 
pulsating in a rhythm similar to a human heartbeat, and its long, 
serpent-like fingers move to avoid any dangers or annoyances.  Diminutive 
flies constantly buzz around it.

      <desc>A thicker, iron, conic base leads up into a cylindrical, iron post that ends 
with a handsome, glass-encased lamp.  The glass is thick and blurs the 
clarity of the light, producing instead a vague, orange glow.  A small note 
placed three feet above the ground reads: &quot;Warning: Unbreakable Glass, 
enchanted with a permanent Shield Charm.  Any hexes on its surface will be 
deflected.&quot;

    <desc>This large, neatly ordered business is all about quills and their related 
peripherals.  An assortment of quills stretch around the shop in a display 
that winds from the eastern wall to the western wall.  Large lanterns light 
up the whole room with bright white light.  The eastern wall holds the 
low-quality and utility quills.  On the western wall are some quills that 
are a bit more expensive, but are of better quality and fabrication.  In the 
centre of the store are piles of motley parchment and many bottles of basic 
inks.  A prominent display in the front of the store shows a huge collection 
of quills that range from Auto-Answer to spell checking varieties.  The back 
is a long, glass counter that features a miscellany of specialty and 
high-quality quills.  The exit is to the north.

    <desc>Three foot high walls, covered with angry, thick vines, border the narrow 
street on both sides.  Time has eroded the edges of the cobblestone path, 
which is now a vague tinge of green from all the moss covering it.  Dark, 
thorny weeds, with pale-white flowers stand at the edges of the lane.  Flies 
swarm around the damp patches of green moss, enjoying the damp, sickly sweet 
scent in the air.  Their never-ceasing buzzing is dull and high-pitched, 
like the scream of a fast Bludger.  The northern path leads to the luminous 
High Street, while to the south the alley continues for a distance until it 
reaches a dead end.

      <desc>The dark-grey walls bordering the lane are covered in thick vines which grow 
in elegant curls, reaching out in all directions.  Tightly embracing the 
hard stone, the ivy pulsates in a strange rhythm, as if breathing.  Its tips 
are sharp and slightly lighter in colour, resembling long fingernails.

    <desc>The narrow street is old, damp, and dank, made of cobblestones that might 
once have been white, but that are now chipped around the edges and covered 
in green moss.  Dark-green weeds have invaded the path, hungrily clustering 
in the smallest of spaces.  Two small shops stand on the sides of the path, 
surrounded by fences which struggle to keep fast-growing ivy in check.  The 
air is thick with a lingering scent of decay and dust, which attracts swarms 
of dubious-looking insects, infernally buzzing around anything green.  A 
luminous patch to the north marks the junction between the Station Approach 
and the High Street of Hogsmeade, while to the south, the way becomes even 
darker, only to finish with a dead end a few dozen feet away.

      <desc>Every space between the cobblestones that pave the lane is filled up with 
dirty, hungry, dark-green weeds.  Their flowers are an attractive yellow, 
but their edges have a poisonous-looking brown tinge to them.  Thorns erupt 
from beneath their leaves at irregular intervals, bent like a spider's 
pincers.

    <desc>Cobblestones are missing from the narrow street, having been completely 
eroded by time and pushed away by insistent, thorny weeds.  The dank 
alleyway is a sickly, murky-green colour, covered in moss and ivy.  A small 
lawn on the western side of the path leads to a dark-green, shabby cottage, 
while to the east stands a dirty caricature of a palace with a muddy, brown 
top.  The air is thick with a horrid combination of disgusting smells, as 
though coming from a corpse left to rot, an impression strengthened by the 
constant buzzing of hundreds of insects of all shapes and sizes.  The road 
brightens up to the south as it leads to the end of the street, while to the 
north lies the junction with the High Street.

      <desc>The dark-green of the cottage clashes terribly with the dark-brown door with 
vertical, grey stripes.  Two squared windows are nearly completely covered 
by black, dirty shutters, stained with orange and scarlet.  Although there 
is no chimney, vague smoke surrounds the house, extending to the weedy, dark 
green lawn.

leans heavily to the south, the shop has a small, yellow sign hanging down 
from a rusty, old nail.  The shaky, handwritten, black letters upon it read: 
&quot;The Love Palace.&quot;  Its dark-red door is scratched and sports some nasty 
burns.

    <desc>Glowing flowers of red, blue, yellow, and green continuously spray gentle 
sparks into the air along this path.  Small, glistening creatures, with 
long, white wings, fly around the area.  The trees, which are plentiful, 
appear to have velvet covering their branches as they, too, shine brightly.  
There is a source of light at the heart of each magical organism.  An 
intrinsic glow fills each living thing with a light so bright and so 
magnificent, the creature can not help but gleam.  The wide, spectacular 
path nears its end to the south, and to the north is a cobblestone road.  To 
the east and west are, respectively, two locked doors.

    <desc>The cobblestone street shows signs of recent restoration, being visibly 
older and chipped around the edges in some parts only to sport new, white 
sections amidst them.  In season, flowers are encouraged to grow on both 
sides of the road, but any weeds are carefully stomped out.  To the west 
stands a cramped shop with a wooden porch leading up to it.  A white sign 
leaning below one of its windows reads 'Delilah's Furniture'.  Opposite the 
small building is a dark-brown cottage with a well-kept lawn.  The air is 
quiet and peaceful; a delicate, sweet perfume lingers in the air.  The path 
brightens as it leads north towards the High Street, while to the south lies 
the last section of Station Approach.

tiny, squared windows.  The porch that leads up to it is made of solid oak,

Peaceful puffs of smoke come out of the low chimney, expanding into 
fantastic shapes before disappearing through the air.  The small front lawn 
is well tended, with a serpentine path parting two immaculate and 
equally-lovely sections.  Scarlet and white flowers peek shyly from the 
shadows of a few low trees, welcoming visitors with a sweet, soft perfume.  
The door of the cottage is carved of mahogany, with a small, diamond-shaped 
window about a quarter of the way down.

    <desc>A three foot high, stone wall, sprouting dark-green ivy, blocks the way 
south.  The street is narrow and made of cobblestones that look well 
cared-for, although worn by time and weather.  Small blades of grass 
tentatively grow by the roadsides, having been banished from the main road.  
They are surrounded by tiny, wild flowers, in pale tinges of white and pink, 
which attract a few fluffy, humming bumblebees.  A dark-brown cottage stands 
to the east, covered in ivy and with a wild front garden.  Opposite the 
small house is a square, cosy-looking building with a large sign above it, 
reading: &quot;The Weary Traveller&quot;.  Soothing, low chirping of birds accompanies 
occasional, gentle breezes.  A narrow, stone alleyway leads north, 
eventually spilling into the High Street of Hogsmeade.

leaves at odd intervals, while ignoring the gentle prodding of the wind.  
Passionately embracing the southern wall of the alleyway, it has almost 
completely covered it.  The slightly-damp, fresh scent of its leaves 
attracts some buzzing flies, which the plant lazily banishes every once in a 
while, with a sharp, hissing lash of its long fingers.

like a Cyclops' eye, while a constant, high-pitched music surrounds the 
strange building.  A lonely chimney sends rare puffs of smoke into the air.

    <desc>The room is relatively large and packed with solid, wooden tables surrounded 
by mismatching and slightly shabby-looking armchairs.  Along the northern 
wall stretches a long wooden bar, with a few bar stools before it.  The 
fierce glow of the fireplace in the north-eastern corner sheds a bright, 
orange light on the dark wooden beams that cover the ceiling.  The wooden 
floor has been covered haphazardly with dusty rugs of various sizes.  The 
only exit is to the east.

    <desc>A long bar, made from cherry wood is polished to a high shine.  Five round 
tables, each with four straight back wooden chairs set in the center of the 
establishment.  A field stone fireplace is set into one wall and a stack of 
quarter cut logs set in a brass bin.  Crystal candleholders extend from the 
walls, providing a gentle light from the burning candles within.  The smell 
of cedar smoke is strong in the air and the high ceiling maintains a 
constant haze of rising smoke from the fireplace.

The shop is small and cramped. From end to end there are multitudinous pieces of furniture lining the store, leaving only a narrow aisle for customers to walk through. Some couches sport decorations, such as Troll skin or fanged armrests, while others levitate when sat upon. Large, brightly lit chandeliers take up most of the ceiling space. There is a large, white poster with sparkling blue writing on the wall behind the cash register. There is only one door and it leads east.

This shop has the 'Weird Sisters' music blaring quite loudly. There are mannequins in all sorts of robes: ones that flare at the end, ones that are very fitted, some beautifully designed dress robes. The shop workers are wearing clothes from Sophie's and everyone in the overly crowded shop is a teenage witch. Clearly, this is a popular store for girls to get the latest fashions from. At the very front of the store is a section for perfumes, in which are a few girls spraying each other and giggling. At the very rear is a spot for the make-up.

    <desc>. Bramble Cottage is quite a strange place.  Shaped like a horseshoe, there 
is no rug but instead white sand covers the ground.  The walls are covered 
in ivy and grape vines so that the wall itself can not be seen, and in fact 
there may not be a wall there at all.  The ceiling is full of many 
galleon-sized holes which serve as miniature skylights during the day.  
There is no furniture of any kind in the cottage; there are also no windows 
and only one clearly unused door which leads east.

      <desc>The ceiling is high: about twelve feet.  It has been painted an ugly green 
colour and specks of black and brown are thrown randomly in on the surface.  
Many galleon-sized holes cover the ceiling, and upon close inspection it is 
seen that a pane of glass covers each small hole.  In the centre of the 
ceiling is a far larger hole.  Shaped as a large oval and roughly three feet 
in diameter, this hole is large enough to climb through.  There is a vine 
hanging lazily from the hole.

    <desc>This cottage is a complete mess with finished quills and feathers all over 
the place.  Along the eastern wall is a comfortably large double bed which 
seems to not have been made in days.  In here the stone floor, which is 
covered in feathers, is lighted by a bubble of intense white light, which is 
suspended in mid-air near the ceiling.  Opposite the bed are four huge, 
partially opened crates that contain many different types of feathers.  In 
the back of the cottage is a large work desk with various intricate tools on 
it.  To the north is the exit.

    <desc>.
The shop is hardly a palace - in fact it is more of a shack. The floors are dirty and the ceiling is grimy. Almost everything is covered in a disgusting layer of filth. There is a row along the back wall and three horizontal rows full of ludicrous things such as &quot;Ever-Lasting Love: He'll love you until he dies!&quot; and &quot;Sour Revenge: He cheated on you, now he'll love a toad!&quot; The sales witch is a middle-aged woman with greying hair and teeth as dirty as her floor. There are posters hanging from the ceiling displaying things such as &quot;Love is a Role: Be the Star!&quot; and &quot;If you can't be beautiful then Make Everyone Else Ugly!&quot; The charms on the lights - torches - have long since needed replenishing, though it would appear the owner either does not care or is a squib.

The store is very well kept. The ceilings are five feet and about every five feet hang chandeliers that illuminate the room brilliantly. The 'shelves barely reach one's neck and everything on them is coordinated by type, colour, and strength. In the back of the store is a clear cabinet that has been charmed to keep its contents chilled. Nearly everything that isn't for sale is sparkling white. The only exit is West.

    <copyright>Copyright © 2005  Jessica Ayers &lt;slimshadylady78@hotmail.com&gt;</copyright>
    <desc>.
The Three Gables Cottage has nine rooms. The first is the living room. The room is large, decorated with forest green furniture and deep-brown walls, creating a forest theme. The wood is all dark mahogany. There is a fireplace in the centre, though the furniture is not centred around it. To the eat, through a sliding door, is the dining room. All the wood in this room is painted white, and the walls are wine coloured. There is a magnificent chandelier hanging from the ten-foot ceiling, and a fire place is opposite the large window. To the east of the dining room, through a small hole in the corner (the hole is magically charmed to appear as the rest of the wall does) is the kitchen and house-elf quarters. In the kitchen three house-elves scurry about attempting to prepare dinner. The kitchen has never been see by anyone except the house-elves so no one knows what it looks like. In the very rear of the cottage is a loo. The rest of the rooms are bedroom which are exactly identical to each other.

    <desc>. This spacious room has big, curtained windows looking out to the east, 
west, north and south.  A fireplace to the north harbours a sizzling 
cauldron hanging above a small fire.  In the middle of the room stands a 
large wooden table with four chairs.  On the table stands a red, stone vase 
containing branches of ivy, that trail down to the floor.  On the wall to 
the west, next to the window, hangs a painting in an ornate wooden frame.  
In this portrait a woman with long, black hair is depicted.  She sings 
continuously with a high-pitched screechy voice.  A small wooden cabinet, 
with six glass bottles on it, stands in a corner to the east.  There are no 
labels on them and they are empty.  On the floor, under the table, lies a 
yawning, white, bear rug.  There is an exit to the west.

Southeast.  Short, whispy trees planted along the sides of the High Street 
wave in the gentle breezes as fowl of the day or night roost or flitter from 
tree to tree.  The sweet smells of flowers in bloom can sometimes be sensed 
upon the gentle wind as small flower boxes lining the street lend their 
natural aroma.  A tall lamppost, topped with a lantern, rises up on both 
sides of the street.  To the South, Robin Hill road begins.

trees and bushes line the paved road.  To the south the road continues up 
onto the small hill.  Two lampposts line each side of the road, illuminating 
it when the path is dark.  North the road leads back onto &quot;The High Street&quot;.

    <desc>This cottage is in good shape, but empty, as though someone recently moved 
out.  A double bed rests with its head against the eastern wall, near the 
door, and one of its sides touching the northern wall.  At the foot of the 
bed, a closed chest makes its home.  A small nightstand sits on the southern 
side of the bed, and on it stands a lamp.  Embedded into the center of the 
western wall is a stone fireplace.  Sitting in the southeastern corner is a 
dark wooden picnic table.  A stone counter protrudes from the center of the 
southern wall, stretching to the western wall.  On the eastern wall the only 
exit, a wooden door, lies.

    <desc>The leaves of the small, whispy trees planted along the cobbled street, wave 
and whisper as wind softly breezes through them.  Travel upon the road is 
heavy at times during the daylight hours and a peaceful quiet rules the 
night.  A tall lamppost, topped with a lantern, rises up on both sides of 
the street, and simple flower boxes border the street on both sides.  A 
storefront can be seen to the north and a pleasant little cottage to the 
south.  The High Street continues on to the east and west.

    <copyright>Copyright © 2005  Iris</copyright>
    <desc>The shop's roomy interior is completely dedicated to clocks.  Old clocks and 
new clocks, big clocks and small clocks, decorative clocks and plain clocks 
cover every inch of wall and shelf space.  A large, antique grandfather 
clock sits prominently near the centre of the room.  The oak floor is worn 
smooth from years of foot traffic, but is kept swept and clean.  A wooden 
counter sits near the front of the store, and a large sign that reads 
&quot;Repairs Here&quot; hangs overhead.  Another sign near the back of the shop says 
&quot;Special Uses&quot;.  The clocks here are used for magical purposes only, like 
giving the chores for the day or reading off health problems.  Daylight 
peaks through the obscured windows during the daytime, but the main lighting 
in the room comes from the many golden candles that float near the roof.

ornately carved with beautiful lilies.  Its hands are sharp, golden points.  
Another clock sits in the back, under the &quot;Special Uses&quot; sign.  It yells out 
the set chores for the day whenever anyone walks by.  In the most remote 
corner of the room sits a small black clock.  It has a slot near the bottom 
that gives health reports out.

    <desc>. The worn stones of the paved road are kept clean and swept.  A small 
cottage to the north is built from wood with a red, thatched roof.  The 
trees that grow along the sides of The High Street provide shade for some 
iron benches that have been placed beneath a few of them.  Simple flower 
boxes border the street on both sides.  A tall lamppost, topped with a 
lantern, rises up on both sides of the street.  The inhabitants and visitors 
to Hogsmeade go about their business as they walk along the street or ride 
carriages and wagons along the way.  The High Street continues to the East 
and Southwest.

    <desc>Two wooden cupboards stand next to a small fireplace. A few blocks of wood lie on the floor, waiting to get burned. The bare wooden floor creaks and sighs under a heavy wooden desk, accompanied by four matching chairs, standing in the middle of the room. A dust-covered, damaged harp shows a complicated pattern of cobwebs between its strings, a broken music stand hides in a corner of the room. The simple, single, wooden bed provides a home for a family of fluttering moths. On either side of the two small windows hang oil lamps. A An exit lies to the south.

    <desc>This empty shop is dirty and unkempt, as though no one has paid it any 
attention in years.  Spiders and cobwebs make their homes in the corners and 
from the ceiling.  A rotting wooden sign hanging from a small balcony of the 
second floor reads, `Y &quot;COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENT.  FOR SALE.&quot;  `X.  The windows 
are covered in what looks like years of dust and other particles, making 
them cloudy.  A balcony, with a simple, wooden railing, sits upon the second 
story located about halfway back in the shop.  A spiral staircase leads to 
the current floor.  The wooden ceiling and walls rise up to two stories in 
half of the establishment, but are forced to only one story half way into 
the shop to the west.  Below the balcony, in the northwestern corner, a 
small counter sits.  To the east an old, wooden door leads out into a 
street.

    <desc>The sights and sounds of a busy township abound as children walk and play 
along the cobbled High Street.  Busy pedestrians tend to the business of the 
day as they venture from shop to shop or walk briskly en route to pending 
destinations.  The tree-lined road is clean swept and well worn from years 
of use.  A tall lamppost, topped with a lantern, rises up on both sides of 
the street, and simple flower boxes border the street on both sides.  To the 
North is a street called &quot;The Nook&quot;.  The High Street continues to the 
Northeast and Southwest.  A squat building to the South sports a colourful 
sign on the front.

    <desc>This fairly narrow road leads off to the north of &quot;The High Street&quot;, into a 
small cul-de-sac of cottages.  Trees continue from &quot;The High Street&quot; and 
keep lines the road, providing shade.  A single lamppost sits on the east 
side of the road, a small wooden sign on the opposite side.  In the distance 
to the north, rows of trees and plants can be seen, behind the white, 
wooden, orchard house at the end of the lane.  Two smaller cottages lie up 
the road, on each side of it.

    <desc>An arched ceiling and rounded corners slightly distort the proportions of 
the store, adding to its size and magnificence.  The chamber is wallpapered 
with large, old-looking bookcases, filled to the brim and emitting a lovely, 
dry scent of aging parchment.  Carefully-dimmed candlelight, coming from the 
shop's three chandeliers, bathes the room in soothing, orange and mauve 
glows.  A wooden counter rises in an undisruptive manner amidst a few low 
tables covered in books.  The soft tunes of quiet songs, mainly interpreted 
by the Heartbroken Witches, are barely audible, echoing beautifully off the 
thick, wooden ceiling.  A rickety door to the south leads into the clean, 
bright High Street.

anything from horrific to deeply romantic and thick books dedicated to 
educational-related literature, neatly categorized by subject, from the 
dullest Potions manual to the most exciting Dark Arts protection guide.  
Regardless of the topic they cover or the time when they were written,

      <desc>Four tables are placed in artistic disorder around a small, wooden counter.  
Each table is dedicated to the single, most successful book in history in 
its genre.  'The life of Albus Dumbledore - Brilliance and Madness' by 
Corinna Eaglefeather has been chosen as the best of all biographies, while 
wizarding fiction is topped by 'Into the Werewolf's Dream' by Alistair 
Bones.  'Letters from Beneath' by Darrin Macmillan is elected as the best 
collection of poetry and 'Know Thy Enemy!  - a complete guide against the 
Dark Arts' by Endora Kimble is recognized as the greatest educational 
achievement.

      <desc>An illustration of an impressive, silver-haired man with blue eyes and a 
very crooked nose smiles benignly from the cover of the biography.  On the 
back of the book is a small passage that reads: &quot;Beloved Headmaster of 
Hogwarts, mentor, and professor, Albus Dumbledore remains to this day the 
most brilliant wizard that ever lived.  Through many achievements that have 
revolutionized our way of understanding magic, he has become celebrated and 
honoured in most wizarding circles.  Not many, however, loved or even liked 
this genial mind: in fact many agree upon the fact that Albus Dumbledore was 
'batty at the very least' and 'outright mad'.  In this, the mad genius is 
finally revealed and revered as he ought to be, to the satisfaction of all.&quot; 
 A small line is written underneath this paragraph: &quot;A well-deserved 
monument to the memory of the greatest wizard that ever lived - Maxine 
Lagrange.&quot;

      <desc>The thick novel has a leather cover, with an illustration of a half wolf, 
half man character howling at a full moon.  A small caption on the back 
reads: &quot;The werewolf waited, its ears perched high, awaiting its prey.  Its 
breathing was deep and quiet, and it endured silently the biting cold that 
ruffled through its thin coat.  The woman was coming towards it, whistling 
unconcernedly, a small bundle held in her arms.  The tantalizing pounding of 
fresh blood deafened the werewolf.  Its breathing broke into a tense 
panting.  Then suddenly it pounced.&quot;  Written in golden letters underneath 
this passage, there is another line: &quot;'Once more, Alistair Bones has shown 
that he is, irrevocably, a master of his genre.  ' - The Daily Prophet&quot;.

emotion and passion, Darrin Macmillan writes poetry of splendid beauty, in 
the form of letters to the mysterious Lady Teaf.  This anthology includes 'I 
am Beneath' and 'Apostle to the Moon', celebrated as the most accomplished 
poetical achievements of all time.&quot;  Written in silver letters underneath is 
a caption that reads: &quot;Filled with a passion so fierce it tears at the heart 
and makes it shiver and bleed, Macmillan's poems remain to this day the most 
faithful characterization of the human soul.&quot;

      <desc>The rather-thick book is covered by an unpretentious, leather cover with an 
image of a witch and wizard poised for an imminent battle against an unseen 
adversary.  The title is written in large, golden letters upon a black 
background.  A small passage on the back of the book reads: &quot;The Dark Arts 
are everlasting and ever changing.  The power to battle them lies not, as 
many are convinced, in the knowledge of innumerable hexes and spells, but in 
remembering the most important ones.  This anthology is dedicated to the 
analysis of the Dark Arts and to the most appropriate measures one can take 
to protect oneself against them.  Recommended to wizards and witches older 
than thirteen years of age.&quot;

a straw, thatched roof, supported by wooden beams, in the shape of a 
pyramid.  The floor and walls are made out of a variety of stones with 
mortar to fill the cracks.  A wooden door lies on the eastern wall.

This shop is quite small, though there is a definite grandmother's-house quality to it. Along each of the walls are shelves full of dolls. Some of the dolls talk, some move, some can even walk around a bit. The register is in the centre of the room, and next to it, on a stool, is an elderly witch holding a blank doll's body. She is waving her wand over it as the doll takes form. In the far right corner is a young wizard and an assistant. They appear to be looking at the dolls that speak. The room is lit by a long, thin cylinder which runs the length of the shop and glows brightly. There is a sign on the register.

If you're a collector with a gentle touch,
Or a wizard and want to show that you love her very much.
If you're a grandmother hoping to start a tradition
Or an uncle on a birthday-present mission
Then come one, come all, and have yourselves a look!
After all, a doll is much better than a book.

broomsticks zooming about, others constantly change in colour and design.  
Next to the socks are some pointed wizard hats on a hat stand.  There are 
pointed wizard hats in a selection of colours and fabrics including some 
embroidered with Quidditch team logos.  Farther back a handsome oak counter 
has become cluttered with measuring tapes and parchment with measurements 
scrawled onto them.  Glowing candles, hovering near the ceiling, softly 
light the store.  Out to the south is the road.

    <desc>The tree lined street is clean swept and free of any litter or debris.  Worn 
stones line the way showing the marking of heavy use.  A tall lamppost, 
topped with a lantern, rises up on both sides of the street and simple 
flower boxes border the street on both sides.  To the North, a small cottage 
with short bushes in the front and a slate roof can be seen while to the 
South a long building with a red roof, has two half doors that swing in two 
directions when passed.  The High Street runs to the west and curves to the 
Northeast.

    <copyright>Copyright © 2005  Jessica Ayers &lt;slimshadylady78@hotmail.com&gt;</copyright>
    <desc>Quite a few tables litter the tiled floor of Lily's Lunchbox.  Along the 
northern wall, in front of a large paneled window, are booths.  A fire roars 
happily on the west wall of the store, and every booth has a torch glowing 
over it.  ON the east wall is a wrap-around bar.  On one side of the bar 
rest seven golden bar stools.  A picture hangs sweetly on the southern wall. 
 The door - a mighty wooden one - leads north to High Street, and is the 
only exit.

      <desc>The fabric on the seat of the booths and the seat of the chairs is the same: 
a silky red.  Gold poles stand between each booth to serve as a coat rack, 
and there is a similar looking pole next to the entrance.  Each of the 
tables is a shimmering, dark blue.  Placed directly in the center of each 
table is a tall, red candle that is laced with Amortentia.

      <desc>The picture is of a pretty girl of about sixteen years.  Hanging around her 
neck is a golden heart with the name &quot;Rose&quot; engraved in cursive.  Rose has 
shoulder-length, auburn hair which happens to be unusually curly.  Though, 
by far, the most intriguing aspect of the photograph is the background.  
Rose appears to be standing in front of a beautiful ocean backdrop with a 
warm, pink sky.  Yet she is also standing on grass and the sun is in the 
center of the sky, not the horizon.

    <desc>The High Street winds to the Northwest from this point and continues to the 
East as well.  The aged, well worn street is well kept, clean of debris and 
dirt.  Simple flower boxes line the sides of the street, along with short, 
wispy trees.  A tall lamppost, topped with a lantern, rises up on both sides 
of the way.  Either side of the street is occupied by a building.  To the 
North, is a thatch roofed structure with small windows and a green door.  To 
the South is a two story dwelling with double wide front doors and a long 
bay window.  Below the bay window, a flower garden grows and to the left 
side of the front yard, small shrubs and bushes in great variation are 
clumped together.  There is a long sign set over the front door.

    <desc>Just off the High Street, Wheelbarrow Avenue is set in perpetual shadow by 
the dense branches of the tall yew trees lining it on both sides.  There are 
many gaps in the cobblestone road, and many more stones raised or lowered by 
what seems centuries of inattention.  There is a single lamppost, which 
casts a very weak yellow light about the street at night, though it seems to 
cause more of the shadow than it solves.  Wheelbarrow Avenue continues on to 
the northwest, and the High Street lies to the south.

      <desc>The cobblestones of the road are ancient, and have been worn slick by the feet and carts that have passed over them for centuries. They've clearly seen better days and have long suffered from neglect. There are many holes and raised stones in the road to be tripped over.

      <desc>The Irish Yew that line this street bear dense branches that block all but mid-day sunlight and serve to give one the sense of being in a tunnel. They appear to stand nearly 30 feet in height, and haven't been trimmed in what seem to be centuries. In many cases their branches intermingle creating a natural wall.

    <desc>This old shop is in a state of slight disrepair.  Most of the interior is 
wood, with wood panelling on the walls and rough oak for the floor.  Little 
splinters of wood have pulled out of the walls, making the surface rough and 
prickly.  Fat, stubby candles float near the ceiling, just below the exposed 
beams that support the visible roof.  Rows of shelves in the centre of the 
room display a variety of magical items which could use mending.  Shattered 
Sneakoscopes, cracked cauldrons, dented Dark Detectors and others are piled 
haphazardly onto the shelves.  At the back of the shop is a counter, upon 
which sits an array of tools and a partially assembled lunascope.  The exit 
of this shop, to the north, leads out the road.

    <desc>White-grey stones pave this long, well-worn street.  Laid straight and with 
magical precision, the stones have uniform gaps between them.  Simple flower 
boxes line the sides of the street, along with short, wispy trees.  A tall 
lamppost, topped with a lantern, rises up on both sides of the street.  
Buildings seem to become more numerous to the Southeast.  To the South is a 
tiny, simple cottage.  The High Street continues on to the Northwest and 
Southeast.

against the far wall with a brick mantle supported by two stone columns.  To 
one side of the hearth is a brass container filled with chopped wood logs 
while on the other side is a similar container filled with kindling.  A cast 
iron rack is nearby holding a small shovel, broom and poker iron.  Two, 
overstuffed, straight back chairs and a rocking chair are set before the 
hearth.  To one side of the cottage is an oaken table surround by four 
chairs.  A porcelain bowl sits in the middle of the table.  On the opposite 
side of the cottage is a bed covered with a flowery patterned quilt and 
large pillow.  Two glass lanterns rest on either end of the mantle, 
providing a gentle light to the cottage.  There is an entrance to the north.

    <desc>Flowers grow in profusion alongside the road, stately lupines towering over 
vermillion lilies and purple orchids.  Their scent fills the air and lingers 
over the pathway. In the distance, to the southeast, the pale pink Hogsmeade 
Inn can be seen nestled among its collection of vibrant flowers.  To the 
east another building can be glimpsed.  Southward lies more of Holly Avenue. 

The path also curves northwest.

    <desc>The inside of Dayflower Cottage is well-appointed, elegant despite it's 
humble size. The dark wooden slats of the floor shine with polish where they 
are not covered by a thick, wine-coloured rug. In the northwestern corner of 
the house, two heavy armchairs are clustered around a large window. They are 
upholstered in ivy-coloured damask, resplendent against the garnet-red 
walls. A small table is nestled between them, on which a curiously-bound 
tome lies. The tiny kitchen area is huddled in the southwestern corner, 
where copper cooking pots hang from the ceiling. Dried herbs, among them 
parsley and cilantro, are tied to hooks in the wall. A table, scarce able to 
seat three people comfortably, nevertheless has four chairs set around it in 
haphazard fashion. The sleeping area stretches along the eastern wall. A 
fireplace, empty of any blaze, sits echoing in the corner. A heavy wooden 
bed, carved with runes, takes up most of the wall. Atop it lie sheets of 
red, green, and gold-sewn jacquard. Paintings, primarily of mountain and 
forest scenes, adorn the walls. To the west lies the exit.

      <desc>The cover of this peculiar book seems to be composed of gold. It is set with 
gems that are easily identifiable as valuable: sapphires, emeralds, 
moonstones, agates, opals, and many others. There is no title, and the pages 
are yellowed and thin, obviously time- and care-worn.

seen as winged boars, which mark the entrance to Hogwarts castle.

    <desc>This hill treats those who find it to a breathtaking view overlooking the 
extensive lake, its water smooth and glass-like, and giving an excellent 
view of the colossal Hogwarts castle sitting upon a cliff across the lake.  
Farther into the distance lays a vast expanse of forest, seemingly going on 
for miles.  Mountains rise up in the distance, surrounding the area.  The 
vast towers of Hogwarts seem to penetrate the sky and the large &quot;Great Hall&quot; 
can be seen clearly.  Near the center of the hill, a large oak tree shades 
some of the area.  To the northwest a short trail leads back onto &quot;The High 
Street&quot; in Hogsmeade.

There is one window to the north.  The glass pane is missing from the 
window.  Cobwebs and spiders have made their homes in cracks, in the bare, 
stone, walls.  Specialised in brooms, this shop offers something for 
everyone in any price range.  There is a 'shut for business' sign by the 
window.  One magic brown is sweeping the floor on its own, creating clouds 
of dust.  Go down to exit this shop.

the southeast into a village.  Along the path are aging trees, at some 
points reaching across the path to block the sky from vision.  Up in the 
trees are several squirrels climbing the many limbs, chittering softly.

    <desc>Although very small, the room is tidy and looks nearly like a magical 
nursery.  Aside from a neat sofa, fit for sleeping, there are a few 
child-sized chairs and soft cushions, gathered in two circles around a 
larger armchair, fit for an adult.  On a small bookcase by its side are a 
few, well-chosen books, with brightly-coloured covers.  A beautiful 
chandelier with straight candles smelling of lavender sheds a peaceful light 
upon the clean, wooden floor.  The walls are made of wood, decorated only by 
garlands of ever-fresh flowers, with no windows.  Lavender and smoke mix 
thickly in the air in a perfumed, shimmering veil that embraces the ceiling, 
crowding around the stairs that lead downstairs, into Linellel's tiny shop.

      <desc>The low bookcase is filled with children's books, with subjects ranging from 
Muggle comedy to adventure and mystery stories.  A half-open drawer shows 
the wrappers of candy and pastries of the best Honeydukes quality, while a 
few unopened bottles of Marlene's Bubbly Delights stand nearby.

    <desc>The room is dingy and in complete disarray.  Just beneath the descending 
part of the rooftop, to the east, stands a wooden bed, practically buried 
amidst drawings of hat designs and useful spell books.  Unfinished models of 
hats are scattered over the small, round table that is in the centre of the 
squared chamber, while the great wooden shelves lining the walls are packed 
with boxes of all shapes and sizes.  The wooden floor is covered by a 
bright-pink rug, with green, geometric patterns.  Round, radish-shaped 
candles are always alight in a diminutive chandelier that hangs above the 
table; their light is focused on the area immediately below them, dimming 
away at greater distances.  A creaking, winding staircase leads downstairs, 
into Marillda's shop.

fixed in place.  Some still hold a few books, marking their original use as 
bookcases; however, most are now filled with boxes of various sizes, bearing 
small notes, such as: &quot;Madam Puddifoot; add Protection Charm against tea

    <desc>The creamy white, spacious room is decorated sparingly. High walls hold four large windows trimmed with dark green velvet curtains. Plaster of Paris demons, cherubs and gaping dragons look down from the once white ceiling. In the middle of the ceiling one of the dragons holds a metal chain in its mouth, from which a copper oil lamp hangs down. The creaking, wooden floor is lacking paint and lustre. A narrow staircase, missing a few steps, leads to the shop below.

    <desc>This spacious and inviting living quarter sits directly above Joplin's 
Parchment Shop.  On the wood-panelled, western wall, facing the street, two 
windows sit, allowing outside light to filter in.  A stone fireplace sits in 
the southeastern corner.  Between the 2 windows on the western wall, a bed 
sits on the hardwood floor.  Next to it is a nightstand with 3 drawers.  
Sitting in front of the fireplace is a brown leather sofa, adjacent to a 
small end table.  In the centre of the room a circular table, with 2 chairs, 
rests.  On the northern wall a counter and a sink make up the kitchen.  In 
the northeastern corner a door opens to a spiral staircase leading down into 
the shop.

 There are a handful of trees scattered over the area including birch, oak, 
willow, and elms.  Patches of grass grow here and there adding nice, bright

    <desc>In the warm months, a wonderful perfume of lilac and tulips is thick in the 
air, invading the pathway.  Clean of all but the most persistent weeds, the 
road runs from east to west, hitched up a small mound.  Two lampposts stand 
tall at the feet of the path, surrounded by happy flowers in all tinges 
imaginable.  The continuous buzzing in the air dies down only at nightfall, 
when it is replaced by cricket-orchestras, ceaselessly performing well-known 
arias.  A board is hanging from a knobbly, old oak on the south side of the 
lane.

a nut between its front paws and sniffing at the air.

pathway, their scent attractive to passing bumblebees. An occasional 
squirrel descends from one of the stately maple trees standing alongside the 
path to search for precious nuts. Three moss-covered rocks are huddled 
together at the base of one tree, a purple-blossomed wisteria vine slowly 
creeping up one of the stones. The pathway continues both towards the 
northeast and the southwest.

    <desc>A vine-choked tree looms just off the path, its branches dreary and weighted 
with leaves so dark they seem black. The vine itself seems to be thriving, 
having overtaken even the topmost limbs of the tree to enjoy whatever rays 
the sun might offer. Even amidst the peculiarly-coloured leaves of the vine,
it is obvious that the trunk of the tree has been marred by something. Only 
small, grim violets grow here, moisture clinging to their velvety surfaces. 
The road extends northwards and towards the southwest. Eastward is Founder's 
Street.

    <desc>The rumble of life is audible everywhere along the street.  Young trees are 
visible at every few feet, encased between squared walls standing ten inches 
high.  A small sign placed at the very entrance of the lane reads Founder's 
Street.  Small houses with red roofs catch the eye with their cheerfulness.  
Their carefully-tended front gardens perfume the air in fresh and sweet 
aromas.  To the west, Founder's Street joins a wider artery heading to the 
High Street.  This road continues eastwards.

    <desc>Red-berried hedges fence in the pathway, growing increasingly sparse as it 
winds southwards. A vine of some sort has established itself in the absence 
of the bushes, its tendrils creeping onto the pathway and towards the south. 
Tiny, bruise-coloured trilliums do their best to thrive in the shadow of the 
hedges and the vine. The road leads both northwards and southwards.

    <desc>Bluebells adorn the side of the pathway, their vibrant colour in stark 
contrast with the slightly brown grass. Crimson and gold geraniums add their 
hue to the scenery, their faces towards the sky. Low hedges march alongside 
the road, all dark green leaves and knotted wood. Some sport tiny, red 
berries. The dirt roadway stretches towards the northwest and the south. To 
the west lies Dove Lane.

    <desc>Shy, green blades of grass erupt from between the white cobblestones paving 
the road.  Great trees with strong trunks and shading, long branches bend 
obligingly over the road, above the few low benches.  In season, a soft 
carpet of leaves and small flowers covers the ground.  Two dark streetlights 
rise at the side of the lane, their heads bent sleepily.  To the east, the 
path meets a larger road, while to the west it plunges into a lonely, 
peaceful alley.

yellow fire flies.  A line of pebbles carefully laid out in the shape of a 
spiral is placed in the middle of this path.  In the middle of this spiral 
there is a bustling ants'nest.  The big ants are running back and forth in

 A bigger shiny black stone lies beneath an oak tree.

southeast to northwest.

    <desc>Alder trees stand solemnly here, and between them the rolling hills of the 
countryside can be seen. A variety of grasses grow at their feet, dotted 
with occasional flowers. In the shade beneath one of the white-limbed trees 
stands a peculiar ring of stones, all of them around a foot high and vaguely 
familiar looking. A plaque, brass and weatherworn, proclaims the ring's 
purpose. The pathway meanders both towards the southeast and the northwest.

    <desc>The trees spacing extends a tad as the dirt road widens. Through the open space, rolling, green, hills can be seen reaching into the distance. The dirt road itself is made of very compact dirt and rocks although several small potholes are scattered along the pathway. The edges of the road dip down to a shallow ditch to help in water drainage. The road extends to the southeast and the northwest.

    <desc>Spindly-limbed alder trees cluster along either side of the pathway, a 
veritable fence of leaves and limbs. Moss clings to their trunks, peculiar 
in that it is blue. The trees have not spread so far so as to prevent a view 
of the sky, although they begin to form an arch as the path continues 
northwards. The dirt road also curves southeast.

    <desc>Shadows dance in the spaces between the looming trees, clinging to their roots. In the gloom beneath the over-arching trees, creatures scuttle unobserved. The pathway is narrow, closed in by trees and sprawling, black-leaved bushes. It continues in this narrow fashion to the north, although southwards it widens.

    <desc>Grey trees hover, ghost-like, over the claustrophobic pathway, hemming 
passerby into an increasingly small area. The sky is difficult to see, as 
the tree limbs stretch across the road to meet their cousins, entangling in 
the centre. Noxious-looking plants grow at the feet of the trees, some 
sporting grim, drooping flowers. A dank pool, perhaps a remnant of a recent

The path here is very narrow. So narrow, in fact, that a single person can not walk through without rubbing their shoulders on the branches. The path is very dark here due to the fact it is so overgrown. The sounds of rodents and other small animals seem to echo off the surrounding woods and every so often a mouse can be seen scurrying across the path.

    <desc>The dirt path branches at this point.  A lonely path cuts eastward, through 
an old forest, while the main Hogsmeade road continues turning in gentle 
serpentines to the southwest and to the northeast.  What few trees line the 
dusty road are very old, vague reminders of a time when the forest used to 
cover this area entirely.  Since then, fresh, young grass and small bushes 
have grown at the feet of the trees, perfuming the air and brightening the 
view.  A distant rumble of life is audible almost perpetually, coming from 
the south.

    <desc>Sunlight bathes the lonely path, while the surrounding rosewood-and-oak 
forest is thin and aging.  A steady crackling of branches and leaves 
sometimes carries through to the road, but otherwise the way is peaceful and 
silent.  Gentle winds caress the well-trodden dirt path, occasionally 
raising fast-crumbling shapes of dust into the air.  The atmosphere is 
perfumed with the scent of fresh grass and trees.  A few small, red flowers 
timidly look upwards at the sky.  To the east, the forest thickens and grows 
steadily darker as it attempts to suffocate Willow Lane, while to the west, 
the path joins a larger Hogsmeade artery.

covered with jade-coloured moss. Hawthorn trees and ragged shrubs crowd 
behind it, a motley collection of foliage. Tall rain trees line the opposite 
end of the road, their brilliant golden flowers beckoning the weary traveler 
to smell them. The pathway, littered with fallen flowers from the rain 
trees, curves from northwest to southwest.

growing here. Tri-coloured wandflowers stretch their golden-ringed faces 
heavenwards, brightening the otherwise unrelieved stretch of green with 
their garish colour. A walnut tree spreads it's branches over the pathway, 
providing cover to passerby. The path extends northwest and southeast.

    <desc>Three spindly persimmon trees stretch skywards along the western side of the 
road, their boughs full of sparrows. Apricot-coloured flowers grow at the 
base of the trio of trees, hemmed in by luminous white stones, evidence of 
some human's touch. These same stones border the pathway in places, as if 
long ago they were an official boundary and time has since robbed them of 
their duty. The road and those stones that remain run southeast and 
northwest.

    <desc>A time worn fence is hardly visible here, lying as it is flat upon the 
ground. Wayward honeysuckle vines dominate the structure, in addition to 
five-petaled phlox flowers and stubborn ivy. Only the curiously carved 
lintels that once sat atop the fence slats are visible beneath the foliage. 
The path along which the fence once marched curves towards the southeast and 
extends into the west.

    <desc>The floor begins to switch its structure as large rocks carrying on due 
south collide with smaller pebbles that lead towards the north. The gaps 
between each rock is clean-cut as a dusty, sand-like substance takes heed in 
its small area. The ground is smoothly set, leveled perfectly with the rest 
of the path. Sets of trees line on both sides of the path heading north but 
seem to stop beside the end of the dank road. Many cottages sit neatly in a 
cul-de-sac at the end of Snitch End over in the south,surrounding a large 
circular area that holds a small stone figure.

    <desc>Pebbles are set strategically as the path of Snitch End, forming a twisting 
pattern, bringing a traveler's focus to the apex of the small court.  Placed 
in the centre of this cottage-guarded cul-de-sac is a statue of a wizened 
old wizard.  He overlooks the small cottages surrounding him, as a father 
might his children.  The same pebbles that form the foundation for this 
wizard's base can also be found as the path leading from the north, where 
the High Street leads to new destinations.  The cottages are positioned like 
soldiers around the statue, one at both the eastern and western points, as 
well as one at the northeastern and northwestern points, a single cottage 
defending the southern point against what lay beyond.  The northern point is 
left open in invitation to any and all travelers, trees towering toward the 
heavens in the distance, their peat floors packed tightly around their 
bases.

      <desc>The small, marble statue sits neatly on top of a stone pillar, it measures 
four feet high from the ground to the top of the statue. The statue is of a 
very old wizard. A white marble beard streams down the front of his solid 
robes as he holds one arm raised high clutching a wand. A set of holes are 
fixed at the top of the pillar with a much lighter shade of stone-grey 
shaped into a rectangle. The previous home to a plaque describing the 
statue.

    <desc>Upon entering the cottage one steps into a simple one roomed structure. It's 
dingy floors, and homely walls provide just enough space that the one-room 
cottage requires. Tucked into the southeastern corner is a modest bed, a 
homemade patchwork quilt making the matress look inviting for it's gracious 
owner. A good-sized fireplace takes up much of the western wall, the flames 
casting a warm and welcoming glow across the floor immediately in front of 
it. A small, square table with four proportionately small chairs stationed 
at each side takes up about three square feet of the room. The door is 
stationed at the northern point of the cottage, gently guiding to the street 
beyond.

    <desc>Brilliant blue phlox borders the dirt path, overtaking it in some areas. 
Heavy honeysuckle vines have overwhelmed the worn fence, their weight 
drawing it inexorably towards the ground. Various weeds and wildflowers 
struggle for life amongst the populous phlox. Scrawny bushes have had better 
success, although they have only coral-coloured berries to show for it. The 
pathway stretches towards both the east and west.

    <desc>This cottage is built slightly larger than the others that accompany it.  
Although empty of personal belonging, it holds furniture.  To the east a 
small bed is tucked into a small cutout of the wall surrounding the bed, as 
though the wall was built around the bed.  In the center of the western part 
of the cottage, a small circular dining table sits surrounded by 4 chairs.  
A large shelf towers to the ceiling on the northern wall, near the bed.  
Also contained by the northern wall, lying farther down than the shelf, 
directly north of the table, is a small stone fireplace, with a smooth, 
stone mantle.  On the eastern side of the southern wall lies a single wooden 
door, with a stone arch outlining the wood.

    <desc>The cottage has five rooms. The first is the living room that has an old, shabby couch and three arms chairs, all centered around a WWN. The room is lit by candles, which are spread through the area. The floor is wooden, and the room has a general dusty look to it. There is a bathroom in the back of the cottage, off the kitchen. The kitchen itself is large, and open to the dining room. The kitchen has the usual appliances, though no refrigerator. There is an out-of-place chandelier hanging from the ceiling. In the dining room there is a table for six, with only four chairs. There is a large window behind the table, and there are three torches in the room. There is a floor rug centered just under the table. Behind the dining room is a bedroom that looks as though it was put onto the house after it was built. There is a king-size bed and two twin beds. None of the blankets match. There are four candles in the room.

    <desc>The well worn, ancient stile rests against an old, hardwood fence, overgrown 
with weeds and moss.  A dirt path continues through the foliage to a 
mountainous area.  Daytime noise of fauna is abundant, changing to the 
pleasant chirping of frog and cricket as the night takes over.  Wild flowers 
give off a pleasant aroma and spread a bright splash of color upon the 
foliage along the dirt path to the east.

    <desc>A thicket of wild bushes crowds this section of Willow Lane.  The dirt path 
is severely narrowed, so that only one person might pass at a time.  At the 
sides of the road, the wild thicket breaks slightly around a few large 
trees, embracing their strong roots lovingly.  The air is thick with the 
scents of wild roses and damp oak.  Willow Lane continues to the west and to 
the northeast.

    <desc>Freshly-coloured blades of grass break through the narrow strip of road 
here, while stubborn thickets of wild berries take over from the rose-bushes 
that creep up from the east side of Willow Lane.  The strong, massive oaks 
in their midst slowly give way to pine trees, and even to some willows, by 
the side of a rapid-flowing stream.  The air here is sweet and refreshing.  
Willow Lane continues to the east and to the west.

    <desc>A small lake lies to the north of this part of the road.  Large thickets of 
berries fight a losing battle with the many willows growing here.  The air 
is thick with the sweet scents of damp willow and fresh water.  The 
dark-green of the berry-thickets is overwhelmed by fresh light-green, with a 
tinge of yellow.  The path is rather crowded by bushes towards the east, but 
it broadens as it goes west.  Willow Lane continues to the east and to the 
west of this point.

    <desc>A small, low, wooden bench is placed underneath a large oak, on the south 
side of the dirt path here.  There are two large stone baskets at either 
side of the bench, where a few tulips have been carefully planted and 
looked-after.  The north side of the road is a paradise of blooming, 
ever-moving willows.  Startling-white flowers look up from amidst the 
willows, surrounded by the vivid-green of thick grass.  The road continues 
to the east and to the west, along Willow Lane.

    <desc>.
The cottage is rather large for a cottage. There are three armchairs and a couch facing a black bricked fireplace. The furniture has green slipcovers and everything looks very new. The rug is white and absolutely spotless. In the far right corner is a studio-style kitchen. On the floor, neatly rolled, are two small blankets in the same shade of green as the furniture. It is clear these blankets serve as beds for the house-elves. In the corner, opposite the kitchen, sits a long wooden table. The table's legs are painted green like the slipcovers, though the top is cherry-wood. Around the table sit four green chairs and the table is set. There is only one door, and it leads southwest to the garden.

    <desc>The lone way called Willow Lane cuts through a thicket of trees.  At the 
sides of the road, charred remains show where oaks and willows attempted to 
conquer the path.  The lane is desolate, with sharp winds hissing through 
the remainder of the forest on either side of the path.  The trees grow 
almost on each other's roots, their dark-green boughs uniting in a waving, 
unsteady ceiling.  Even above Willow Lane, they throw their long arms at 
each other in a protective embrace that limits sunlight.  The winds grow 
steadily more savage as they attack the eastern continuation of the Lane.  
However, to the west the thicket of trees is thinning and a dazzling 
brightness foretells a clearing.

    <desc>A savage wind blows through this part of the road.  What few trees still 
remain here are twisted and bent in fantastic shapes, their strong trunks 
knotted and crumpled.  Small, dark-coloured grass grows around their strong 
roots, where it is sheltered from the ever-hissing wind.  The path branches 
out to the south here, underneath the outskirts of a rosewood forest.  A 
light-brown gate is just visible through the thick patch trees, belonging 
probably to some sort of garden.  Willow Lane continues east and west of 
here.

      <desc>The trees south of Willow Lane are huddled together, as if they intentionally protect each other from the fierce winds. As a consequence, they are less twisted and bent than their northern neighbours. A path leads right underneath their boughs towards a white gate.

    <desc>A high, circular, white fence and a white gate separate the Mill Garden from 
the rosewood forest surrounding it.  Wild and in complete disarray, the 
garden is not the most tasteful or beautiful of places.  Weeds and ivy crawl 
up the wooden fence and down upon the ground, entangling and suffocating 
thin or frail plants.  The few colourful bushes with thorns sharp enough to 
have pierced the savage tentacles raise triumphant, pink and white faces 
towards the sky.  The entire garden is shaded by rosewood and oak trees.  A 
house and a mill are visible to the south, while the garden gate lies north.

    <desc>Small and derelict, the Mill House is covered in an inch of dust.  The rough 
table in the centre of the room has one leg shorter than the others.  The 
faintest of breezes makes it creak its protests loudly, wobbling back and 
forth.  A single, rickety chair, with a few dirty clothes piled on it, 
stands about fifteen feet away from the table.  Along the south wall is a 
small sofa, covered in dirty rags that might be considered blankets.  Next 
to the bed, there is a large cupboard.  A radish-shaped candle is hanging in 
a small chandelier above the table.  The door to the cottage lies north.  A 
small side-exit on the eastern side of the cottage leads to the nearby Mill.

    <desc>This section of Willow Lane is dusty and covered with leaves.  On the north 
side of the path two linden trees have grown very close to one another, 
amidst grass and bushes.  Even when there is no wind, these two trees keep 
launching at each other, poking and slamming with long, thick fingers.  A 
rosewood forest spreads by the south side of the road, their thick scent 
making the air dense with perfume.  The lane continues to the east and west 
of this point.

      <desc>These two linden look battered beyond their age.  Deep scratches line the 
upper half of their barks, while many twigs and small branches are broken or 
snapped three-quarters through.  There is less than an inch separating the 
trunks of these trees all the way up to their crowns.  At some point during 
their continuous battle, some of their larger branches have grown around 
each other, restricting their movement.

    <desc>.
Very different from most trails, this path seems the ideal location for a garden. Along either side are many tulips in varying colours. A river can be heard nearby, but is hidden from view. Whether due to instinct or charm work the animals of Hogsmeade seem to avoid this area. Even the owls are absent overhead, perhaps preferring to a take a longer route. There are no trees here and the path leads southeast and northwest.

    <desc>Situated on the apex of a small hill, this part of the road looks 
well-tended and clean.  A few linden trees, surrounded by flowers and 
elegantly-trimmed bushes, stand by the southeastern and southwestern sides 
of the path.  A small, wooden marker pointing north reads 'Thimble Cottage'. 
 A small post-box is placed some two feet beneath the marker.  Wide, clean 
paths lead northwest and northeast, along Willow Lane.

    <desc>A low, elegant, white fence with a four-foot tall arched gate surrounds this 
perfumed and very tidy garden.  A well-tended cobblestone path runs from the 
gate to the front door of a handsome cottage.  On the eastern side of the 
cobblestone path, a grass carpet stretches beneath trees and multicoloured 
bushes.  A few fallen apples signal the presence of the low, perfumed 
apple-trees, arranged in rows in the northeastern section of the garden.  
The western side of the cobblestone path houses vegetable patches of all 
sorts.  A few happy tomatoes, surrounded by carrots and radishes, grin from 
their low stances above the dark soil.  The fresh scents of earth and grass 
mixes with the sweetness of the apple-trees into an irresistible aroma.  The 
arched gate of the garden stands to the south, while the cottage rises to 
the north.

      <desc>This peaceful-looking cottage is entirely made of dark-red wood.  The brown 
front door has two small, diamond-shaped windows: one at about the height of 
a grown man and another just high enough for a young child to peer through.  
The two front windows, placed symmetrically on either side of the door, are 
moderately large.  Two small trays, filled with flower pots, are hanging 
beneath these windows.  The flowers, in fierce tones of red mixed with 
calmer pink and lovely white, give the impression of a happy and rich life 
inside the cottage.  A wooden imitation of a crown of flowers hangs above 
the cottage door.  Golden letters spell the name Thimble just beneath this 
crown.  A chimney rises on the western side of the cottage, like an odd pipe 
permanently puffing ringlets of smoke.

    <desc>The inside of this cottage is cheerful and tidy.  Two small beds are perched 
above each other along the eastern wall, while a larger, one-person bed 
lines the northern wall.  A small, four-person table stands towards the 
northern side of the cottage, surrounded by four chairs, three of which are 
decorated merrily with flowers and small carvings of birds.  A stove and 
some necessary cutlery are stored on the western side of the chamber.  Some 
ten feet away from the stove, there is a magnificent fireplace, with a 
merrily-crackling fire.  A few candles line the walls, lighting by 
themselves at nightfall.  The light from the two medium-sized windows on the 
southern wall reaches out in all directions, leaving no corner of the room 
in darkness.  Two bookcases stand along the eastern wall, some five feet 
away from the two small beds.  A soft carpet, with a red background and a 
geometric pattern, covers the entire floor.  Three pairs of slippers are 
placed in a tiny shoe-rack in the southwestern corner of the room.  The door 
to this lovely cottage lies to the south.

small, black leather bag of Floo Powder hangs on one side of the fireplace.  
The many thick, wooden logs in the fire keep it burning boldly and brightly.

part of the road.  Their long, thin fingers caress the ground in lazy, 
sweeping motions that come and go with the wind.  The south side of the path 
is, by contrast, guarded by strong oaks in the prime of their lives.  Their 
strong trunks are straight as they proudly reach out towards the sky.  Grass 
and flowers grow at both sides of the road, also covering the Hogsmeade path 
in random patterns of green, white, and brown.  Willow Lane continues to the 
east and to the west of this point.

    <desc>Willow Lane is covered here entirely by low grass.  A few benches are placed 
underneath the few oaks that line its southern side, while the willows on 
the north side of the road are surrounded by smaller bushes of roses or 
berries.  The air is fresh and rich in sweet aromas and a few squirrels can 
be heard making their way around the great oak trees.  The path continues to 
the east and to the west.

    <desc>Both sides of the road are lined with wild rose-bushes and berry thickets.  
A few pine trees appear behind these bushes on the south side of the road, 
while a few solitary willows moan gently on the north side.  The path is 
lined with grass, but a faint trace of brown is visible beneath the blades.  
Many pairs of feet have walked across this path, leaving the grass bent and 
rare.  A small break is visible amongst the berry bushes on the north side 
of the road.  Willow Lane continues east and west.

    <desc>A savage wind beats in this part of the road.  Any grass on the dirt path is 
flattened so as to present as small a target as possible to the torrents of 
air.  A few, crooked, pine trees line both sides of the path, their branches 
growing in strange places along their trunks.  There are markings on some of 
their bark.  A small message is written on a stone sign, placed low in the 
grass in front of the line of trees.  A thicket of berries stands between 
the trees, having resisted the fierce winds.  Their small branches are 
bent in tortured, supplicating positions.  The road continues east and 
west, along Willow Lane.

      <desc>The pine trees lining the road in this part of Willow Lane are marked with

S.  The writing has been done by a strong hand, and the markings are more

born 1921, dead 1945.  He killed himself on the night that he found the Dark 
Mark hovering above the bodies of his wife, Elizabeth, and his two children, 
Rabastan (3) and Lazarus (2).  I have cursed this place so it shall evermore

    <desc>A small branching of Willow Lane leads north here, towards a bright, 
peaceful garden.  The road has been swept carefully and any twigs or bird 
droppings vanish every few minutes.  The eastern part of the path is wild 
and dark, and winds blow through it frequently, as if attracted to it.  
Tormented trees in bent, painful positions reach out sideways over the road, 
shading it from the sun.  To the west, the road is peaceful and very 
beautiful, with willows rising on both sides of the road, amidst fresh grass 
and white and yellow flowers.  Willow Lane continues to the east and west of 
this point.

    <desc>This section of the road is peaceful, with willows bending above it on both 
sides.  Fresh, light-green grass happily grows all around the roots of the 
willows, littered with white daffodils.  A couple of benches on either side 
of the path offer a place of rest, though most use it for contemplation.  
The air is thick with the sweet perfume of flowers and dry willows.  To the 
east of this point, the dirt path passes in front of the Whispering Well 
cottage.  Willow Lane continues to the west.

    <desc>A thick fog permanently hovers over the willows in this section of the 
world.  It is as if the wilting branches of the damp trees are attracting 
the thick haze to them.  There are no flowers here.  The path is cut by a 
blackened scar that runs through the middle of the road.  A small sign lies 
by the side of the road, caught amidst rough, thorny weeds.  Willow Lane 
continues to the east and west of this point.

Its many branches hold loads of crimson apples, ready for picking.  The soil 
below supports not only grass but also a small vegetable garden.  It has 
been neatly planted in rows, the sprouting plants placed evenly apart.  On 
the other side of the tree an ancient-looking well plays host to creeping 
vines.  Crumbling stones hold up the structure below a mossy wooden bucket.  
A small plaque has been affixed to the well.  A small cottage is to the 
south and Willow Lane is to the north.

fallen to the street, near the walls.  The grimy windows appear not to have 
been cleaned for ages, as years of dust and dirt are caked in the frames.  
Wilting and dead flowers are all that remain of the sad little garden 
beneath the windows.  The parched soil the plants once resided in cries out 
for water.  A strange, goat-like is faint in the air.  The dusty road goes 
on past this house to the north and south.

    <desc>This cottage is very tidy, comprising all the essentials of life.  A 
comfortable, moderately-sized bed is on the northern side, beneath a single, 
large window.  On either side of the window, there are green, thick 
curtains.  The light from this single window spreads in the entire home.  A 
large dish-cupboard stands along the eastern wall, with a large potted plant 
nearby.  A table suitable for four persons, and made of sturdy oak, is in 
the centre of the room, with matching oak chairs.  The oven, in the 
south-eastern corner of the chamber, has a few cooking-pans on it, all clean 
and ready to be used.  A sink resides on the south wall, next to the overn.  
A single bookcase is placed on the western wall, filled mostly with 
household-related books, about cooking, cleaning, and gardening.  Next to 
the bookcase, there is a small, wooden desk, with a rather old, but clean 
eagle-feather quill lying next to a sheet of new paper.  The cage of an owl 
is hanging down from the ceiling, by the bedside.  Two small, spherical 
lights are placed in great glass bowls, one on the east and another on the 
west wall.  The exit of the cottage lies south.

      <desc>This plant looks like a small palm-tree, with vigorous branches extending 
upwards, bearing large leaves at their ends.  A small note on the pot reads: 
&quot;The Desdemona Magica, also known as the Whispering Well, originates in 
South America, and is well known for its night-time whispers, which resemble 
human speech.  This plant banishes bad dreams and its leaves can be grinded 
into a liquid to soothe agitation.  It is also a component of the well-known 
Draught of Peace.&quot;

    <desc>This decrepit cottage has seen more than its fair share of years.  The dust 
covers everything in a thick blanket, the slightest movement sends herds of 
dust-bunnies scrambling through the dim light.  A table, with a few broken 
chairs, stands in the corner next to a large, long bed.  The sheets have not 
been changed in years.  The generous layer of dust on the stone floor hides 
many piles of goat droppings from view.  Lanterns hang along the walls but 
only a tiny fraction of their light penetrates through the thick grime that 
covers them.  To the east is the large, wooden door.

building.  A strange smell, maybe of goats, seems to come from it.  Above 
the door is a sign showing a severed boar's head leaking blood onto the 
white cloth underneath.  To the north is a thick, impenetrable wall of trees 
and brush.  To the south the street continues.

    <desc>This bar appears not to have been cleaned for ages.  A thick blanket of dust 
covers the floor, piling up in the corners.  Along the far wall is a grubby 
bar, about as clean as the floor, and some dilapidated barstools with 
varying numbers of legs.  It is dark and dingy here.  Only a sputtering 
torch and a small, grimy window provide any light to this dismal, shady 
place.  Cobwebs lace the flaking ceiling.  On the bar a few empty bottles 
stand, encrusted with filth.  A small fire blazes in the furnace, keeping 
the place reasonably warm.  Some of the nicer barstools have been pulled 
around the flame as an inviting sitting spot, if any area in this bar could 
be considered welcoming.  Out west is the road.

    <desc>This small garden is made up entirely of old trees: mostly oaks and pines.  
A small rivulet runs across the east side of the garden where a couple of 
willows stand.  The carpet of grass is soft and beautiful, the bright green 
of the blades mixing with occasional wild flowers.  A high fence has been 
built around this small park, with a rickety gate on the north side, leading 
towards the main Hogsmeade dirt path.  There is no set road between this 
gate and the front door of the cave-like cottage to the south.  The park is 
silent generally, but every sound in it is rich and mysterious.

    <desc>The inside of this cottage resembles a cave.  The ceiling, which is rather 
high at the entrance, descends rapidly until it's no higher than four feet 
at the southernmost point.  The southern wall is rounded in a sharp, 
ellipsoidal shape.  A table with a few chairs, a small bookcase, and a 
cutlery cupboard are all crowded by the door, along with a number of pans 
and pots of various sizes.  A small bed resides more to the south.  There is 
moss growing on the stone floor and the air is damp.  In the middle of the 
chamber a few stones have been used to build some sort of primitive oven.  
There is, however, no proper door to this device and the fire sometimes 
licks the outer walls, leaving darkened bruises.  Next to the bed is a large 
basket with the best blankets making a bed for some sort of large pet.  
There are two small windows, on either side of the door, allowing very 
little light inside.  Along the walls are a few, primitive, wooden torches 
caught in chain-like brackets.  The entrance to this cottage lies to the 
north.

    <desc>. A candelabra holding three everlasting candles lights this small and unkept room. Patches of moist, green mold decorate the cracked walls. The fireplace is black and smothered with the remains of burnt wood, filling the entire room in a mist of black dust. A faint red rug covers most of the bare stone floor and harbours a family of grey codling moths. Red wooden shutters cover the only two small windows in the room. A wooden single bed is placed against a wall, accompanied by a small oil lamp. There is a wooden door to the north.

    <desc>The walls are made of dry, clean pine wood and each corner is tapered into a 
smooth bend.  A triple-layered candelabrum, filled with mauve candles that 
emit soothing scents of lavender, hangs down from a pyramidal-shaped, 
slanted roof.  Covered by a red, woollen rug, the floor is wooden and a 
little bumpy, as though palm-sized buttons rested at odd intervals upon it.  
A single, squared window stands to the east, providing a beautiful view of 
the cobblestone path below.  Impersonal, but clean, and dry, the chamber is 
furnished by a desk, a wardrobe, and a wooden bed.  A discrete staircase 
leads down into the lobby of the Two Hoots Inn.

but rather plain-looking chair is neatly tucked underneath it.  Upon the 
table top are the necessary utensils for writing: parchment, a 
dove-feathered quill, and black ink.  The surface of this piece of furniture 
is smooth and without splinters, although some of its dark-brown paint has 
rubbed off with wear.

although it is not large enough to hide the numerous scratches on the wooden 
frame.  Time has rounded some of the bed's corners and edges, making the 
surface smoother, although less elegant.

the window is worn by time and scarred in places, as though by fingernails, 
but the surface is tolerably smooth.

carrying a brown envelope in its beak.  The bird drops the envelope on the 
ground.  A squirrel, coming from the west, runs off with the envelope 
leaving behind a trail of red beans that are spilling from the envelope.  
Under one of the four, tall posts, with everlasting gas lamps attached to 
them, a wooden sign is hammered into the dirt.  The sign shows a white 
painted arrow pointing to the east.  This track continues to the east and 
west.

The path is very wide here. The dirt is a little muddy and there are quite a few rocks poking out in the path. To the right there is a rather vicious looking group of human-like animals with wings. There is a shimmering purple light coming from a bush to the left. The path is so quiet it is almost eerie. On the left side, where the path turns southwest, there is a wooden sign hanging. The path leads east and southwest.

The dirt on this road is not packed down, appearing as if it is hardly traveled upon. To the left a stream flows quite rapidly. Every ten feet there are lamps floating on either side of the road, unaided by any visible object. To the right great pine trees reach nearly one-hundred feet. The only flowers are a few daisies growing by the water. The path continues west on Willow Lane, east to the Laurels Garden, and southeast to the Snicket.

Through the centre of the garden is a wooden pathway, which acts as a bridge over the small stream flowing horizontally to the cottage. The left side is predominantly taken up by bushes. The bushes have flowers in shades of pale pinks, blues and purples. The flowers each have unique shapes, some shaped as hearts, others as stars, and even some as squiggly circles. To the right there is a golden sundial. There is no grass on the right side; instead, small white rocks cover the earth. A very small tree - barely four feet - finds its home in the corner of the garden. Placed every six feet are gas lamps atop gold posts. The wooden path leads northeast to the Laurels Cottage and west to Willow Lane.

    <desc>. The bendy track swerves from left to right, around giant trees.  Every tree 
trunk has an everlasting gas lamp attached to it.  A thin ring of mist 
surrounds every tree.  To the east a fog is building up.  Silvery grey 
clouds roll over the ground and every now and then a tiny flash of light 
jumps up in a vertical line from these clouds.  The track continues to the 
east and west.

    <desc>This narrow paved road continues to the south and to the north.  To the 
north the road eventually leads to &quot;The High Street&quot; in Hogsmeade.  A short, 
white, picket fence surrounds the small yard in front of the empty cottage 
to the west, while a short stone wall protects the lawn of a well-kept, 
small cottage to the east.  A lantern rests on the eastern side of the road, 
in front of the rough, stone wall.  To the south the road continues to lead 
to more buildings.

    <desc>The beautiful cobblestone pattern of the street goes around a large, round, 
stone basin filled with grass and scarlet flowers.  A white, brick wall, 
about five feet in height, stands to the east, decorated with curling ivy of 
a bright-green colour.  Elderly, perfumed, linden trees border the lane on 
both sides, providing a measure of shade and shelter.  Proudly standing on 
the western side of the road is a magnificent house, with a large sign 
hanging on it, spelling in golden letters upon a dark-brown background 
&quot;Benterthorn's Real Estate&quot;.  A few flies are buzzing around the eastern 
wall, like scant spots of red upon an otherwise peaceful, blue-coloured 
background.  The scent of linden leaves is thick and sweet in the 
surrounding air.  The lane stops a few feet to the south into a dead end, 
while to the north, the tidy road leads into a burst of light and life on 
the High Street.

      <desc>Twirling and spiralling in elegant patterns, the ivy expands at a moderate 
pace across the stone wall, caressing it with long, soft fingers.  The plant 
appears very vivacious and moderately-old, its bright-green leaves catching 
any natural light.  It grows thickly all around the edges of the brick 
barrier, lavishly erupting from the other side of the wall, as if from a 
balcony.

    <desc>The handsome cobblestone passage ends smoothly to the south in a white, 
stone wall, covered in thick ivy.  Protected and shaded by beautiful, linden 
trees, the street is wide and clean, filled with sweet aromas that hang 
thickly in the surrounding air.  A large, modern building stands to the 
eastern side of the road, preceded by a paved porch.  To the west is an 
old-fashioned, cosy inn, with a large wooden owl perched on its roof, 
holding a board.  White letters on a brown background spell out the words: 
&quot;At the Two Hoots.&quot;  The atmosphere is relaxed and very warm, with insects 
gently humming happy tunes while they go about their chores.  To the north, 
the lane patiently goes on through a remarkably well-tended pathway that 
leads to the High Street.

with lots of white and mauve flowers.  The owl statue on the rooftop holds a 
sign reading: &quot;At the Two Hoots&quot;.

windows and ripped, filthy curtains provide the only source of light in this 
otherwise dark and dingy space.  To the north, yellowing wallpaper torn from 
the walls is piled in dust-covered heaps on the stained, bare floor.  To the 
northeastern corner lies a table, smashed in two and surrounded by the 
remains of demolished chairs.  Everything is choked in enormous, billowing 
cobwebs.  Eddies of dust caught in a cold draft swirl along the western wall 
where there sits an old slashed sofa, spilling stuffing from its seats.  The 
ancient foundations of the building creak and sigh in the wind like an old

    <desc>The boards that were once nailed across the far western window of this 
landing have since rotted off, allowing light from the outside to spill in.  
To one side, surrounding the top of the stairwell, stands an unsteady, 
wooden banister with many of its supporting balusters smashed through or 
ripped from their positions.  A long rug, now threadbare and filthy, 
stretches from one end of the landing to the other.  Locked doors, scarred 
with deep slashes, are positioned to the south and east.  Ahead, to the 
north, a door has been ripped entirely from its hinges and lies on the floor 
amidst a sea of splinters.

    <desc>A once magnificent, four-poster bed to the east takes up much of the space 
in this medium-sized bedroom.  A large, grime-stained, dusty window along 
the western wall lets in enough natural light to highlight the faded pattern 
on the bed's dusty, ripped hangings.  A moth-eaten and torn bedspread hangs 
off the stained, slashed mattress and on to the filthy, wooden floorboards.  
To the west, a toppled writing desk with only three remaining legs sits 
amidst an expanse of half-smashed drawers and stains from now empty ink 
pots.  To the south lies an exit on to the landing.

    <desc>A cosy fireplace sits in the far northwestern corner of this Inn.  To the 
west of the door stands a bar.  Its long surface, made of a strong wood, has 
several stools placed in front of it.  Towards the middle of the Inn, 
scattered tables and chairs dot the floor.  To the east of the door, several 
private booths are nestled next to the wall.  Several, wooden beams support 
the ceiling overhead, as it reaches a peak in the centre.  The floor is made 
of a worn, darkish-coloured wood.  The air holds a misty, multi-coloured 
haze of pipe smoke.  Light is coming from the many lamps that are placed on 
the walls.  A small, wooden door, the exit to the Inn, stands to the 
southeast.

This shop has eight small black booths. In the back are three very large booths, made of black and lined with velvet. Residing in each booth is one pair of large, black headphones and long, thin, black wire with a small disc on the end the size of a knut. The disc is magically charmed to record everything, and when hooked up to a WWN, then recorded sound plays back. The large booths have eight of these, and eight pairs of headphones. All along the walls are records of famous musicians who made their first recordings in Alana's.

    <desc>. This small and brightly decorated room has windows to the east, north and south. A wall-filling wooden bookcase is propped up against the north wall. It sighs under the heavy weight of as many richly decorated books as it can carry. A colourful, everlasting  bunch of red, green and yellow flowers stands on a small, round table in the middle of the room. The flowerheads harbour tiny, smiling faces. Next to the window to the north hangs a portrait of a woman, a friendly, pretty face framed by lush, dark curls. To the east there is a small cabinet made of flaming red wood. It is heavily decorated and behind the glass windows in the two cabinet doors, stand a few glass bottles. One of the bottles emanates a pulsating, glowing, red light. There is a door to the west.

    <desc>This path is very narrow. To the east there are large, crestfallen Oak 
trees. The branches from these trees hang over the path as if the tree is 
simply too tired to grow upright. Living amongst the trees are strange 
creatures which look like a cross between a caterpillar and a hermit crab. 
Although the Oak trees on this path are infested with the peculiar 
creatures, there are none to the north or south, almost as if they are 
waiting for something. To the west lies a small, green building. Atop the 
building a huge, white sign.

    <desc>Inlaid in the cobbled stones of the street is an exquisite mosaic, depicting 
a map of the world. The entire bejeweled spectacle glints on even the 
darkest of days. Two bronze plaques, burnished to a high sheen, are set 
into the pathway on either side of the mosaic, so that they may be read by 
passerby coming from either direction. A shop entrance stands to the west, 
well-kept and clean. The building itself is constructed of grey stone, and 
the door is heavily carved metal. Two tall poplar trees stand sentry at 
either side of the entry on marble plinths. Blossom Street stretches north 
and south.

    <desc>Although apparently well-tended, the cobblestones that pave the road are 
rounded and worn around the edges.  Weeds are slowly creeping up between 
them, pushing insistently with thorny fingers that are partly surrounded by 
thin webs of ivy.  A house fallen into disrepair stands to the east, while 
to the west is a little shop with a sign reading &quot;One Stop Quidditch&quot;.  A 
set of brooms lies on the ground.  The narrow street becomes dirtier as it 
goes on to the north.  To the south, a clean lane leads towards the luminous 
High Street.

      <desc>The five broomsticks look well-worked and shabby.  Their wooden tails are 
splintered in many places and a fair proportion of their soft twigs is 
broken.  Lying sprawled on top of each other in a large heap, they move of 
their own will, as if sighing.  Although they sometimes push against each 
other, discontentedly, the brooms appear much too tired to snap more 
forcefully.

      <desc>The wooden house looks in ruins, its windows heavily boarded from the 
outside.  Its door is heavily scarred and patches of black paint have faded 
off with the passage of time.  A small, dark, weed-strewn garden lies at the 
feet of the building, giving out repulsive smells of rot and dried mud.  
Insects swarm around it during the day, while frogs invade it during the 
night, protesting in low voices.

      <desc>The shop is preceded by a small wooden porch.  A small sign, hanging above a 
large front window reads &quot;One Stop Quidditch - Catch them before they fly!&quot;  
Although the building is small, it looks clean and well-tended.  Through the 
front window, a rack filled with Bludgers, Snitches and Beater Bats can be 
vaguely seen.

    <desc>Thick, dark-green vines spread all over the old, broken, cobblestone path, 
reaching up to the wall that borders the street on the western side.  Musky, 
damp smells erupt from the many visible gaps in the street, where 
foul-looking, bluish-brown plants squelch and burp constantly.  A twisted, 
pained-looking oak grows at the roadside.  To the east, a well-tended garden 
precedes a wooden cottage whose windows are illuminated by warm candlelight. 
 To the north stretches the very dingy end of the street, while the southern 
path is brighter, leading ultimately into the High Street.

      <desc>Bluish-green plants have filled the gaps in the pavement, like so many 
throbbing, swollen tumours.  Their chubby leaves, covered in a slimy, 
dark-grey gel, crawl hungrily against the cobblestones closest to them.  
Small excrescences all over their surface, looking like angry, black boils, 
break every so often with squelching noises into mud-coloured flowers with 
thick, waxy petals.

      <desc>The tree is twisted and contorted, bent low above the pavement, as if in 
supplication, its old body scarred and tormented by old age and nature's 
caprices.  Long branches stretch over the pathway, every one of them bent 
like the previous one, as though an intense blast of wind had irrevocably 
blown it to this unnatural stance.  Knots and deep wounds extend to every 
inch of the oak's bark.  Leafless and dark-coloured, as if burnt, the tree 
moans and creaks at every breeze.

happily, shimmering with an intrinsic, warm glow, reminiscent of 
candlelight.  The house is painted mahogany-red, with a dark-brown door and 
white window ledges.  A permanent, thin mist that looks like a see-through 
veil hovers around it, gracefully.

    <desc>The cobblestones paving the road have nearly completely disappeared, broken 
and eaten away by time and weeds.  Thick, snake-like vines of ivy crawl down 
the large wall that closes the alleyway to the north and to the east.  
Musky, damp smells of rot and decay hang heavily in the air, attracting 
insects and scavengers.  Weeds infest the entire area, growing in thorny, 
flowerless hedges that creak and snap of their own will.  To the west stands 
a moderately-sized, wooden shop, while to the south the lane clears steadily 
as it goes on to meet the High Street of Hogsmeade.

      <desc>Black, opaque ivy spreads like the webs of a gigantic spider, covering the 
large wall to the north and to the east and most of the cobblestone street.  
The plant squelches and throbs as it slithers lazily in all directions, 
attempting to conquer as much space as it possibly can.  Its leaves are 
large and elongated, with sharp tips, with thorns sticking out at the 
junction with the vine.

the bottom; its edges are rounded and smooth.

are small and of an unwholesome, dark-brown, murky colour that attracts 
light without reflecting it.  The temperamental plants snap at nearby 
insects or at each other in conflicts which sometimes end in painful cracks 
and moans.

The shop is packed with Quidditch gear. Tall, brown shelves hold everything from snitches to protective armour to Bludger-sized candies. There is a large, open area in the rear of the store for testing out brooms before buying them. The ceiling is wooden and sloped upward toward the middle. The shop is lit by torches, which hang on every wall. The only exit is east.

The store is one room with many tables. On each table is a map, and lining the southern wall is a large chart. The chart has a name of a place and a number. On the western wall are cubbies with numbers on top of each cubbyhole, and a map under each number. The shop is lit by blue flames sparkling from behind glass containers set every few feet along the walls. There is a sign on the counter, next to the register. The only exit is east to Blossom street.

If you're leaving for a holiday
And need to find a place to stay
Or just want something to hang in your study
So you can look smart for your buddy
Then you came to the right place, old chap
Look around and buy yourself a map!

The office is large. The sign on desk is across from the door and behind it sits a witch in white robes. She is going through some complicated-looking medical charts. The waiting room floor is stark white and the many chairs are black. There is a large, many panelled window on one side. There are healers walking about, talking to owners, and are dressed in teal robes. The office is quite big, though amazingly clean. There is one door and it leads east.

    <desc>This charming cottage is lit entirely by hundreds of floating candles.  In 
here the smooth, hard pine floor is immaculately clean, without a speck of 
dust.  The soft, yellow light from the candles fills up every corner of the 
room.  Along the southern wall is a small bunk bed, which has blue sheets.  
Opposite of that is a large plate glass window that offers an excellent view 
of the large, varied garden outside.  A small kitchen lies in the eastern 
portion of this room.  The exit is to the west.

The cottage is a shabby one, at best. It is only one, creaky, grimy room. There is a blanket and a pillow in the far corner, presumably used as a bed for the owner. There is no fireplace, no rug and no kitchen. The ceiling is littered with cobwebs and the floor is so filthy is could be made of dirt. Each of the six windows is boarded and a lone candle sits in the middle of the room.

three directions: north, west, and southeast.  Many trees and shrubs line 
this area on the hill, but none compare in size to a huge maple tree to the

west a small teashop is visible, while to the southeast is a garden.

      <desc>This scarred tree serves as a marker for all the couples who have sat under 
this tree.  Names of hundreds of couples, by now long forgotten, are 
scrawled all over the tree, leaving barely any of the bark unmarked.  
Peering closer, individual names start to become visible in the thick bark.  
Dana and Joe...  Hermione and Ron...  Tina and Dark...  These are just a few 
of the many names found here.

 Directly opposite the door is a bar which curves to the side. The bar has a gold lining, and is made of dark oakwood. There are no barstools at the bar, and it appears to be there just to check on your order or else for decouration. To the right there are many two-person tables. For chairs there are squishy poufs and comfy armchairs of all colors. There are shining orbs floating a few inches off each table, covering the table in a pale light of either pink or red. There is a cherub floating around the place, throwing glitter in people's hair and all along the floor. There are a few couples seated at various tables in the pub. There is only one door and it leads east.

    <desc>Stone cherubim and pink petals dominate this garden.  At the centre is a 
small fountain decorated with little cupids.  A vine curls around the base 
and dips a leaf or two into the constantly moving surface of the water.  
Water dribbles from the lips of a cherub perched atop the fountain, hitting 
the pool below and sending ripples through it.  Along the edges of the 
garden are well-trimmed rosebushes, each covered in pink roses.  Soft petals 
have piled up beneath the bushes.  Other roses, in blood red, snow white or 
pale pink, grow in the garden as well.  Cherubs rest among the roses.  They 
seem to be the primary decoration here.  White stepping stones make a short 
path from the cottage to the south, to the road to the northwest.

    <desc>A big, white stove is placed against a wall to the south. Above it, metal chains, that drip from the ceiling, hold racks full of dangling pots, pans, and spoons. A small fireplace displays a crackling fire, releasing the sweet smell of vanilla. Above the fire, hanging from a chain, is a whistling kettle attached to the very top of a metal tripod and perched over the flames. A fluffy sheepskin rug, surrounded by a plethora of multicoloured cushions, lies in the middle of the floor. A corner table stands in the south-east. Above the table hangs a small wooden frame hammered into the wall with a rusty, oversized nail. The frame contains a picture of a steaming mug filled with coffee. Under the steaming mug, exuding the smell of a fresh cuppa, there is a handwritten line of text. A broom stands next to the exit in the north.

      <desc>On one of these cushions lies a slightly unravelled ball of white wool. A rather plump black cat appears out of nowhere, grabs the wool and toys around with it for a bit, before it lays the wool out in the shape of an arrow pointing to the north. After a few seconds bothy the cat and the wool have suddenly disappeared..

a thick stone wall, about three feet high, bordering the edges of a vast 
property.  Many generations of offspring of the orchard stand alongside 
patches of wild grass randomly out in the fields to the east and west.  The 
paved road is a bit dirty and old with small cracks forming in the pavement.

    <desc>Snaking if from the south, the street suddenly widens into a large circular 
area of pavement with a patch of grass and trees sitting in the center.  A 
row of carefully cared for trees line the edges of the pavement in the area. 
 Charming little cottages sit to the east and west, slightly obscured behind 
the veil of trees lining the road.  Sitting in between them is a small 
island of well tended grass with a small young apple tree planted in the 
center.  To the north lies a capacious orchard house with an expansive 
orchard extending into the distance.

    <desc>This fairly spacious one room house is, unlike many in the area, made of 
wood.  A white brick fireplace protrudes from the eastern wall, a small 
mantle sitting above the opening.  A grandfather clock sits in the 
northeastern corner.  In front of the fireplace sits a red armchair and a 
matching settee.  Opposite the fireplace wooden counters lines the wall, 
many storing food from the orchard, with an iron stove on the northern end.  
To the east a white-sheeted bed and a dresser sit in a pocket of the wall, a 
red curtain stretching across the gap.  To the north a sliding glass door 
sits between two glass windows allowing the light into the room.  Double oak 
doors lie on the southern wall, two narrow windows surrounding it.

    <desc>This medium-sized stone cottage is almost drowning in honeysuckle flowers.  
Soft, white light filters down from bright strips of light on the ceiling, 
but the room is still quite dim because a lot of the light is obscured by 
the many potted plants hanging from the housetop.  Lying along the south 
wall is a large, queen-sized bed, which is covered by a flower print 
bedspread.  In here, moving about is seriously hindered by all the potted 
plants on the floor.  Opposite of the door is a small kitchen, which seems 
to be the one place where there are few plants.  The north wall features a 
large comfortable armchair sitting beside a rusty watering can.  To the east 
is the exit.

    <desc>This medium-sized orchard stretches far into the distance, with rows upon 
rows of fruit.  The eastern half of the orchard is made up of apple trees, 
while the western half are pear trees.  Narrow dirt paths, running north to 
south, stretch out between the many rows of the orchard.  Scattered 
throughout the place are tall, stable stepladders positioned near the trees. 
 The apples growing here look fresh and seem to be nearly ripe, but the 
pears, on the other hand, are nearly as hard as rocks.  To the south is the 
exit.

Leaks of sunlight slip through the small holes in between the leaves and 
branches.  To each side of the path, large, thick, bushes block the way.  
Roots from the nearby trees grow up and over the path against the ground, as 
well as vines and grass.  Directly north the path continues into Hogsmeade, 
and the road forks leading into a shop to the southwest, and the continuing 
path to the east, turning southeast a short distance later.

    <desc>The harsh frames of towering yews cast deep shadows upon the cobblestone 
path of Wheelbarrow Avenue.  The surface of the road is covered in cracks, 
bumps, and other signs of poor upkeep.  A tall lamppost stands beside the 
road, although no light shines from it.  Below pitiful, sun-deprived plants 
wilt and die in the shade of the yews.  They are along most of the road, 
which continues to the northeast and southeast.

which is occupied by a pair of English Yew trees.  The cobblestones of the 
circle are better maintained than those of the road leading to the High 
Street to the southwest.  To the Southeast is an old shop with darkened 
windows.  A sign hangs on the door, and is the only indication that business 
is still done there.  To the Northwest of the circle is The Hanged Man Inn.

    <desc>.  The Hanged Man Inn is one of the must architecturally unique buildings in 
Hogsmeade. Shaped like a star, each point of the building is dedicated to a 
different specialty. Although they are really more like separate rooms, each 
section is referred to as a &quot;Wall&quot;. There are the two &quot;cafeteria Walls&quot;, 
&quot;entrance Wall&quot;, &quot;Gift shop Wall&quot;, and the &quot;Quidditch Wall&quot;. In the centre 
of the star is the bar. The atmosphere of the room is a general uptight one; 
due mainly to tourists with packed schedules that must go exactly according 
to plan.

      <desc>In the southeastern corner of the star-shaped building is the entrance Wall. 
Triangularly shaped, the section gets larger as it moves towards the centre 
of the Inn. There is a door in the slimmest part of the Wall, and along the 
north east side of the Wall there are many owls on racks just waiting to be 
used. To the south west There are coat racks and complimentary newspapers.

      <desc>In the west section of the star is the Quidditch Wall. The Quidditch wall is 
full of large, black chairs which are facing WWN devices in pairs of four. 
Nearly eleven feet in the air is a solid piece of glass. In the six-feet of 
space between the glass and the ceiling are snitches, bludgers, and 
quaffles. They fly around at random, banging off the walls, glass, and 
ceiling, though seemingly unable to break free of their transparent cage. 
They are always a sight of amusement for young children.

      <desc>In the east and south west sections of the star are the cafeteria Walls. The 
Walls are identical in shape, decoration, and atmosphere. The floors are 
orange with white slashes artistically slicing through them. The thirty-odd 
tables are golden with white tops. Candles float happily through the air, 
lighting themselves at night and dancing around unlit during the day. In the 
very rear of the Walls lay the food tables, where the days specialties are 
laid out for all to take as they please.

photographs of the owner and the staff for sale. Sample soaps and shampoos 
from the rooms are lined up ready for purchase, as are rug cleaners and 
detergents for laundry.

      <desc>Elevated by two feet and standing in the centre of the star is the bar, 
commonly referred to as &quot;Eddie's Wall&quot;, in dedication to the old - and only 
- bartender who has been working there all his life. Made of cherry wood, 
the bar is a perfect square. Free drinks come with the rental of a room, 
though most people find themselves leaving more-than-generous tips for the 
old man.

    <desc>Even at midday almost no light at all penetrates through the dark glass of 
the windows into Kassan's Kollectibles.  The wood floor is bowed with age.  
There is a large mantle surrounding the massive stonework fireplace, dark 
runes set into it seem to serve an ancient dark purpose.  Atop the fire 
rests a bubbling cauldron.  The air is rife with the smells of whatever foul 
potion brews there and heavy with its humidity.  Across from the fireplace 
is a high counter of darkened hardwood, an ancient and certainly bewitched 
strongbox serves as the till.  Behind the counter there is a large wall of 
many containers, none of them marked.  There is a small display table near 
the front of the store which bears whatever special Kollectible Kassan, the 
shopkeeper, has chosen for the time being.

feet wide by thirty feet deep.  It is walled on all four sides: the 
southwest side being the back of the Hanged Man Inn, and the other three 
being a dense hedge of Irish Yew fifteen feet high and so dense that no 
light passes through.  There are hanging lanterns along the sides of the 
hedge, though they seem to do little more than cast deep shadows.  The only 
exit here is to the southwest, back into the Hanged Man Inn.

    <desc>Finding their fence to be an easily conquered barrier, the plants from the 
cottage garden to the east have slowly encroached on the land and pathway 
that lie here. Among the more common lilacs and tulips sprout peculiar 
species of flora: violently orange flowers that sway even in the absence of 
wind as though they are dancing to an unheard melody, fanged geraniums, and 
one tiny, night-black flower that seems to sparkle with all the light of the 
stars at it's centre.  The pathway leads eastward through the gate of the 
cottage garden and curves towards the southwest.

      <desc>This tiny flower is the colour of ink, so dark it seems to leech the colours 
from the vegetation around it. At it's centre is a strange glittering mass, 
hypnotic in it's attraction. As you observe, a curious dragonfly hovers 
closer and is engulfed in a strange cloud of mist that the flower emits. 
When the air clears you can clearly see the dragonfly lying on the ground at 
the flower's feet, dead.

    <desc>This flowerbed is filled with a colourful array of plants.  There are bright 
yellow buds, vibrant red and orange tulips, and pale lilacs.  The plants 
have sprouted randomly within the garden, as if someone threw seeds into the 
ground without looking.  Aside from the regular variety of plants mentioned 
before, the garden is dotted with some rather unusual magical plants.  A 
long vine, braided into the trellis, is covered with sickly green leaves 
that wriggle unpleasantly.  Just below are some geraniums that would look 
mundane if it weren't for their long, sharp fangs.  Along the edge of the 
garden a large, leafy bush quivers noticeably.  A short path has been made 
with stone slabs through the garden, starting at the street to the west and 
ending at a cottage to the east.

    <desc>The wooden floor of the cottage, partly covered by a negligently-set Persian 
rug, is covered with items of all shapes and sizes, including a large, empty 
Pensieve and a few Foe-Glasses.  Many splinters rise up from the 
floorboards, marking the places where heavy objects have been dragged, 
magically or otherwise.  The wood-panelling on the walls is interrupted by a 
large, stone fireplace surrounded by shelves upon shelves of wheezing, 
squeaking, moaning, and coughing devices.  Spherical bowls hang in mid-air, 
just beneath the flat ceiling, emitting a bright light into their immediate 
surroundings.  The large, comfortable, dark-blue sofa in the centre of the 
room is surrounded by spare parts suitable for a great many different 
devices.  Some ten feet away stand a small, mahogany table and a chair.  An 
oven and a small cupboard are placed next to the table, towards the south.  
Every item has been meticulously cleaned, although the surfaces that hold 
them are covered by a thick layer of dust.  The door of the cottage lies 
west.

      <desc>The mahogany table is surrounded by pieces of magical devices in various 
states of decomposition.  A few fragile-looking instruments made of glass 
are piled on the table around a very dirty plate which looks as though it 
hasn't been cleaned in weeks.  A fork and a knife are buried in the terrible 
mess, bearing the marks of repeated usage.  A faulty Sneakoscope rests above 
a small cup with chipped edges.

      <desc>The stone fireplace is dusty and chipped in many places.  Logs have been 
haphazardly thrown on top of each other in a less-than-steady pile, burning 
low with constantly-flickering flames.  A thick layer of soot crushes any 
attempts the flames make to reach the twigs placed lower in the pile.  Floo 
Powder trickles down from its already-patched bag, falling into a neat heap 
ten inches from the fireplace.  The fire turns a light tinge of green 
whenever a particle of the fine, magical dust touches the logs.

path and every now and then something that looks like a chestnut, but is 
golden in colour, falls on the ground.  Some of the cobblestones sparkle in 
the light of the few, tall, oil lamps standing here.  A squirrel runs over 
to the chestnut and grabs it.  The path continues to the east and southwest.

beautiful willows bloom by the sides of many slithering, intersecting 
rivulets.  Many flowerless weeds crawl by the waterside, their leaves an 
aquamarine, algae-like colour.  At all times of the day, the sky is tainted 
in the dark-blue colour of a deep sea and the air smells salty and rich.  
Snails and frogs crawl and hop along the rivulet banks, their constant 
rustling reminiscent of a many-legged creature.  A house is visible to the 
south, while the beginnings of a stone road lead northeast.

Small bowls are caught on a perpetually waving string attached to all the 
walls.  The blue lights within flicker peacefully, spreading a gentle glow 
over the entire chamber.  Strong, wooden chairs, with beautiful carvings 
etched into their backs, stand around a rectangular table placed slightly 
off-centre, to the south.  An eerie voice sings in the background, 
accompanied by the sweet sounds of gentle harp-music and the soft rustle of 
willows.  Blue windows allow a generous amount of light inside, over the 
upper edge of a wooden bench.  The chill of the unheated chamber is soothed 
by an ever-present, warm, salty breeze.  A soft creaking coming from the 
wooden floorboards accompanies every movement.  The door lies north.

pallets cutting the air very noisily.  Hay is piled on the wooden floor in 
an imitation of a rug.  A single candle, encased in a transparent container, 
spreads a vague light around the Mill, masking its emptiness in a shroud of 
darkness.  The entrance lies to the west.

Its branches are bent low, almost horizontal, shading the area all around.  
Their tips are worn away by old age and it appears that the entire left side 
of the tree has been, at one point, burnt by lightning.  A few of the 
thicker roots have surfaced, avidly seeking nourishment.  The tree is 
surrounded by a low wall, atop which stands a board.

    <desc>The path bends northeast just north of a small, elegant-looking house, 
preceded by a small, rose-filled garden.  There are two small lamps perched 
on the outer wall of the garden and two larger streetlights stand opposite 
them.  There is a sense of peace in the air and the powerful scent of roses 
in the nearby garden mixes with the wild perfume of the two willows on the 
north side of the street.  To the west, the road goes on to meet a main 
Hogsmeade artery.

    <desc>Middle-aged oaks with strong trunks and mature boughs stand on both sides of 
the street.  Their outstretched arms extend in all directions in a 
protective, nearly fatherly fashion.  Shaded by the tall, graceful trees, 
small houses peek meekly at passers-by with rounded, green eyes.  The path 
continues northeast and southwest.

continues northeast and southwest.  On the southeastern side of the road 
stands a large, brass bell, with a text etched upon it.  Its guardians are 
two beautiful, black, winged horses etched in stone.  They are shown rearing 
and throwing their heads back proudly in a fierce display of dignity.

    <desc>Houses line Founder's Street on both sides.  To the southeast, however, 
stands a derelict building with two floors.  Ivy has crawled up the entire 
house, embracing it tightly with its thin fingers.  The front garden is full 
of weeds that have suffocated all the other plants.  To the northwest is a 
magnificent, three-storey building, with a handsome garden preceding it.  
The road continues southwest and northeast.

    <desc>This formal English Wedding Garden is surrounded by a yew hedge; the dark 
green velvet-textured foliage contrasts with the flower colours of deep 
reds, purples and oranges in the west border to pastel pinks, blues and 
yellows in the east border.  White flower colour accents meld both borders 
with a Victorian-style pavilion at the north end.  The elegant, 
cream-coloured pavilion is accented by a traditionally laid blue stone floor 
and walk that surrounds a large lawn for wedding ceremonies.  The entrance 
to the garden is a large wooden archway with Red Surfina and Hanging Lobelia 
trailing down either side of the arch.  At the top of the archway is a sign.

different creatures hang down from the rafters, posed in lifelike effigy.  
Various eagles, falcons, and hawks, two small dragons, a hippogriff, and an 
Aethonan are a few of the myriad creations that fill the air.  Along the 
walls, other assorted creatures, both natural and supernatural, strike 
poses, each according to their natures.  Deer, rabbits, birds, and diverse 
other mundane creatures, adorn the shelves in this shop.  Besides the 
creatures filling the air, a Fwooper, a Kappa, and a Niffler are just a few 
of the more exotic animals that come into view.

of the street.  Flowers and friendly vines embrace their walls tightly, with 
red and dark-green dots and streaks.  Mirroring them, the buildings to the 
southeast have white flowers dangling down their walls, interlocking with 
ivy.  An air of friendliness and contentment hangs above the entire area, as 
if secreted from the very pavement.  The lane continues northeast and 
southwest.

    <desc>What looks like the living room of a house is filled with large, wooden 
shelves propped up against the walls.  A few torches in grey, iron brackets 
cast a lovely, warm glow upon the small shop.  The entire southeastern 
corner is dedicated to children younger than eleven.  A few, coloured 
curtains offer them privacy, while they play with the numerous fake wands, 
vanishing brooms, creaking dollhouses, and self-reading books.  The shelves 
are filled with toys for all ages, boys and girls, from 
Apparating-and-Disapparating, plastic spiders to the loveliest growing-up 
dolls.  Also on display are knitted pullovers, scarves, and socks of all 
sizes, the more expensive with moving models of brooms or Snitches on them.  
Baby spoons, cutlery, and a vast assortment of food are stored some distance 
away from the clothes, in a tidy rack.  A small sign standing by the 
northern entrance reads: &quot;Welcome to Linda's!&quot;  A rickety door behind a 
colour-changing counter leads south.

    <desc>Broken or half-formed toys litter the floor of the small cottage.  A 
moderate-sized bed is covered with many children's clothes in various stages 
of completion.  Three pairs of self-knitting needles are tirelessly working 
in mid-air, while a few, broken ones have fallen on the floor in a heap 
resembling a half-finished game of Pick-Up-Sticks.  Two candelabra burn 
steadily in a tender, orange glow, which caresses the walls and floor of the 
cabin in ever-changing clouds of light.  Three bookcases in the shapes of 
crawling, sitting, and eating babies stand against the eastern wall, while a 
few necessities of life are piled up in the southwestern corner.  A merry, 
crackling fire burns in a fireplace shaped like a child-sized broomstick.  
Only the beginning of a nail can be seen by the fireplace, since its tail is 
masked by a few baby-sized robes and pyjamas.  A few cats roam about, 
sharpening their claws on whatever piece of cloth they can find.  The 
entrance to the house lies north.

      <desc>To the southwest of the room, a small stove neighbours a cupboard full of 
bread, blunt cutlery like for children, and always fresh replenishments of 
cookies.  In a basket set upon the cupboard are vegetables: small, round 
radishes, heaps of salad, tomatoes, carrots, and spinach leaves.

    <desc>Large, tidy houses in shades of grey and white line the street on both 
sides.  In season, gardens of fresh magnolias and daisies lavishly stretch 
towards the feet of the road, trying to snatch up as much space as possible. 
 Small whirlwinds of dust rise in fantastic shapes, clashing against the 
paved lane, only to be raised again with the next blast of wind.  Founder's 
Street goes on to the east and west of this point.

    <desc>A crisp breeze makes the linden trees at the side of the street sigh deeply. 
 A few bushes grow around their thick trunks, embracing them lovingly with 
spiralling long fingers and scarlet fingernails.  Butterflies and bumblebees 
fill the air with their busy buzzing.  Tentative twigs tickle the air in 
faint rustles, spreading a soft, sweet scent in the immediate surroundings.  
Founder's street stretches further east and west.

standing on both sides of the streets are vigorous and tall.  Their leaves

majestic trees, to the east and west.

main street, heading north towards a cheerful garden that precedes a large,

    <desc>A low, wooden fence surrounds the tiny front garden, filled with flowers in 
delicate shades of mauve and white.  A small, cobblestone path leads from 
the small gate to the door of a cheerful, brown house.  Delicate scents of 
lavender and musk are ever-present, as is the whisper of fresh water.  A few 
rivulets slither through the dark-green bushes, their water breaking into 
droplets as it cascades over Snitch-sized stones.  To the south lies Founder 
Street, while the Seven Rivers Cottage stands to the north.

    <desc>The inside of the cottage is very cheerful, although a little chaotic.  A 
small cradle stands along the eastern wall, while a large, Queen-sized bed 
lines the northern wall.  A rickety, six-person table stands towards the 
southern side of the cottage, surrounded by six chairs, three of which are 
decorated merrily with flowers.  A few sets of robes are carelessly draped 
around the chairs or lying on the clean floor.  Some necessary cutlery is 
stored on the western side of the chamber, beside a small stove.  About ten 
feet away from the stove, there is a cosy fireplace, with an ever-crackling 
fire.  A few candles burning with Everlasting Fire line the walls.  The 
light from the two arched windows on the southern wall reaches out in all 
directions, soothing and mild.  A bookcase stands along the eastern wall, 
some five feet away from the cradle.  A few slippers are spread all over the 
room at odd intervals, very far away from the shoe rack in the southwestern 
corner.  The door lies to the south.

      <desc>The grey bricks of the fireplace are darkened slightly by over-enthusiastic 
flames.  Green traces of fine dust litter the floor in strange patterns, 
beneath the bag of Floo Powder that is hanging from a flower-shaped nail.  
An insignia of seven, criss-crossing rivers is carved into the arched top of 
the fireplace.  Red flames keep moving like possessed, shape-changing, Gipsy 
dancers, throwing their heads back every so often in fierce abandon.

oak.  Powerful, knobbly roots delve deeply in the patch of dark soil beneath 
it.  A low wire is tied to the four posts standing at the corners of the 
squared, green enclosure.  The tree is moderately old and its large branches 
steadily shade a great portion of the road around it.  Founder's Street

flowers avidly open like hungry, expectant mouths.  Snakes slither through 
the thick, muddy soil.  A derelict house, covered in vines, stands to the 
north.  A wooden porch is covered in moss and broken-through by insistent, 
strong weeds.  A small wooden gate leads south to Founder's Street.

      <desc>There is a chilly feeling about the house.  Its windows are boarded and 
parts of it have fallen into disrepair.  The roof is chipped in many places 
and the chimney has collapsed within itself.  The old, green paint is slowly 
eroding away from the dirty walls, falling in thick, squelching smudges.  
The front door has dark lines carved into it, as if savage claws had ripped 
at it in a moment of fury.

    <desc>The cottage is dark, murky, and derelict, as if part of a particularly 
smelly swamp.  Its windows are boarded from the outside and the only light 
in the house is given by two small candles standing in dirty, glass bowls.  
Spider webs and thick, green algae creep up the wooden walls of the cabin, 
engulfing an empty, old bookcase and a few paintings.  The floor is covered 
with sickly-looking, green moss, while the ceiling is invisible beneath the 
thick layers of ivy and other weeds.  A single chair stands before a small 
table, in the northeastern corner.  The house is chilly and there is a thick 
scent of rot and death in the air, as though from a nearby decomposing 
corpse.  The entrance to the cottage lies south.

      <desc>The table is round and small, made of oak.  Deep lines cut its surface, as 
if heavy objects, with sharp, iron edges, have been regularly dragged across 
it.  There are many stains of questionable-looking liquids upon the table 
top.  The only chair in the cottage stands nearby, against the eastern wall. 
 Viscous, green fluids slide thickly down its surface, as if secreted by its 
hinges.

on the other.  Two everlasting gas lamps on either side of the building 
light this track.  The house is made of old red bricks, and covered in ivy 
from the ground to the very tip of the roof.  Mice have made their home in 
it and keep running in and out through the broken windows.  A purple rose 
bush grows next to the door of the building.  The track continues to the

    <desc>Suddenly the surroundings of this track are surprisingly lush and green.  A 
small sign saying 'potion plants' can just be seen under the leaves of a 
giant blue orchid.  The flower almost looks as if it has eyes.  Or has it?  
The lake can be seen in spots where the planting is thin.  Everlasting gas 
lamps are nearly completely hidden by bindweed, trailing up the posts.  It's 
possible to go either east or west.

    <desc>Dirty, torn balls of grass patch the lonely, shabby road as it descends into 
a wide ditch that looks and smells like the footprint of a 
particularly-filthy giant.  Wild herbs grow all around the area, in thorny 
heaps that look like porcupines ready to defend themselves.  The rustle of 
murky, thick water is audible nearby, and an accompanying orchestra of frogs 
and toads comes from the west.  A savage wind sends the weaker of the weeds 
hurtling through the air to patch yet another invisible hole in the path.  
East and west, the lane hitches up somewhat, to higher ground.

toads.  Toads, all running in the same direction, leave behind shimmering 
trails of slippery slime on the ground.  Along the track, some stones 
emanate a fluorescent red light.  To the north there is a blank wooden sign, 
held together by a rusty nail, hammered into the ground.  This track 
continues to the east and west.

    <desc>Here the cobbled stones of the eastern pathway are few and far between, all 
of them overtaken by moss and other vegetation. Packed dirt comprises the 
rest of the track, which is lit on either side by enchanted candles hung 
from tree limbs. A few rotting apples are evidence of the tree that lies to 
the west, most of them shriveled havens for insects of all varieties. The 
path stretches east to west, and in the far distance a lake can be glimpsed.

This area of path is regularly tended to. There are a number of flowers growing along either side. The path is wide enough for four carriages to easily pass side-by-side and yet it is perfectly level. There is a row of bushes just behind the flowers and each bush is a perfect square. The path leads east and west.

    <desc>. The dirt track is lit by only a few everlasting gas lamps.  In the distance 
the cries of birds, settling around the lake next to this path, can be 
heard.  Every now and then one of them flies overhead carrying a bit of this 
or that, usually snippets of paper.  This track could take you either east 
or west.

  The lack of permanent lighting on this path seems to serve as a silent warning to not travel this way at night. It appears someone spent a long time hacking away at the woods to make the path wide enough for one carriage. There are large claw marks in the earth. To the north there is a small puddle of blood. The path leads west to High Street and east.

    <desc>The minuscule station is made of assorted brick.  A thin coat of soot covers 
the terminal with one small window set in the eastern wall.  The dirty floor 
seems barely touched.  The majority of the room is taken up by a small, 
cramped waiting area holding several benches.  A small sign hangs on the 
wall.  Outside the station a tiny, narrow platform allows passengers to 
board or exit from the train.  The road to the west leads to Hogsmeade while 
the north road heads toward Hogwarts.

    <desc>The narrow path parts in three ways.  To the south stands a small, 
cosy-looking building made of bricks.  Shadows play to the east and west of 
it with the caprices of the weather, expanding and shrinking like a giant 
turning slowly in his sleep.  The path leading northeast towards Hogwarts 
looks dark and tense, as if about to erupt into a screaming storm at any 
time.  Two oaks stand on either side of the road that lies northwest, 
looking like two steady guardians crossing many-edged bayonets above the 
lane.

    <desc>A worn, weather-beaten, heavily-scarred bench stands by the northern side of 
the path, facing a thicket of particularly-thorny rose-bushes.  Their wild 
flowers, in pale tones of pink and yellow, look distant, melancholic, but 
unbeatably proud.  The sweet scent of flowers softens only very lightly the 
dank stench of dust and mud that heavily hangs in the air.  A fierce wind 
has bent the few oaks neighbouring the bench so that their trunks are 
contorted in anguish, their old wrists and elbows knobbly and swollen.  The 
road wearily hobbles along southwest and northeast.

      <desc>The old bench has numerous scratches all over its surface.  Many couples 
have scribbled their names in the wooden surface, in different tinges and 
letter types.  In the centre of the bench, a moving, palpitating heart 
pushes all other names around it away.  There are two initials encompassed 
in the heart: J and L.

    <desc>When in season, many flowers in lovely shades of scarlet, white, and mauve 
grow on both sides of the road, protected by old, knobbly oaks.  Fresh grass 
surrounds the trees forming a soft, lush, perfumed carpet.  The path 
serpentines gently, its unsteady contours marked by an overgrowth of 
dark-green weeds.  The vague outline of Hogwarts can be discerned to the 
northeast, while Hogsmeade Station lies southwest.

    <desc>Two tall, strong oaks are guarding the narrow lane that leads from Hogsmeade 
Station lying southeast to a main Hogsmeade artery northwest.  Their 
branches meet in a sort of military salute as they stand proudly on either 
side of the path.  The road underneath is slightly invaded by grass and 
weeds which have expanded tentatively from their regular lining of the path. 
 A discrete, sweet perfume lingers in the damp, peaceful air.

      <desc>Two strong oaks guard the road.  Their mature branches are twisted and

silence.

a thin brush.  On either side of the road, lonely oaks guard the path 
patiently, their foreheads brushing against the low sky.  In season little 
scarlet flowers smile upwards from amidst large patches of grass, refreshing 
the air with their soft perfume.  To the southeast looms Hogsmeade Station, 
while to the northwest the road continues towards a larger artery.

    <desc>The beginnings of a forest have been thinned out to make way for the winding 
road named Station Junction.  Occasional trees of varying sizes and 
thickness line both sides of the lane, patiently watching people and animals 
go by.  Their reassuring rustle sends waves of wild, fresh scents into the 
damp atmosphere.  A green rug of grass and low bushes covers the dark-brown 
soil, invading parts of the path with determined little fingers.  Hogsmeade 
Station stands southeast, while a Hogsmeade-bound artery lies northwest.

    <desc>The road bends slightly, clearing a path between what appear to be two parts 
of the same old oak forest.  Strong trees dig with their insistent, powerful 
roots into the edges of the dirty, occasionally bumpy, grass-covered trail.  
The scent of old bark hangs thickly in the air, filling the atmosphere with 
the dense tension of unfriendliness.  Thorny, flowerless bushes form 
threatening hedges by the roadsides and there is a permanent high-pitched 
creaking coming from all around.  Barely visible to the southwest is 
Hogsmeade Station, while to the west lies the junction with a large, 
village-bound artery.

    <desc>A motionless, menacing oak forest extends on both sides of the path.  The 
atmosphere is very tense and oddly quiet, as if the rustles of the trees 
have been muted by an invisible hand.  Crowded, thorny bushes creep across 
the ground, attempting to suffocate the grass-strewn, dirty, bumpy road.  
The air is thick with an unspoken sense of anger and the sharp smell of 
wilderness.  The road dives west into deeper woods that completely obscure 
the junction of the path with a larger village lane.  To the east, the trees 
mutely expand over the way to Hogsmeade Station.

      <desc>The forest is dark and threatening, as though each of the strong oaks holds 
an unspoken grudge against humankind.  The trees grow so close to one 
another that the air is suffocating.  Strong roots stretch in all 
directions, like a labyrinth of old, thick joints.  Hedges of thorny, 
unwelcoming bushes crawl in every available space, hugging the oaks and the 
murky-brown soil.  There is an eerie silence and very little movement 
throughout the woods, as though everything is dead.

    <desc>Surrounded on all sides by patches of dark, glum oaks, the clearing appears 
pleasantly out-of-place.  Small, white flowers tentatively decorate the 
sides of the slightly-irregular, grass-covered path.  The air is fresh, 
peaceful, and filled with a delicate, sweet perfume.  Faint whispers of 
water accompany the distant rustle of trees.  Quick patterings of small, 
hurried feet are sometimes audible from the surroundings, as if millions of 
invisible beasts were treading through the clearing, leaving no traces 
behind.  The way to Hogsmeade Station lies east, surrounded and suffocated 
by dark trees, while to the west the forest thins as the road leads towards 
a main village road.

      <desc>The dark cluster of trees looming at the edges of the clearing appears 
disgruntled.  The tall, sinisterly-twisted oaks throw their branches forth, 
as though trying to reach closer to the road.  Their roots are contorted 
backwards, as if forcibly kept away by an invisible barrier.  Filling every 
gap between them are interminable hedges of thorny, dark-green bushes.  The 
forest is unnaturally quiet and stern.

    <desc>The forest surrounding the road is thinning towards its western side.  A 
feeling of overwhelming pain and sadness hangs thickly in the dusty air and 
the trees are deformed and hunchbacked, as if under a great strain.  The 
road tiredly winds its way in slow serpentines, covered by small blades of 
grass that are retreating towards the edges of the path.  Shrunken, thorny 
bushes reach out to the road, with tortured, snapped fingers.  Fragments of 
twigs and leaves are spread all over the dirty, irregular lane.  To the 
east, the forest breaks into a clearing as it heads towards Hogsmeade 
Station, while to the west lies the way to a main village artery.

      <desc>The tormented forest sighs and moans in pain under the fierce blows of a

they do not falter; hunchbacked and twisted in painful knots, they still 
guard the path ceaselessly.

    <desc>The smell of rotting wood pervades the air here, where a decaying tree has 
fallen to the ground. The log lies alongside the road, now a refuge for a 
colony of tiny, silvery-grey ants. Dense foliage mats the forest floor and 
descends onto the dirt of the pathway in places. The fallen tree's living 
companions stand with a funereal air, as though mourning their loss. Their 
branches are bent earthward, perhaps under the weight of sorrow. They are, 
without exception, leafless. The only green along this section of the path 
comes in the form of a scraggly hedgerow, marching alongside the southern 
edge of the road. Imposing mountains can be glimpsed in the distance to the 
north. The pathway continues to the east and the west.

    <desc>Thick, creeping vines thrive in the shadows beneath the creaking trees. They 
resemble ivy in all ways except that their leaves have radiant crimson 
edges. A few have begun the long trek around the trunks of the trees and 
into their branches. The trees themselves slouch wearily across the dusty 
path, as though the weight of the vines is already dragging them earthwards. 
Their leaves are tiny, heart-shaped, and of such a deep green that they may 
as well be black. Every gust of wind that whispers through the forest 
carries with it a few more of the clinging leaves. Flowers, muted purple in 
colour, grow in vile-smelling clusters along the ground. The mountains 
display their majestic crests to the north; southward lies only heavy 
forest. The pathway stretches east to west.

      <desc>The leaves of this peculiar plant are beautiful when studied up close. A 
delicate fretwork of veins runs through each leaf, resembling nothing so

around the edge of each leaf is a band of stunning red, so brilliant it 
looks as though it were painted on.

    <desc>Large trees cluster along the southern side of the pathway, making it 
virtually impossible to see anything between their trunks and crooked 
branches. Northwards, the dark heads of mountains can be glimpsed, reared 
against the sky. Tiny toadstools dot the landscape, flourishing in the damp 
environment. The forest floor and dirt track are matted with leaves long- 
dead and creeping green vines. A number of rocks, weathered by wind and 
time, rest silently alongside the path, most overtaken with the same vines 
that have encroached on the road. The track stretches back towards the 
Hogsmeade path to the west and on towards the Hogsmeade Station to the east.

    <desc>Dense trees crowd the pathway, their clutching branches entangled. Moss, 
more black than green, has overtaken the roots and bases of most of them, 
contributing to the dank smell of the area. Toadstools, the majority of them 
sickly brown in colour, have sprung up among the dead leaves and twigs that 
cover the ground. A handful of the small fungi are bright green in colour 
and appear to have a luminescent quality. To the west this path collides 
with the road to Hogsmeade; eastwards it leads towards the Hogwards Station.

    <desc>This musty old cellar is pretty unremarkable.  Dust fills the corners and 
cracks between the stone slabs on the floor.  Some of the slabs have cracked 
or gone loose.  Many wooden boxes and crates are stacked here, labelled with 
things like &quot;order 7747, Carton of Pepper Imps, to be stacked&quot; and &quot;order 
2375, Exploding Bonbons, handle with care.&quot;  On the floor there are several 
square marks where the dust is thinner, showing where a box might have 
stood.  Up the stairs is the main shop.

    <desc>The sweet smell of the candy shop downstairs penetrates this room. Pale pink, brocade drapings adorn the two, tall and badly stained windows. A few shelves filled with odd-looking potted plants and a painting of the 'Honeydukes' shop front in the old days, decorate the mint green walls. A writing desk is placed against a wall and a fire mumbles softly in a richly decorated fireplace. The flagstones on the floor are laid out in an interesting pattern. A narrow staircase leads to the shop below.

    <desc>A thick layer of dust covers the large windows and the furniture in this room. Spiders have woven their homes between shelves and lamps. Furniture is covered with white sheets and a table with a broken top is placed in the middle of the room. In a corner of the room stands a suitcase, the torn, brown leather and cracks revealing its age.  A broken oil lamp is attached to the ceiling by a rusty chain. The creaking, wooden floor is mostly covered by a red, worn out rug, leading to a narrow staircase that spirals down.
