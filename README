This package contains the area data (rooms, mobiles, objects, etc.) that
was produced by various contributors for the Project Legilimensia between
2004 and 2010. Since the MUD is no longer running, it seems best to give
away this data in case somebody finds a use for it.

If you would like to use this data, please read the file LICENSE as well.

Many thanks to all who contributed.
